 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shushan Immortal Domain!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the highest place in the Clear Sky of Shushan. It was also rumored to be the place closest to the sky palace.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In reality, it was an exaggeration to say that one could see the sky palace from there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Shushan Immortal Domain was the tallest part of Clear Sky of Shushan. Only the Shushan Sword Sages were qualified to train there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a very steep ice mountain peak. Snow flew everywhere. Strong wind carried the icy snow and whistled past strongly. Mortals could never survive here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But this was also the place with the most spiritual qi in the whole divine continent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within the roaring snow storm were over 10 palaces that were built on this steep mountain wall. They were embedded within, and even if the snow storm was bad, these buildings were as steady as mountains. Even the wind chimes on the roofs did not move.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were the sword palaces of the Sword Sages.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing in Shushan Immortal Domain, when one looked down, they could see the great river of divine continent. They could see places afar. The common sword domain below seemed insignificantly small.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they looked up, it was a light grey turbidity. It was said that even the Seven Immortals of Shushan could not go past this endless turbid fog. In reality, many cultivators had given their all to fly up and try to pass through this endless turbid fog. They tried to reach that legendary sky palace in their mortal bodies. However, since ancient times, no one had succeeded. They would either lose their way through this turbid fog or die mysteriously. After they died, their bodies would fall from the sky....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Wu Yu came to such a high place, he would definitely be disappointed because this peak of the Clear Sky of Shushan, his dream land, could not enable him to see the sky palace at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sky palace was in the endless skies. Only people who had truly achieved dao could become immortals.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the highest peak of the Shushan Immortal Domain, there was a door. This was an ancient and simple wooden door. There was a circle carved on it. The circle symbolized reincarnation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beside this peak, there were several people floating around in the skies, staring at the circle. There were not many people here, but they were all important figures in Shushan, such as the Galaxy Sword Sage, the Lunar Flower Sword Sage, and the Grand Architect Sword Sage, who normally guarded the Endless Sword Sea.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The one in the lead was Nangong Xuan, the youngest of the Seven Immortals of Shushan, the Mizar Sword Immortal. Nangong Xuan was handsome and upright. His eyebrows were like swords. Snow covered the whole place and the wind was howling. However, his hair only flowed gently in the wind and his heart remained unwavered.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone's expressions were solemn.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a while, the Mizar Sword Immortal looked at the position of the sun in the sky and nodded. "It's almost time. They are about to come out."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he finished his sentence, the wooden door creaked. A dark-haired and solemn-looking young man gently pushed the wooden door open. You could see that it was just a small wooden house inside, as if there was nothing special.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man came out of the wooden house in high spirits. Behind him, there was a girl clothed in a pale red skirt. There were a nine-colored flames flying and dancing in her eyes like Phoenixes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These two were naturally Beishan Mo and Nangong Wei. In the past few years, they had matured a lot in terms of appearance. Of course, in terms of strength, they had reached an incredible level. Even when the Mizar Sword Immortal first laid eyes on them, he smiled knowingly and said, "Seeing you two, I am confident that Shushan's future will be bright. You two will rule the divine continent in the future. The day where Shushan will rise again and become number one in divine continent is just around the corner!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he was not truly satisfied with these two young people, the Mizar Sword Immortal would not feel this way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Behind him, Shen Xingyao, the Lunar Flower Sword Sage, the Grand Architect Sword Sage, and so on looked shocked. Looking at the eyes of these two young people, they were definitely different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyao was the first genius of their age. He could reach the level of the Seven Immortals of Shushan in the future, but compared to these two young people, he admitted that he was inferior to them. At least at their age, he could never have reached their level.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beishan Mo smiled proudly and said, "The great improvement I achieved today is because of the seven masters' careful guidance. It was also because the seven masters sent us into the Reincarnation Realm again. This is all to your credit. Big Sister Nangong and I are just lucky."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei's eyes were calm. She looked around and was probably getting ready to leave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Wei Er, how are you feeling? I didn't expect you to be able to keep up with Little Mo at the same cultivation level. It seems like you gained quite a lot in the Reincarnation Realm." The Mizar Sword Immortal looked at his daughter with a smile on his face. The more he looked, the more satisfied he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei once lagged behind Beishan Mo for a while, but she soon caught up to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Mm." Ever since Shushan had banished Wu Yu, Nangong Wei had always been in this state. Even the Mizar Sword Immortal could not make her smile or make her feel less stressed. In fact, this was also the reason why the Mizar Sword Immortal was more dissatisfied with Wu Yu, and even held some resentment towards him. His daughter was not like this before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nangong Wei's indifference caused both Beishan Mo and the Mizar Sword Immortal a headache. "Of course," Beishan Mo said hurriedly, "Big Sister Nangong has worked harder than me, and she is highly perceptive. She even helped me many times while training in the Reincarnation Realm."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he finished speaking, he looked at Nangong Wei, but Nangong Wei did not say anything. Beishan Mo was helpless. Every time this happened, his heart would be filled with resentment towards Wu Yu. Thinking of Wu Yu, he was about to ask the Mizar Sword Immortal about Wu Yu's recent situation. At this time, the Mizar Sword Immortal said directly, "Little Mo, Wu Yu encountered a little accident over there, so I have to tell you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What?" Beishan Mo asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When she heard this, Nangong Wei also looked over.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mizar Sword Immortal said, "You two entered the Reincarnation Realm first. I've told you before that Wu Yu won first place in the Trial of Yan and was qualified to enter the Yan Huang Ancient Well in Yan Huang Imperial City for six months. But a few months ago, a sudden piece of news came out. Wu Yu and another person called Luo Pin disappeared in the Yan Huang Ancient Well. The Yan Huang Ancient Well is as mysterious as the Reincarnation Realm, so the Yan Huang City Lord cannot control the Yan Huang Ancient Well completely. Apparently, the two have disappeared into thin air. Based upon past experience, I'm afraid that they will never appear again. They should be dead."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In general, the Mizar Sword Immortal was happy after hearing this news. Although it was not possible for Beishan Mo to defeat Wu Yu now and end his daughter's hope, at least with Wu Yu's death, they could save a lot of trouble. The shame that Wu Yu once brought to the Shushan Immortal Sect would be forgotten with time. After all, people would not boast about a dead genius.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thus, he had decided to explain the situation to these two youths directly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had joined Yan Huang Imperial City and won first place in the Trial of Yan. To be honest, Shushan had become the object of ridicule for a while. After hearing the news, many people cheered. The only regret was that Beishan Mo could not end the life of the traitor Wu Yu.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the news, Beishan Mo's expression did not look good, and he said, "How could this happen? Maybe it's some fake news released by them! I know that the Reincarnation Realm is dangerous, but it won't kill us! Wu Yu might not be dead. If he is dead, then the agreement I had with him...."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had absolute confidence in himself. In comparison, he naturally hoped to defeat Wu Yu in front of the whole divine continent. Of course, the most important thing was to show Nangong Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As for Nangong Wei....</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After hearing the news, her eyes twitched and she stared at the Mizar Sword Immortal. She was questioning and doubting him silently. At first, she did not believe the news.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She did not believe that Wu Yu would die just like that!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Mizar Sword Immortal waved his hand and said, "This news has already spread all over the world. Yan Huang Imperial City cannot disclose too much information about the Yan Huang Ancient Well, so the news is a bit vague. However, it's certain that when it reaches this level, no one will come out to refute it. This means that something's definitely wrong. It’s completely unnecessary for Yan Huang Imperial City to tell such lies. Yan Huang Imperial City would be the last one to use these kinds of cheap tricks. The chance of this being true is more than 90%."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hence, it was hard to have any hope for survival.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beishan Mo was very depressed and said angrily, "Wu Yu, that incompetent person, cannot even fight with me! He deserves to die! It's just that I've been preparing for this for so long!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had imagined that he would defeat Wu Yu in a fair and honest way, clean up all the slander Wu Yu had brought to Shushan, and prove himself in front of Nangong Wei. Now all his plans had fallen through.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When they were talking about this, Nangong Wei suddenly left and went down. Everyone was shocked. Beishan Mo was about to give chase when the Mizar Sword Immortal stopped him and said, "Let her calm down for a while. This is actually good news. According to the agreement, if Wu Yu were accompanied by the Imperial General, you would probably not be able to kill him. Now he is dead. After a long time, Wei Er will forget him. If one year is not enough, ten years will be. There is no way for a dead person to compete with you, and no one else in the world can compete with you."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Thank you for your guidance, Sixth Master!" Beishan Mo thought about it carefully. It was indeed a good thing. Even the Mizar Sword Immortal supported him so much. The whole of Shushan and all the people in the world thought that he and Nangong Wei were made for each other. With Wu Yu's death, no one could stop him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything would happen sooner or later.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beishan Mo thought about it carefully. In a few years, he would become the most powerful person in Shushan. Nangong Wei, as his dao companion, would assist him to lead the rise of the Shushan Immortal Sect, surpassing the Shangyuan Dao Sect and Yan Huang Imperial City. They would exterminate all demons as well! That was truly a wonderful thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He finally asked, "So, do I need to prepare for that day?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Mizar Sword Immortal said, "Prepare for it a little bit. At least for now, the news of Wu Yu's death has not been confirmed yet. We will just do our best. Whether he arrives or not on that day, we will prepare well and wait for him."　　</span></p>
