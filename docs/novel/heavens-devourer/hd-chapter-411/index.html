 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This immortal mystical dragon definitely had her objectives for being in Yan Huang Imperial City. However, she seemed to be a little interested with what had happened to Wu Yu before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This made Wu Yu feel a little overwhelmed and flattered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, she was just asking casually.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the two of them made their way through countless eyes and the tunnel that was managed by Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers, they were on their way towards the Battlefield of Old.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Soon, raucous cheers reverberated from ahead of them. There were seas of people who occupied both the ground and the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If they were Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers, one could tell from a single glance. However, there weren't many Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers around. Most of them were from various sects across the entire divine continent.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang Immortal Soldiers were responsible for maintaining order and receiving some important guests.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the first time Wu Yu was in the Battlefield of Old. At this juncture, he was on one of the mountain peaks around the Battlefield of Old. The Battlefield of Old was a valley surrounded by a ring of mountains. The area was extremely vast with tall mountains and tumbling rivers. Strong winds and lightning were common, and it was said that everything here seemed to be highly refined. Even ordinary rocks were exceptionally tough.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The Yan Huang Immortal Army was stationed around the ring of mountains and were responsible for receiving the people from important sects as judges. There was a total of five generals deployed. Other than General Qin, General Murong, and General Gu, Li Kuhai's godfather, General Jin Luan, and Jiang Zhixun's master, General Yugu, were here.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those third to fourth class sects could only watch from afar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Around the circle of mountains, the best spots were said to be reserved for the Shushan Immortal Sect, the Shangyuan Dao Sect, and other important sects. They had probably been invited by Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Other than the two giant sects - Shushan and Shangyuan - the Tianyi Race from foreign lands and several other second-rate sects with comparable strength to the Shushan Immortal Sect were also here. For example, there were people from the Gusu Fairy Peak, the Heavenly Ares Sect, the Fengxue Supreme Sect, the Imperial Thunderbolt Palace, and many others.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The representatives and sect leaders of these elite forces were also rather fearsome. They were likely close to the Mizar Sword Immortal’s cultivation level.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, there were even many demon scouts hiding among them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu arrived at the place and found the position where he should be standing with Luo Pin. He immediately spotted the crowd from the Shushan Immortal Sect. The group from Shushan roughly consisted of twenty-odd people. Among them, there were two Sword Sages, while the rest were young disciples. They had probably been brought here to observe and learn. For example, Chen Fuyou, Xiao Huanshan, and others were among them. Among them, Xiao Huanshan had even reached the Violet Kingdom of the Inner Sea Realm Realm. If Mu Lingche wasn't dead, she would probably be in the group too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These young disciples had been sent by Shushan to learn. When the crowd roared when Wu Yu arrived, they soon discovered Wu Yu. With Chen Fuyou as the leader of the group, they naturally looked at Wu Yu with disdain and with threatening gazes sweeping across him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If Shen Xingyao wasn't one of the two sword sages who had come, Wu Yu wouldn't have ever thought of walking over.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The other sword sage was the father of Chen Fuyou, the Crimson Shadow Sword Sage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Logically speaking, the Crimson Shadow Sword Sage had the greatest responsibility towards Mu Lingche's death. He had not fulfilled his duty to protect the group well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing that Shen Xingyao had arrived, Wu Yu informed Luo Pin about it before heading towards Shen Xingyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Sister Shen isn't here?" As he walked ahead, he looked around and didn't spot Shen Xingyu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyao answered, "After being outdone by you, she's finally willing to work hard. This time, I made her practice behind closed doors and thus she isn't here."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All the young disciples from Shushan were behind Shen Xingyao. Although they didn't say a word in the crowd, they couldn't hide their strong animosity towards Wu Yu from their eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, the Crimson Shadow Sword Sage said, "Galaxy Sword Sage, why do you have to speak so much to the traitor of Shushan? It wouldn't reflect well on you if news got out."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyao didn't pay attention to him and said to Wu Yu, "If you can get the guidance from the City Lord, you will likely experience a huge transformation. When I heard that you had earned the rights to participate, I was shocked. Make the best use of this opportunity."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu nodded his head in response.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the people from Shushan treating him as a traitor, Shen Xingyao was still as amicable as before. Wu Yu didn't have many friends in Shushan. Shen Xingyao could be considered one of his better friends.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shen Xingyao patted his shoulder and remarked, "Get back and prepare yourself. The only thing you will receive here is disdain from this crowd. As long as you don't feel guilty about yourself, it will be fine."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Rest assured. At the very minimum, I wouldn't be bothered by these people." Wu Yu smiled and took a glance behind Shen Xingyao. His eyes were like fire, and people like Xiao Huanshan couldn't meet him in his eyes. All they could do was avoid his tempestuous gaze.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu clasped his left fist with his right hand as he said, "Goodbye."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After which, he returned to Luo Pin before the eyes of Shen Xingyao.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The moment Wu Yu left, Chen Fuyou remarked, "Why is he still so cocky? He should be grateful to have left Shushan alive. Yet he doesn't know what's best for him and has fallen for Beishan Mo's plot. When he returns to Shushan in three years, it won't be that easy for him to leave alive!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Now that everyone knows about it, if he doesn't appear out of fear, his name will be ruined. I'd like to see if he has the face to remain in Yan Huang Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"What a dumbass, thinking he's part of Yan Huang Imperial City. Why would Yan Huang Imperial City place such high regard in a traitor like him? Do they prefer individuals who would betray them? He gave up Shushan so quickly. In the future, he could do it as easily to Yan Huang Imperial City. Traitorous slave!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Fuyou mumbled on and vented his frustration. The group around him was also nodding in approval.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xiao Huanshan added, "The are plenty of powerful centurions in Yan Huang Imperial City. Today, I'm here to see how he's going to embarrass himself. I have investigated his opponent, Yang Xuefeng, and he's a ruthless character. Wu Yu is definitely going to suffer a grave defeat. Just watch on if you don't believe me."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Alright. Let's leave it at that. If others heard us, they would accuse us of being petty." The Crimson Shadow Sword Sage waved his head and looked at Shen Xingyao beside him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, Shen Xingyao didn't care about what these young people were saying. A tinge of light flashed in his eyes as he stared at the Battlefield of Old.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Within two hours, all the participants had arrived. The 32 participants were all separated into two batches. One group was going to fight south of the ring of mountains, while the other batch was to the north. Wu Yu was with another 15 participants. Qin Fuyao wasn't part of his group, but Murong Xu and Jiang Zhixun were. However, they were chatting casually amongst themselves, and other people couldn't join their ranks at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For each battle, the north and south sides would each send a participant forward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For the subsequent round of battles, the remaining 16 people would be divided into two batches at the north and south again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Standing there and looking across, one could see millions of cultivators around. This was even more than the number of disciples of Shushan Immortal Sect. Undoubtedly, this battle would be the most watched in Wu Yu's life thus far.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yan Huang Imperial City indeed lived up to its name. The show they had put on was even more impressive than what Shushan could.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"My name is Murong Ting and I’d like to welcome all guests that came from all over the world to our Yan Huang Imperial City."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beyond the Battlefield of Old, an old man hovered in the air with his hands behind his back. He was none other than the well-known General Murong of Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">General Murong was courteous in his words and instantly drew responses and cheers from hundreds of thousands in the crowd. Instantly, the crowd grew exceptionally raucous and lively.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">General Murong continued, "At the same time, I would like to thank the Crimson Shadow Sword Sage and the Galaxy Sword Sage from Shushan, Shenqing Venerable and Tai'a Venerable from the Shangyuan Dao Sect, Minister Jin Chongtian from the Tianyi Race, and many others who are here."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were over 20 Shushan Sword Sage-level experts who had gathered, and General Murong gave a rough introduction of them.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In the end, he announced, "With that said, I shall not take up any more time. Let me announce the official start of the Trial of Yan. The first two contestants are Luo Pin and Hai Yu. Please step forward."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As known, Luo Pin was to first to fight today.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If she were to make her way through the stages, she would also be the first to start each time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her opponent was similar to Wu Yu's opponent. They had to defeat two other contestants for them to qualify and stand here today. She was at the north preparation stage. When her name was read, she jumped off and moved towards the center of the vast Battlefield of Old.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Looking ahead, one could tell that she was a girl too, and one who cared about appearances. She had turned her Yan Huang Immortal Armor into a sea-blue long dress adorned with gems and pearls as decorations. She was just like a fairy of the oceans. As she drifted forward and landed, the river that ran across the Battlefield of Old raged violently.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yu had even forgotten to look up information on Luo Pin's opponent, Hai Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Naturally, it wouldn't matter even if he did. This was because he knew that there was no way Luo Pin would lose to her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Luo Pin also got up, jumped up high in the air, and descended on the Battlefield of Old rapidly, leaving trails of afterimages behind. She instantly closed the distance to Hai Yu.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline"><span class="Apple-tab-span">&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the Battlefield of Old was huge, it would still take some time before they clashed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She traversed within the forest with agile movements.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The battle started right away. As this was the first battle, it attracted the attention of most people. Instantly, almost everyone held their breath and fully focused on the battle. A battle between two ladies of Yan Huang Imperial City.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Hai Yu was more gorgeously dressed and therefore naturally drew more eyes than Luo Pin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Both of them clashed above a giant lake. Instantly, the lake water was sent into the air and swept across.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The truth was that Wu Yu was holding his breath and watching Luo Pin's battle attentively. After all, this was his first time seeing her in battle with his own eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He saw that Luo Pin had an immortal treasure with her. It was especially stunning and entirely sea-blue in color. It was just like a sparkling gem of the sea, or a masterpiece of art that was as dazzling and attractive as the stars in the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It took the form of a trident.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Typically speaking, a girl using an immortal treasure like this would appear exceptionally domineering. Luo Pin was as such. That sea-blue gemstone-like trident was similar in length to her height. Luo Pin was able to manipulate it perfectly in her hands, and it was clear that her mastery was even beyond Wu Yu's mastery of the long staff.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"That's a dao treasure. It is just that she's hiding its power," said Ming Long definitively.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Are you sure?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"It goes without saying. Your old mother's pair of eyes are sharper than your tongue," Ming Long remarked proudly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As she finished her words, Luo Pin seemed to have executed a Heaven Earth Void technique. Instantly, ominous clouds gathered and a heavy downpour descended rapidly. A huge amount of rainwater fell on the entire Battlefield of Old and instantly shrouded everything in rain. Soon after, the vast amount of rain formed a deluge that resembled an infuriated dragon tumbling. As the dragon grew larger and larger, it engulfed her and the sea region.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ping, ping!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this instant, it was as though the Battlefield of Old had turned into an ocean before the eyes of the crowd.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This move was truly shocking and impressive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, it also made it hard for the crowd to see the actual battle within.&nbsp;</span></p>
