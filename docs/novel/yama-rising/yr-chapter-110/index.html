 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye walked in.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t well decorated. In fact, the entire coffee shop was in heavy disrepair. Old school movie posters were plastered all over its yellowish walls, while the old wooden boards of the floor reeked of the peculiar dingy stench of old coffee stains. The dusty overhead lights were dim and yellow.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His footsteps caused the floorboards to creak loudly. When Qin Ye opened the door, the first thing he saw was a young man with blond hair yelling loudly into his phone, “I’m the oracle. Lynch number 2. Don’t ask me why I checked on him. It’s my prerogative who I want to check on. Number 8 is just pretending… Oh… hello.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man probably never expected someone to even enter the shop. He immediately switched off his mic, “What do you want?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">I’ll rate your service standards a tragic one out of five!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye didn’t respond. Instead, he simply rubbed his hands as he glanced around, before asking, “Is this coffee shop open twenty-four hours?”</span></p>
 <p style><span>“That’s right. Someone takes over the night shift at six.” Seeing that Qin Ye didn’t appear to have any intention to order a drink, the attendant glanced at his cell phone from time to time. Qin Ye was rather displeased. </span><span style="font-style: italic">There’s such a charming specimen of a man standing in front of you right now, so how could still be in the mood to play Werewolf?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><span id="footnote-ref-6f75"><a href="#footnote-6f75">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">This baby isn’t happy.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you have a menu?” Qin Ye strolled around the shop as he asked.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... Cakes?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... Tea?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is a coffee shop…” The attendant’s eyes glanced at his phone and saw that others had already begun hurling all forms of allegations at him. He gritted his teeth and barked, “Shrimp noodles, gala noodles, huainan beef soup, we’ve got everything.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Come on, hurry up!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">I’m going to lose soon at this rate!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye coughed lightly, “Didn’t you say that this was a coffee shop… why does it feel like you’re selling something completely different from what I’d expected… What’s gala noodles? Can you give a brief introduction of it? I’ve not heard of shrimp noodles either…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">You can say that the quality is poor to the extreme!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The attendant switched off his phone with resignation, “Gala noodles is…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Give me a bowl of shrimp noodles.” As soon as Qin Ye saw the attendant switch off his phone, Qin Ye immediately placed his order.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Perfect.</span></p>
 <p style><span>The attendant swallowed his words and glared at Qin Ye. </span><span style="font-style: italic">Brother… that’s antisocial behaviour… are you messing with me…</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How many taels?!” He gnashed his teeth and barked at Qin Ye.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll have two taels.” Qin Ye smiled as he searched for table number four. The attendant turned around and yelled into the kitchen, “Two taels, shrimp!” Turning around, he noticed that Qin Ye was just about to take a seat at table number four, and he immediately yelled at him, “You can’t sit there!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye froze.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why not?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The attendant looked somewhat stunned. Seconds later, the attendant replied with much hesitance, “Someone has… reserved that table…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But he isn’t here yet, is he?” Qin Ye smiled and took his seat. He suddenly discovered that this attendant was rather cute and adorable.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Brother!” Unexpectedly, the attendant ran over and began pulling him by the arm, “You really can’t sit there…I’ll find you a better place. How about table number six instead? There’s a comfortable little couch there.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Dong…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Just then, the door opened with a soft sound. The attendant gasped and sprang back behind the counter.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Tuk… tuk…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The rhythmic pulse of a knocking sound silenced the dilapidated coffee shop. Seconds later, a silhouette stood at the door. One could tell from the gaps between the multitudinous advertisements that the visitor was very tall.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Creeaaakk…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;With a cringeworthy creak, the door opened slowly, and a strange-looking man walked in.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wore a fleece coat, a hat, sunglasses and a face mask. He even wore black leather gloves on his hand. There wasn’t much of his body that was exposed to the elements.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He didn’t appear too mobile either. Relying on the support of a walking stick, he slowly made his way over towards Qin Ye.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Tuk…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The floorboards sank slightly, and a figure that was approximately 1.85 meters tall appeared in the coffee shop. His voice was incredibly hoarse, “Is it… you?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I saw a new reply today.” The tall man stood with his back against the light and pointed at the seat across the table, “Please, have a seat. It’s on me today.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The attendant desperately sought to signal to Qin Ye with his eyes. Unfortunately, Qin Ye ignored the attendant, smiled faintly, and sat down.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Interesting.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man didn’t give off any Yin energy or corpse energy. But at the same time, his body was equally devoid of any traces of vitality.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as though he were a walking corpse hidden under the skin of a living person.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man wore an old coat that was visibly covered with lint, and he didn’t appear to be in good health either. The man was already panting by the time he sat down. He ordered a glass of plain water, and then turned to look at Qin Ye through his sunglasses.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You seem to have been… waiting?” Qin Ye was the first to speak up.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The attendant served the man water and quickly slipped away. Qin Ye gazed deeply into the man’s eyes and said nothing more.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man slowly set down the walking stick and picked up the glass of water. However, he didn’t drink from it. After catching his breath, he finally responded several seconds later, “That’s right… I’ve been waiting.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Every second of every day, I’ve been eagerly anticipating the moment when someone would respond to my post and accept my commission.” He leaned back into his seat somewhat wearily, “Thus, I came especially early to this place immediately after seeing your reply. I had hoped to meet you as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My name is Li Jiankang, and I’m forty-eight years old. I live here at the Tianxi Seafood Market.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no need for banal chatter.” Qin Ye turned around and saw the attendant serving up his food, so he waved his hand to indicate that he didn’t need the food for now. Then, Qin Ye turned his gaze back to the man’s sunglasses and continued solemnly, “Since we’re all in a hurry, why don’t we get straight to the point?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were several people searching high and low for the mysterious 40 teaching credits right now. Since Qin Ye had already taken the lead, he didn’t mind doing everything in his ability to stay ahead.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if somewhat surprised by Qin Ye’s straightforwardness, the entire room fell silent.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is something that only happened this year…” After a long time, Li Jiankang finally began, “I live by myself in the Tianxi Seafood Market. There aren’t many residents left in the vicinity because of the nearby demolitions works.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ve always had a cat. Its name is Jingle Bells. It’s an adorable black cat. It’s very obedient too, and hardly ever meows. But… ever since August this year, it… changed.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The glass in Li Jiankang’s hands rattled slightly. He drew a deep breath and continued hoarsely, “I didn’t notice it immediately. But then, it went on everyday for the next ten days or so. It would just sit outside the door, refusing to enter the house. Then, at approximately 11.50 p.m., it would begin meowing and crying persistently.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Can you believe it… It does the exact same thing everyday at 11.50 p.m. sharp… It can’t be in heat either, since it had previously already been neutered. It’s as though… as though there’s something in the house that’s creeping it out. It… doesn’t dare to enter the house.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Splash…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;His hands were now trembling so much that water had even spilt out of the glass. He set down the glass and leaned back into his seat to contain his shivers.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, one fateful night in mid-September… Jingle Bells came into the house for the very first time.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He closed his eyes and raised his head slightly. Yet he continued to grip tightly to the armrests on his seat as though he were a taut bow, “I still remember vividly what it looked like that night… Its entire body was hunched, and its hair was all standing on end. It glared at me cautiously with its green eyes, and it slowly approached me, step by step…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And then… it bit me.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He suddenly shot up from his seat and stared at Qin Ye as though he were a fraud, “Do you know something? Jingle Bells was practically acting like a frenzied beast. I-I had a feeling that it didn’t intend to bite me in the first place. Rather… it was aiming its fangs at something else… something right next to me… something right by my side!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Because it pounced straight for my shoulder as though there were an extra head growing out of my shoulder!!!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was panting hard by now.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His chest rose and fell heavily with his breaths.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Jiankang’s tone of voice had escalated so much that it was well over an octave higher than what it had begun with. After a protracted pause of approximately ten seconds, Li Jiankang raised his right hand and pointed to his glove. His voice had softened once more, yet there were still traces of breathlessness in his speech, “The bite was so deep that it left a scar on my hand. I had no choice but to go to the hospital. But I usually deliver my goods from midnight to 5 a.m. everyday, so I had to trouble a friend to help attend to my shop…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His voice trembled as though he were trying desperately to suppress the fear welling up in his voice, “But… but…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye lifted his eyelids and twirled a pencil casually on the table, “He’s dead?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no response.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seconds later, Li Jiankang finally muttered, “He’s dead.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“How did he die?” Qin Ye appeared hardly affected as he continued asking.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bitten to death…” Li Jiankang’s body shuddered uncontrollably. He wrapped his arms around his body tightly and continued trembling, “It’s definitely a case of an unnatural death… The bite marks on his body can only have been left by a massive, vicious beast. But, guess what…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His voice was laden with marrow-chilling horror as he stared at Qin Ye with his ghoulish eyes, “I asked a friend who’s a forensic analyst. His body was mauled and mutilated like how a wild beast would attack a human being, but the teeth marks… were made by man!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s… it’s caused by a person!!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The door was locked! The windows hadn’t even been opened! My friend… was in my house when he got… bitten to death by a human being!!!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Jiankang shrieked at the top of his voice. It was evident that his emotions were running wild. The attendant had already slipped away as soon as Li Jiankang had started his spiel, and the only two remaining in the entire coffee shop were the two who were seated at table number four right now. Li Jiankang’s voice reverberated throughout the coffee shop and lingered in the air.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Faint traces of sunbeams peeked into the musky, dusty shop, illuminating the dust particles that drafted through the air. A peculiar chill suddenly blanketed the already desolate shop.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Was there anything else?” Qin Ye probed further.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Jiankang’s body continued to shiver, “When I finally returned, I saw bloody scratch marks everywhere, on the bed and on the walls!! The scratch marks must have been left behind by human hands! It must be! He was bitten here…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He pointed to his own neck, “Half of his neck was gone… but, there was no blood…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The entire room was devoid of a single trace of blood. My friend’s body looked like it had practically been… sucked dry and shriveled up… Haa…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was clearly daytime, yet Li Jiankang was shivering like a sieve. It was almost as though… there was someone staring at him from behind. He pulled out a silken scarf and wiped off the sweat from his forehead. Qin Ye tapped his fingers on the table, “Do you have a wife or children?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They’re dead.” Li Jiankang replied mournfully, “They’ve passed on a few years ago…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Have you asked anyone else for help before?”</span></p>
