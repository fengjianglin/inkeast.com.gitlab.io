 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao was incredibly exhausted.</span></p>
 <p><span>He was currently approaching the border of Province E. From there, they would be no more than several miles from Insignia Province. In fact, they could already see in the distance a display board spelling out the words - “</span><span style="font-style: italic">Insignia Province</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You mentioned earlier… that people have to treat each set of circumstances with the appropriate attitude and personas..” He begrudgingly grumbled as he glanced at Qin Ye, who was playing games on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye had already finished switching modes some time ago, and his energy-saving mode replete with an apathetic outlook on life was now in full bloom. Wang Chenghao couldn’t help but feel like he was talking to a completely different person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He drove the car while Qin Ye enjoyed music.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He drove the car while Qin Ye played games on his phone.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He drove the car while Qin Ye idled about, counting the number of cars that were passing them by.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Why doesn’t this man learn how to drive?!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Brother Qin, my father once told me that driving is an important life skill…” Wang Chenghao repeated himself for the umpteenth time. They were on a journey that lasted thousands of miles on end!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Why is Qin Ye treating me like a mere driver?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">If only a philosopher would just appear in the backseat and teach him some life lessons!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">How could he just sit there idly while I drive the entire journey?! It’s as though he’s floating in an idyllic ocean of lethargy!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right, so it would be prudent if you invested more attribute points into this.” As soon as he finished speaking, Qin Ye swore under his breath and threw his phone at the seat. Wang Chenghao saw out of the corner of his eye that Qin Ye had actually just placed eighth on the leaderboards of the game ‘Cool Running Everyday’.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I say, you should get with the times and download some new games. For instance, I hear that whatchamacallit-Glory is a pretty good game.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Arrrrgghhhh… You actually have the nerve to advise me now…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With gritted teeth, they cleared the toll booth and made their way straight towards the City of Salvation.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It had to be said that it was only after entering Insignia Province that they realized how much smaller the population size of Insignia Province was compared with Westriver - it was but a mere fraction! The roads were clearly less packed, and the traffic flow was far smoother as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The City of Salvation was located on the edge of the Insignia Province, just adjacent to the border of the Eastsea Province. Its economy wasn’t considered as developed as the other parts of the country. After driving for yet another day, they finally crossed the City of Salvation’s border. From here, it would take another three to four hours for them to drive past several counties and into the heart of the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm?” Just then, Qin Ye suddenly did a double take.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Strong County was one of the counties located on the edge of the City of Salvation’s territory. It was built around the national highway, and both sides of the county were densely filled with shops and service stations, as well as hotels and gas stations. Qin Ye snapped his fingers, “Let’s stop here. We’ll rest here tonight before completing our journey tomorrow. We’ll be able to rest properly once we make our way into the heart of the City of Salvation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">It’s finally time to rest…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Wang Chenghao heaved a huge sigh of relief as Qin Ye led him towards a row of hotels.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ten minutes later, Wang Chenghao muttered, “Brother Qin… I’ve got money.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s called being discreet with your wealth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... What I mean is that we don’t have to be so particular. Really.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rodent, I’m not trying to nag at you, but you don’t really know the value of money until you start working for it. Are you earning any money now? Do you think hundreds of thousands is a lot of money? Have you already inherited your father’s estate? If not, it would be more prudent to use your present funds sparingly until the millions of inheritance arrives in your bank account.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao stared at Qin Ye for a few moments, before finally sighing in resignation and glancing in dismay at the guesthouse in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was dilapidated.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was absolutely decrepit.</span></p>
 <p><span>The neon sign which read “</span><span style="font-style: italic">Rujia Inn</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” glowed with a faint, red hue. The inn was located in the most remote corner of the street, just adjacent to an overgrown forest. None of the rooms were illuminated at the moment, and the two-storey building hardly looked inviting at all. Instead, the signboard was crooked, and save for the red hue, all other neon colours weren’t working at all. Given its current state, it was hardly any better than a shuttered, abandoned hotel.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact… even the main door was shut tightly, and not a single glow of light nor trace of sound could be seen or heard from outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao shuddered. For some strange reason, he felt a chilling sensation wash over him just as he sized up the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is this inn… alright?” He had encountered far too many bizarre incidents in recent times, and he couldn’t help but clutch pleadingly at Qin Ye’s sleeves as he weighed in on his concerns.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye’s gaze quivered slightly, but he maintained, “It’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s just that there’s some outstanding business... and I’d thought to close the loop while we’re here…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he finished speaking, he pushed open the door and marched right in.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao followed closely behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is anybody in?” Qin Ye leaned over the counter at the concierge and knocked on the table, “Where’s the boss? I’m looking for a room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">No response.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The entire inn was as quiet as a tomb.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Brother Qin… should we look for another place to stay at?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet before he could finish, a desk lamp suddenly switched on with a loud buzz.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A man with pale face, a small goatee and somewhat reddish eyes sat right under the light, staring straight at them. The man was beside them, and less than a meter away from Wang Chenghao.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Bloody hell!!” Wang Chenghao got the shock of his life.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">When did this old man show up? I can’t even hear his breath! No… he didn’t even make any sound that a normal person should be making, like fidgeting on his chair!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as though the man had sat as still as a corpse, waiting silently in the dark for the next guest to enter the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet Qin Ye remained completely unfazed, and he pulled out his identification papers, “Two people, king-sized bed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man didn’t pick up Qin Ye’s identification card.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was approximately fifty years old, yet the fact that his hair was already completely white made him appear as though he were close to seventy years old. The sheer number of years under his belt had left an indelible scar on his face - his wrinkles were deep, and he was so thin that he was practically skin and bones. Right now, he continued to stare transfixed at the two students in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Approximately ten seconds later, he finally spoke up with a hoarse voice, “We’re not accepting guests.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The other inns are full.” Qin Ye snapped his fingers indifferently, “Otherwise, do you think I would want to stay here either? Look at how run down your shop is. I’ll just make do for one night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man suddenly laughed, revealing a row of dark yellowish teeth. His voice sounded incredibly harsh to the ears, almost like a cat scratching on glass, “Do you really want to stay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye nodded his head, while Wang Chenghao shook his head fervently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man took Qin Ye’s identification card and didn’t say any more. Just then, it suddenly dawned on Wang Chenghao that this inn didn’t even have a computer for registration purposes. The only thing remotely electronic was the desk lamp. Even the registration of guests was handwritten.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“201.” As soon as the old man reported their room number, he switched off the light. Then, with the click of another button, the lights to the stairs came on immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was dim and yellow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Both the lights and the hallway were dim and yellow.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The building was incredibly old. It appeared to have been built in the style of the nineties. The walls were painted with a two-tone finish - turquoise below and white above. Unfortunately, the sheer number of years the building has seen meant that the vibrant colours had faded, and everything was simply yellowing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Countless autumn insects hovered about the lights in the inn. The lights were incredibly dim, and they barely illuminated a two meter radius around them. Apart from that, the rest of the inn appeared as dark as hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Gulp.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Wang Chenghao swallowed his saliva and clung tightly to Qin Ye’s arms as they made their way up the stairs together. Then, just as they arrived at the corridor, the old man’s voice called out again, “There’s a room beside the window… No matter what, don’t enter it…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At night… do not open the door… and do not go to the toilet… use the chamber pot if need be…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">What kind of outdated hotel from the history books is this?! How could you still be using a chamber pot?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The more Wang Chenghao thought about it, the more uncomfortable he felt. The unsettling feeling in his heart only escalated as soon as he entered the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The entire room stank with a thick, musky smell.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bedding was fine, but there was no TV. The window overlooked the wild forest just outside the hotel. When the night breeze blew, the gently swaying trees cast menacing shadows over the room, as though foreshadowing the arrival of a dreadful beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao immediately shut the windows at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let’s turn in.” Qin Ye lay down on his bed and prepared to sleep. Wang Chenghao was incredibly tired, and he, too, fell asleep almost immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Time passed by. When Wang Chenghao woke up again, rubbed his eyes and glanced at his phone, he saw that it was only 4 a.m.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He woke up with the urge to pee.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This stupid hotel doesn’t even have a stupid kettle!” Having lived like a prince for his entire life, Master Wang had never spent a night in an inn like this before. Cursing and swearing under his breath, he quickly got dressed and prepared to leave his room to head to the toilet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The toilet was on the first floor. He resented the notion of using the chamber pot at all costs. Thus, he opened the door and marched out at once.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sss…” He couldn’t help but gasp nervously as soon as he opened the door, “Bloody hell, why is it so cold… Insignia Province isn’t even considered the north. This rickety inn is so unnaturally cold.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hallway was enshrouded in pitch-black darkness. There was a light switch in front of the door to every room. As soon as it was switched on, the corresponding light in front of the room would come on. In other words, a person would have to flick four switches in order to reach the end of the corridor. It was a peculiar design that hardly made any sense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And the end of the corridor was where the gloomy window was located.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao rubbed his palms together nervously. The hallway was dimly lit with a faint yellow light. His surroundings were horrifically silent. The night breeze gently caressed the forest outside and stirred up a soft, rustling sound. A vast expanse of darkness hid beyond the local street lighting… almost as though it were concealing a terrifying secret.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He shuddered. If not for the fact that the need to take a leak was simply unbearable, he would never deign to consider using the toilet at this time of the night! This was practically a scene right out of a horror movie.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Click…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The second switch flipped, and another portion of the hallway was illuminated once more. The feeling of gradually illuminating an otherwise completely dark hallway was incredibly gripping and tense. Then, without any warning, his heart began to race.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as though… as though… something was hidden in the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, just as he flipped the third switch, he immediately froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A wave of immense terror washed over him, shooting straight from his tailbone into his mind and causing all of his pores to flare up with chills!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ahhhhhhhhh!!!” The screams of extreme terror echoed throughout the entire inn. Qin Ye was playing the game ‘Cool Running Everyday’ on his phone when his lips twitched uncontrollably, “Didn’t the boss tell him not to go out at night? Why is he acting in such defiance when he’s such a coward?”</span></p>
 <p><span>In the hallway. Wang Chenghao was so frightened that he leaned heavily against the wall.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Just now… it happened just now!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Generally, there should be a soft clicking sound for every button that was pressed. However, no clicking sound rang out when he attempted to flip the third switch earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was because… when he attempted to flick the light switch… he touched another person’s hand instead!!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wasn’t the one who had flicked the light switch!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">There’s a ghost… there’s a ghost!!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was so frightened that his hair stood on end. Right now, the only thought on Wang Chenghao’s mind was to rush back to his room, cast off his pride and cling tightly to Qin Ye! However, the moment he turned around…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Click…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first light switch went off.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The light in front of their room had suddenly gone off. His pupils constricted immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He saw it. In that instant that the lights went out... a lady wearing a long black dress was standing right there, just under the light!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She looked up. She was beautiful. However… her face was as white as snow, and her foot-long tongue hung out from her mouth!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just like that, she stood silently under the dim yellowing lights, in the middle of the deathly still hallways.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At four in the morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ahhhhhhh!!” Wang Chenghao was completely scared witless! Yet this was just the beginning. In the very next second, as soon as the second switch clicked and the second set of lights were extinguished, he suddenly noticed that… the lady… that horrifying lady with deathly pale appearances… was now suddenly standing only two meters in front of him!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as though she were moving forward just as the lights went out!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And she didn’t make a single sound at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“AHHHHH!!” The only thing he knew to do right now was to scream for his life. He didn’t dare to run back to his room at all, so he turned around and began running to the end of the corridor!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Click…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The third light switch went off. It was now completely dark behind him. It was practically yelling at him to flick the fourth switch right in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This time, there was no woman around.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Haa… haa… haa…” He was shaking madly and sweating profusely as he leaned against the railing. Wang Chenghao was on the brink of tears.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Left… h-h-has she left?” He wasn’t even conscious of the fact that he was muttered aloud with a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, his voice immediately stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Sha… sha....</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;A light rustling sound came from right behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">T-t-t-t-t-t-t…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;His teeth began to chatter uncontrollably. He was shaking so hard it was as though he were having seizures. Then, Wang Chenghao mechanically turned his head around and looked at the tightly shut door at the end of the hallway.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The innkeeper had mentioned never to approach this room at night.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Sha… sha....</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He heard it clearly this time, and he immediately knew… This was the sound of something on the other side of the door… scratching the door with its nails!</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yama Rising is finally hitting the shelves! I'm absolutely stoked about this novel simply because of its sheer magnitude and epic proportions. There are elements of cultivation and levels and kingdom building, and everything is stretched to a massive scale concerning an entire realm. If you like horror elements, the story follows the protagonist as he embarks on various investigations uncovering the truth behind supernatural incidents. There are moments in this novel which would resonate strong...</p>
