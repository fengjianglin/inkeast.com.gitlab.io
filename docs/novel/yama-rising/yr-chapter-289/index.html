 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

        })();
    </script> 
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis sighed softly and looked at Qin Ye.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">There’s no mistake… His cowardly personality that rears its ugly head at the earliest sign of trouble has already dwindled substantially. But I suppose that only stands to reason. After all, Emissaries of Hell deal with a plethora of supernatural incidents all the time, none of which are matters that one can truly escape from. Furthermore, a good number of these incidents are matters of life and death. As time wears on, even the most cowardly hermits would soon come to terms with the fact that there’s no reason to run or hide any longer.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Habits become second nature over time.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, it is only when Qin Ye discovers that there is no room for escape that he begins to gleam like a precious gemstone, shedding its thick encasement of dirt to reveal its sparkling clarity within.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His ability to react to exigencies and his masterful grasp over the human heart are both qualities that a top-politician should possess.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Granny Meng… You’ve truly got a good eye for hidden talent…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Arthis sighed inwardly and closed her mouth.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oda Nobunaga’s eyes gleamed brightly. His initial thought had merely been to arm his troops. After all, this was the only way he could develop his troops further to put them on par with the armies of the Nipponese underworld. In other words, it hadn’t even occurred to him that the old Hell could be used as a proving ground for training!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Arm Yin soldiers with the carapace of blight vermin, and then use them to wipe out more blight vermin. It’s a virtuous cycle! We wouldn’t even need half a year… Two months would be more than sufficient to develop a battalion of elite soldiers!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And that’s not all.” Qin Ye placed his hands behind his back and spoke with an air befitting of a future King Yanluo. He smiled faintly, “Let me ask you, what do you call it when an ordinary Yin spirit is equipped with a full set of blight vermin carapace?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis thought for a moment, and then responded with uncertainty, “Skins?”<span id="footnote-ref-974e"><a href="#footnote-974e">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, she promptly heard the sound of cracking knuckles coming from Qin Ye’s hands, accompanied only by a menacing gaze.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What’s the meaning of this?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Do you even know what you’re saying right now? Huh? Do you? If not, can you have the self-restraint not to respond altogether? Would you die if you didn’t speak for a moment?!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Cough… I’m sorry… It’s a force of habit… please continue…” Arthis coughed dryly.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye withdrew his frigid gaze and declared with a sonorous voice, “It’s called the establishment of the Yin artifact manufacturing industry!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he said that, both Oda Nobunaga and Arthis looked up with a bright gleam in their eyes with great surprise.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Both of them once used to be rulers in their own rights, and they naturally understood what benefits the establishment of a brand new industry would bring to the nascent Hell! How many jobs would something like that create for them?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“With this many blight vermin around…” Oda Nobunaga’s eyes blazed brightly as he drew a deep breath and looked at the distant Fengdu Necropolis, “If we can equip the first batch of troops quickly enough… we might even be able to seize millions… no, perhaps even tens of millions pieces of carapace! The industry could last for years on end!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No-no-no. There’s more, there’s more.” Qin Ye wagged his finger as he continued to explain, “Most importantly, this would constitute a special product of Hell. Do you understand what that means?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He looked at Arthis. She looked back vacantly at him, before suddenly gasping in shock.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re… looking to sell skins?” Her voice rose substantially, “This would be the first set of skins produced by the new Hell! The artwork must be perfect, and the workmanship has to be exquisite! First-timers can even earn… Cough, cough… What I mean is that you can use it as a bargaining chip at the imperial court meeting with the feudal officials at the end of the year!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye glared at Arthis as though she were the devil’s incarnation, forcibly breaking the curse of skins that had been plaguing the gamer girl and enabling her to complete her statement with a proper tone of voice.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye heaved a sigh of relief, and he finally let go of the slight measure of reluctance and regret in his heart.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What’s one of the most terrible things that could possibly happen in the world?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would have to be the passing of a person who was unable to enjoy his wealth.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What could be more tragic than that?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would be where the money remained unspent, and his biological child wasn't able to inherit his wealth!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Was there anything worse than that?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It had to be the situation where the child was entitled to inherit his father’s wealth, only to discover that his father had only willed him a sliver of it worth no more than a hundred dollars!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Either keep me completely oblivious to your wealth, or just give everything to me! Isn’t it adding insult to injury that you would give me a 100 dollars out of your fortune worth a hundred million?!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unfortunately, Qin Ye was in that exact situation with the old Hell right now.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After all, Hell’s legacy was definitely not localized to the few places that they had been to. How much had they managed to grab? One of the most painful and traumatic experiences in life was to be able to see a low-hanging, delectable fruit yet be unable to even reach for it! That said, having taken a second glance at it, he discovered that there were still means available for his exploration.</span></p>
 <p style><span>“There are no lousy heroes - only lousy players.” He uttered the oft-cited maxim with great emotion as he swept an arrogant gaze past Arthis. It was clear what he meant underneath the facade of his words - </span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Trash, look at how the expert would handle the game on Hell-difficulty settings. Has any other underworld thought to approach the start of the game this way over the last thousands of years? I don’t think so. Watch, and learn.</span></p>
 <p style><span>Arthis immediately understood what Qin Ye’s lofty gaze meant. She rolled her eyes back at him and suppressed the surging murderous intent in her heart - </span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Endure… must… endure… We won’t have anyone to take charge of the revivification of Hell if I kill him… I’ll just have to endure this for a few hundred years longer… Speaking of which, why does the third King Yanluo of Hell give off such a different vibe than his two predecessors anyway? Crowdsourcing ideas - please help.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, esteemed Lord Yanluo, shall I begin with the preparations?” A calm voice interrupted Qin Ye’s thoughts, causing him to snap out of his great fantasies. He turned to look at the man who had just spoken, and the smile on his face was promptly replaced with a grave expression, “Lord Nobunaga, are you certain?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once you board this ship, there’s no turning back.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">That’s right… THIS is the greatest haul from this trip!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He could always establish his own path even if there wasn’t any legacy of Hell to speak of. The new Hell would develop its own set of cultural identity like the old Hell over time, and it would have its own unique flair to it. That said, having a decorated general to assist him at the start of this Hell-difficulty game was no different from inheriting the full extent of Hell’s legacy.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oda Nobunaga… had finally taken the step to pledge his loyalty.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ever since they first arrived in the old Hell, Oda Nobunaga had been ostensibly silent about the elephant in the room. And whenever he spoke, he would speak respectfully, albeit in his capacity as a lesser regent. But now, it was obvious that Oda Nobunaga had always recognized Qin Ye’s stature as that of a Kanpaku, or an effective ruler of Hell<span id="footnote-ref-7c53"><a href="#footnote-7c53">[2]</a></span>.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oda Nobunaga didn’t respond immediately. Instead, he simply gazed deeply into the vast reaches of Hell for a long time, before he finally gently, but cautiously nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Good!” Qin Ye drew a deep breath, and a black lustre glowed from his chest. Hell’s Records flew out and landed in his hand. He made a grabbing motion with his other hand, and a brush immediately appeared. Then, he wrote down four characters.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">General Zhenyuan!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But just as Qin Ye began to pen down Oda Nobunaga’s name, he suddenly felt as though an invisible force were obstructing his efforts to do so altogether. No matter how hard he tried, he was unable to get around it.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is because you’re only an Anitya Hellguard right now. Given that Oda Nobunaga is also a Hellguard, you don’t possess the rights to confer such an appointment on him.” Arthis muttered softly, “Bite the tip of your finger and wipe your blood across the palm of my hand. I’ll do it.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">I’ve got to bite the tip of my finger again?</span></p>
 <p style><span>Qin Ye stared at Arthis as though he had just seen a ghost - </span><span style="font-style: italic">Haven’t I already told you more than a dozen chapters ago that I can still fight if there’s a knife in my body, but I’ll equally still scream and shout like a little girl when the nurse draws blood from me during a routine examination at the hospital? I mean… whose fault is it that you’re asking me to bite my tongue or bite my fingertips all the time? Do you have a vendetta against tongues and fingertips in particular?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She caught sight of Qin Ye’s gaze, and immediately knew that she was currently facing the aspect of Qin Ye that she couldn’t wait to murder. Fortunately, she had already grown well-accustomed to dealing with the unambitious, pathetic side of the third King Yanluo of Hell. Thus, she stiffly picked up Qin Ye’s hand, swiftly cut a gash across his fingertip, and then grabbed that finger and began to draw on the palm of her own hand.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Whoosh…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;As soon as the talisman diagram on the palm of her hand was completed, the entire space around them trembled softly. Arthis’ right hand suddenly erupted with innumerable wisps of boundless Yin energy that rose high into the sky like a blazing inferno that was dozens of meters tall. Her hair and her clothes instantly began to flutter wildly.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Only Emissaries in the realm of Infernal Judge and beyond are entitled to hold administrative rights under the system of the old Hell…” Hell’s Records blossomed with a white lustre that echoed the Yin energy pouring out of her right hand, “This is the true form of Hell’s Records. Watch and learn.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as the first stroke of the brush landed in Hell’s Records, Oda Nobunaga’s entire body trembled, and the space around him instantly began to clatter violently. Copious amounts of Yin energy lingered about him, while innumerable spots of netherflames surrounded him.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My lord…” Murai Sadakatsu cried out in dismay, but he soon found himself in the exact same predicament.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What they didn’t realize was that in that very same instant, Nohime, Oda Nobunaga’s closest aides, as well as the remaining thousand or so Umamawari horse guards all found themselves experiencing the exact same circumstances!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A violent nethergale swept around them like a tornado of Yin energy. Arthis immediately called out to them, “Do not resist it! Your names are being etched into Hell’s Records. Henceforth, you shall be considered genuine Emissaries of Hell, and you shall be imbued with the strength and authority to annihilate all Yin spirits under Hell’s jurisdiction!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Whoosh!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The brush continued to paint calligraphic strokes, and Oda Nobunaga’s full name was etched into Hell’s Records in no time. As soon as that was completed, a strand of golden soulfire flew out from Oda Nobunaga’s forehead and landed onto Hell’s Records, instantly igniting his name with a faint golden netherflame.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Boom!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Moments later, the nethergale instantly wrapped itself tightly around Oda Nobunaga, transforming into a two-meter tall cocoon of Yin energy, where it continued to swirl slowly about him for some time. A few minutes later, the Yin energy cocoon erupted. Oda Nobunaga stood right where the cocoon had been just moments ago, completely stunned at the changes to his body.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Nipponese armor had vanished without a trace, and it was now instead replaced by an ancient Cathayan armor. He wore a full platemail over his body, while the buckle of his belt was etched with the face of a golden beast. He was further protected by two copper mirrors over the front and back of his body. An embroidered scarlet robe replete with a green velvet tie peeked out of his armor. He carried an identity token around his waist. The words “General Zhenyuan” were inscribed on the front, while the words “Oda Nobunaga” were etched clearly on the back.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If not for the Yin energy that was billowing out of his seven apertures, as well as the blazing netherflames in his eyes, he would undoubtedly have been the embodiment of the word “majesty”.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Hell’s first general… Who would’ve thought that it would be a Nipponese to boot?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Qin Ye chuckled helplessly. It couldn’t be helped. Talent was something that he desperately needed right now. That was the privilege he was willing to extend only to the very first general in Hell. If other foreigners came along right now, he would most certainly make them work for their title.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Are my eyes playing tricks on me?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Qin Ye got the feeling that ever since being conferred the title of General Zhenyuan, his entire being appeared to be… emanating far more Yin energy than before.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As though sensing the bewilderment in Qin Ye’s gaze, Arthis promptly explained, “This is only natural. All Yin spirits must have a place of anchor. Otherwise, they would be no different from drifters. He couldn’t be considered a part of any underworld in the past because the Nipponese weren’t willing to extend that courtesy to him. That was why the Yin energy from his body was naturally weaker back then. But now… I daresay that his strength has increased by at least 20%.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oda Nobunaga scanned his new body and clenched his fists tightly. Seconds later, he cupped his hands respectfully to Qin Ye, “General Zhenyuan, Oda Nobunaga, humbly greets King Yanluo!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Murai Sadakatsu stood right behind Oda Nobunaga in his new Cathayan armor. With a loud thud, he knelt to the ground and declared at the top of his voice, “My life belongs to Hell!!” </span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And he wasn’t the only one. Back at the Honnoji quasi-realm, Nohime also found herself dressed in a brand new set of Cathayan women’s clothing, and she promptly knelt down and cried out, “Congratulations, Lord Nobunaga, for finding a new master. Nohime… is willing to die for Hell!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Right behind her, a thousand or so Umamawari horse guards knelt down in unison and looked to the sky, where they promptly bellowed with a thunderous roar, “Our lives belong to Hell!!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Henceforth, they were all no longer drifters.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excellent…” Back in the old Hell, Qin Ye shut his eyes and nodded with deep satisfaction, “Don’t worry, the Cathayan underworld will see to it that your dreams are fulfilled.”</span></p>
 <p style><span>“Believe me. You’ll personally witness our march into Amano-Iwato within a hundred years’ time!”</span></p>
