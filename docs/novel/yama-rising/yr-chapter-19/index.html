After all, Hyatt was not a large corporation to begin with. Right this moment, the corridor leading up from the third to the fourth floor of the building was packed with over ten spirits that were drifting about, completely obstructing their access to the next floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this your undead army?” Qin Ye furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...Of course not, my troops are currently in Northre-… Hang on, why do I even have to answer such a stupid question of yours in the first place?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye noticed that Arthis’ disposition had somewhat changed. He had the urge to ask her what was responsible for turning a former high-level bureaucrat into someone less imposing than a little bird. Where was all her nobility and frigid charisma?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“These are familiar spirits.” Arthis explained with some measure of bewilderment, “It’s strange to see things like familiar spirits here. Have you heard of a saying, familiar to a tiger?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The saying speaks exactly of familiar spirits. Legend has it that a tiger would transform any human it devours into a familiar spirit of its own and use that to lure and draw in other travelers to the tiger’s den. Why would something like that appear here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye furrowed his brows, “That’s not the point. What I want to know is just how strong these familiar spirits are.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Very weak. They practically have no offensive abilities at all. These familiars can create some illusions at best.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as she finished her explanation, Qin Ye shot forward like an arrow loosened from a bow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arthis’ lips twitched slightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was still gripping the hilt of his saber nervously when the familiar spirits’ abilities were yet unknown to him. But as soon as he discovered that these spirits don’t possess offensive abilities at all, he immediately shot forward like a horse with a fire lit up its ass. What kind of a person is this…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shiiiing!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Dazzling light shone wherever Qin Ye’s saber went. The demon’s head on his saber ignited with a gloomy flame, devouring soul after soul as they were cut down. Wherever the saber’s light went, the souls melted as rapidly as the snow melts in the warm spring sun. Waves of routed Yin energy surged towards him like tidal waves, only to be scattered by a simple cry on his part. Then, after one last flourish of his saber, the lingering Yin energy finally dispersed to the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The revivification of Hell was finally underway. An Emissary of Hell had been dispatched, and the weak drifting spirits had encountered their natural predators.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Tsss…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The corridor linking the third and fourth floors finally opened up. Qin Ye charged up immediately.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entrance to the fourth floor of the building was a complete mess, as though someone had earlier been ransacking the place. The originally orderly office desks had all been knocked on their sides or overturned; computer accessories were scattered everywhere, and even the lights had all been shattered. As soon as Qin Ye made it up to the fourth floor, the doors and windows to the corridor were immediately snapped shut at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A crackle of thunder struck the window outside, causing everything to turn greenish-white momentarily. Qin Ye’s hands were still wrapped tightly around the hilt of his saber. He could tell that there was an existence on this floor of the building whose level of Yin energy was on a completely different scale than the familiar spirits. But he was uncertain just how much stronger this entity was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was probably still weaker than him, but it would nevertheless be wise to treat this opponent seriously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This must be where That Amorous Affair’s true body is!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So soon?” He muttered softly as he glanced vigilantly at his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arthis was similarly puzzled, “To be honest, there’s nothing wrong with her appearing already. She’s only just come into contact with the shard of King Yanluo’s Seal a few days ago, and it’s evident she hasn’t mastered its use yet. How many tricks do you think a piece of trash like her would have up her sleeves? That said… she was still able to capture Sledgehammer Wang in broad daylight, so the full extent of her abilities should still be hidden for now. At the very least, there’s no reason for her to reveal the full extent of her might at the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Drip…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Just then, Qin Ye felt an icy cold sensation on his neck. He touched it. It was blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ice cold blood. Coming from just above his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Urgh….uuuurrrrrgghhh…” A peculiar noise that was mechanically intermittent came from the ceiling just overhead. Despite the windows and doors on the fourth floor being completely shut, a chilling wind of Yin energy had begun to blow, causing Qin Ye’s Hell’s Emissary robes to flutter wildly. Simultaneously, the demonhead saber sliced through the air, drawing a magnificent radiant arc of light in the air.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BANG!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a muffled sound, Qin Ye retreated two meters. A crackle of lightning flashed once more, and Qin Ye finally managed to catch a glimpse of the true face of the ghost on the ceiling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is…” Even though he was already mentally prepared, he still couldn’t help gasping in shock.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even Arthis was taken aback, and it took her some time before she could remark, “So that’s how it is… I finally get it…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ghost wasn’t even in human form.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ghosts generally maintain the appearances of its physical form just prior to death, regardless of their class or circumstances. Yet, That Amorous Affair did not.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Instead, she possessed an almost ethereal body. Her face was incomparably pale, as though it was completely devoid of blood. Her dishevelled hair hung loose, somewhat obscuring the demonically bloodshot eyes of hers. Her gaping wide mouth was filled with vicious, gnarly fangs, all of which were ink-black in colour.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She wore a black dress. Her body was as twisted and contorted as humanly possible. Yet, beneath that dress… was the lower half of a tiger’s body!</span></p>

Then, as soon as they perceived that they had been made use of, and their intelligence had been insulted, they doubled down on their abusive words and launched intense mud-slinging attacks on the one whom they were trying to help in the first place! It was their curses and marrow-piercing insults, and the immense tidal wave of humiliating words and threats that cut deep into her body and turned her into what she was today!</span></p>

There are rules to all things. Since you’ve committed the crime of murder, you’ll naturally be subjected to the commensurate punishment. Submit to me, and you may be granted mercy from the immeasurable suffering you might otherwise face. You… do you understand what I’m saying?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re courting death!!” Since it was too late to take evasive measures, there was no point in attempting such trivialities altogether. With a battle cry of his own, the demonhead saber in his hand trembled. His clothes fluttered on its own, while the veins of his arm grabbing tightly to the hilt of the saber bulged violently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">BAM!!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The Yin energy in his surroundings began to rush madly towards him. In an instant, the convergence of Yin energy transformed into a several-meter-large cyclone that raged from his feet! Just as the apparition arrived in front of him, the demonhead saber in Qin Ye’s hands finally shifted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was slow, so slow that it appeared to be completely motionless. But, this was a mere optical illusion that had only occurred because his actual movements were so quick that the naked eye was unable to track his movements. Thus, it simply appeared as though nothing had shifted at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Time seemed to freeze in that instant. The apparition’s dress and hair fluttered wildly before falling down again. Her bloodshot eyes were still gazing menacingly at Qin Ye. Then, the sound of a saber being sheathed finally broke the oppressive silence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clink.</span></p>

Then, with a loud whoosh, her ethereal body was scattered by a powerful gust of winds, reducing her to nothing more than several spots of green light that continued to hover about and linger in mid-air. The safe which she had been clinging tightly to finally fell to the ground, and the door to the safe was knocked open.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">CRASH!!</span></p>

A sphere of minute slash marks expanded out in all directions, etching themselves into the walls and ceiling of the building. Qin Ye stood tall at the center of it all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m a person who never does anything he’s not certain of.” Qin Ye breathed out a long sigh of relief. Simultaneously, his proof of identity as an Emissary of Hell flew up from his bosom, and a line of writing was mysteriously added to its records.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Granted deliverance to one vengeful apparition; maximum of 20 merit points granted.”</span></p>

Then, he did a double take at the records.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No… There’s a problem!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Granted deliverance?” Having also noticed the same issue, Arthis exclaimed, “That’s not right… Hell is incredibly strict about it’s ranks and forms. And the merit system, which is the foundation that the rank system is built upon, is even stricter! After all, there are only a few billions of people in the mortal realm. But I’m afraid that the number of souls that have accumulated in Hell over time is well beyond this number.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Therefore, ‘expunging’ a ghost and granting ‘deliverance’ upon a ghost are completely different things. There is no way that the merit system will mix these up.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She continued, “Expunging is when an evil ghost refuses to submit and ends up being destroyed by an official of Hell so that it would no longer do any harm to the world. Granting deliverance is quite something else altogether. Deliverance is when an evil ghost submits to conversion, and the Emissary of Hell has also fulfilled the ghost’s dying wishes. In other words, the merit system only grants more points to the Emissary when it detects that the evil ghost no longer has any lingering regrets or attachments.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye nodded his head. In other words, this was essentially the difference between surrendering and being arrested. The one who was arrested might go on to exact vengeance on society in future; but the one who surrendered had essentially done so out of contriteness and turned over a new leaf.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His situation was clearly the former. He had just killed the apparition, so why was it accorded to him as having granted deliverance upon her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Moreover, the apparition had clearly exhibited a hostile intent towards him, so how did he manage to grant deliverance upon her so easily?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After pondering for a long time, he finally spoke again, “You’d earlier mentioned that resolving the source of a ghost’s obsession bestows true deliverance upon them. And this is an undergirding principle that is applicable to all ghosts.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as he finished speaking, both he and Arthis immediately turned to look at the now-opened safe. This was an ordinary safe. The door had incidentally been split open by Qin Ye’s earlier attack. Yet, he could tell that the safe was otherwise covered in claw marks as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But, those claw marks were not those of an animal’s. The claw marks were slender… almost as though they were caused by a woman’s nails when she dug and scratched at the surface of the safe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The only other thing that I might have done was to unintentionally cleave open this safe. In other words, her object of obsession might very well lay in the contents of this safe. Something of vital importance is hidden inside. Even after death, she had time and time again attempted to open it, but to no avail.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Safe to say, this&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">is</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;her source of obsession.”</span></p>

  <p style="text-align: left">1. The mandarin words here are 三人成虎, an idiom which essentially means that rumours become facts when repeated sufficiently. It’s a play on words, because 虎 also means tiger; the original story came from a wise minister who was worried that in his absence, the Emperor would believe lies about him from his political enemies. He asked the Emperor, 'would you believe it if one of your ministers told you that there was a tiger roaming the city?' The Emperor replied, 'Of course not!' &nbsp;The wise minister then asked, 'What if three of them told you the same thing?' The Emperor hesitated then said, 'Well, perhaps.' The wise minister nodded and said, 'Thus, three men can create a tiger.' &nbsp;Hence this is now a Chinese idiom that if untruths are repeated enough time, people will begin to believe them no matter how ridiculous they sound. &nbsp;It's surprisingly apropos given what's going on in the world these days, but we digress. <a href="#footnote-ref-4d2d"><i class="far fa-hand-point-left"></i></a></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yama Rising is finally hitting the shelves! I'm absolutely stoked about this novel simply because of its sheer magnitude and epic proportions. There are elements of cultivation and levels and kingdom building, and everything is stretched to a massive scale concerning an entire realm. If you like horror elements, the story follows the protagonist as he embarks on various investigations uncovering the truth behind supernatural incidents. There are moments in this novel which would resonate strong...</p>
