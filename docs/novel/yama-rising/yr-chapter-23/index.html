He saw the familiar Clear Creek County, the highways extending out of it, and then the vast plains in the suburbs… His perspective followed the winding highways leading out until a miniscule toll booth fell into view. A large word was engraved on it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rivergorge.</span></p>

This was the toll booth belonging to Rivergorge City!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the vision hadn’t stopped moving. In fact, it was still rapidly shifting, travelling deeper and deeper into the city, through the downtown district, into the suburbs, before finally stopping in front of a monstrosity of a compound.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was gloomy and stifling.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ten meter high steel-grey walls stood around the perimeter of the compound. Oppressive, bright searchlights installed above the walls continued to shift around vigilantly. Traces of an electric fence could be seen in the shadows as well. The oppressive aura about this building made it appear like a monster prowling about at night.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is…" Qin Ye pressed hard on his temples. Innumerable traces of blood stains had been left on the walls, while countless men could be heard moaning and groaning from the other end of the compound. His god's view zoomed in on the compound. Within moments, he began to notice some gritty details, including iron handles covered in rust, and blacked, weathered stairs… Then, in the very next moment, a pair of blood-red eyes opened widely, staring straight through the walls and right at him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye saw him as well.</span></p>

However, just like gladiators, each of their auras had already been etched and imprinted on the other's hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Why didn't you tell me that as long as I'm holding onto the shard of King Yanluo’s Seal, the owner of the next shard would immediately be able to see me?" Qin Ye gnashed his teeth at the soul sphere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That's right. Even though it had been mere seconds' worth of direct confrontation, he immediately knew exactly what it meant.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The endless cycles had just begun their rotations. And the end game was that only the one who managed to secure all of the shards of King Yanluo’s Seal would be able to live on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Must've slipped my mind." Arthis responded with insincerity, "In any event, holding onto the shard is the only way to leave this place. Or would you like to also dispose of the four men waiting for you outside?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye revealed a wry smile as he massaged his temples, "And I finally thought that I could begin to trust you as well."</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arthis murmured, "Is that so...such a pity…"</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">CRASH!!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four men surrounding the building were immediately taken aback. To their eyes, the glass panels had exploded into millions of fragments, while a man wearing a long black robe shot straight out of the building like an owl at night. He wore a tall, pointy cap with the words "</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">world peace</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">" written on them. His face was almost ghastly pale…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"This is…" The four men paused for a moment before exclaiming in unison, "An Anitya Hellguard of Black and White?!"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">None of them bothered holding onto their umbrellas at this moment, and each of their four umbrellas were swept into the heart of the pouring rain. Simultaneously, the rain around the four people began to contort slightly as well. What should have landed on their bodies instead skirted around them as though they were boats coursing through a body of water. At the same time, their clothes began to flutter about without wind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, the mysterious man hardly waited for the four cultivators to make their move. In fact, he didn't even pause for a single moment. Instead...he simply soared into the sky just like a goshawk!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh!&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four men who had been poised for battle were instantly petrified. The mysterious figure quickly soared past them. Seconds later, as they slowly recovered from their astonishment, they continued to stare at the sky with abject disbelief.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Rumble!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A bolt of lightning shot across the sky, yet any traces of that mysterious figure was long gone by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Nobody spoke a word.</span></p>

Instead, they splattered all over their faces. Yet, almost as though they hasn't realized that much, the four men continued to gaze into the distant night sky where Qin Ye had shot towards.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Flew…" Several moments later, one of the men dressed in suits finally opened his mouth with trembling, "Flew? He really flew? Was I mistaken?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"No…" The man who had first been tracking down Qin Ye, AC-285, also spoke with a shaky voice. His hands were trembling as though he had just seen a ghost, and he shook his head with resignation, "He's really taken flight...he really has…"</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yama Rising is finally hitting the shelves! I'm absolutely stoked about this novel simply because of its sheer magnitude and epic proportions. There are elements of cultivation and levels and kingdom building, and everything is stretched to a massive scale concerning an entire realm. If you like horror elements, the story follows the protagonist as he embarks on various investigations uncovering the truth behind supernatural incidents. There are moments in this novel which would resonate strong...</p>
