 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p> 
 <p> <a href="/announcement/2021-roadmap-site-redesign-karma-changes-ebooks-more">Read More...</a> </p>

        (function() {
            if (window.localStorage) {
                var fontSize = parseFloat(localStorage.getItem('fontsize'));

                if (!isNaN(fontSize)) {
                    document.getElementById("chapter-content").style.fontSize = fontSize + "px";

        })();
    </script> 
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis chuckled coldly, “Sure, your harem can include the girls with nice smiles, ice queens, and intelligent girls, but… why haven’t you considered asking me along either? Instead, one single look at a female ghost that is barely eye catching, and you immediately harbour thoughts of letting her into your harem. On the other hand, you’ve had such a national beauty queen living by your side for the past few months, yet you’ve completely turned a blind eye to my existence just like that?!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye was completely speechless. Finally, he tossed his hands into the air and conceded, “Alright… then esteemed national beauty queen, revered Arakshasa, are you willing to be a part of the new King Yanluo’s harem? In exchange, you’ll be bestowed a nanny and a plot land of five square kilometers as part of the betrothal gift…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get lost.” Arthis barked back before he could even finish speaking. The paper crane even pointed one of her tiny wings straight towards the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">That’s right.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">That’s the feeling.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">The script is now back on track.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye’s expressions contorted slightly, “Wait… if you’ve been reluctant all this while, then why did you have to ask such things of me in the first place?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The paper crane languidly preened her wings with her beak, “You don’t understand, this has to do with a woman’s pride.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Ahh… women…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me.” Just then, a charming voice with a beautiful ring to it echoed softly, “Are you… an Emissary of Hell?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The duo turned their heads in unison and saw that the Yin spirit had already opened her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span>She curtseyed softly like a beautiful golden lotus, and then sashayed before Qin Ye with a soothing smile on her face, “I died in the Republic of Cathay era<span id="footnote-ref-5fd5"><a href="#footnote-5fd5">[1]</a></span>. May I know… what era it is now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s…” Qin Ye was just about to answer when his face suddenly froze in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He looked down stiffly like a machine, only to notice that a hand had found its way between his legs, where his unnameable parts were located!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a pale-looking hand of a Yin spirit.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Bloody hell… this… this opening statement… is something that I’d never expected…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Yin spirit recoiled with a slight shock with her first grasp. She looked at Qin Ye, turned her attention back to her own hand, and then smiled sweetly, “Dear me… I couldn’t tell at all… you truly are well-endowed…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye wrested himself free from the female ghost’s grasp. He wasn’t ashamed. After all, the concept of shame was something that was far too foreign to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was simply cold…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was truly cold… What should have thoroughly ignited his passion had instead caused him to shrink back due to the icy ghost’s hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Why… why is it that all the men around me are more good-looking than the other, whether the pretty boy, Classmate Wang Chenghao, or that stupid buffoon, Comrade Lin Han… And why can’t the women around me be any more normal than the others? It’s either Arthis and her long tongue that hangs to the ground, or this Republic of Cathay lady who would freeze his appendage at the slightest touch…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">If… if things continue like that… I might not be able to keep the door open any longer…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The room was suddenly filled with an awkward silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The female ghost looked mischievously at her illusory hand, as though enjoying the lingering feeling of warmth on it. Her brows were sharp and striking, and incredibly seductive. She glanced at Qin Ye with her peach blossom eyes, sending waves of electricity shooting through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye hadn’t seen such an unreserved woman for a long time now. Life in the mortal realm had been tough for him, and he even had to do all he could to hide his presence and remain invisible to the rest of the world. In short, it was the first time he had encountered such a passionate and fiery yet fleeting and freezing moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And it was also slightly embarrassing…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In that instant, the man and the ghost stared at each other without a single word.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“About that… what should I do now?” He coughed dryly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ask her about her background.” Arthis responded languidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But before he could even ask his question, the female ghost suddenly stared at the paper crane in disbelief, and she collapsed to her knees as her entire body trembled violently.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Esteemed heavenly officer, please pardon my ignorance. I wasn’t aware that there was another esteemed presence in the room. Please forgive my callous disposition earlier.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Ye stared at her in disbelief -&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">What’s that supposed to mean? So, you can flirt with me just because of my big lump?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">I’m warning you, don’t you dare act inappropriately with Soul Hunters!</span></p>
 <p><span>“Mm.” Arthis responded casually as she flapped her wings at Qin Ye. Her intentions were obvious -&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Go on, then? Do you expect me to do everything? You’re a village chief! Can’t you display a commensurate amount of initiative and self-consciousness?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">I’ll endure this…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Qin Ye drew a deep breath, took two steps forward. Then with a light cough and a simple fist-and-palm salute, “Milady…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bloody hell!!” Arthis flew up and slapped him with a wing as she barked resentfully, “Tch… men. Move aside!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye slipped to the side obsequiously.</span></p>
 <p><span>This wasn’t entirely Qin Ye’s fault. After all, he had been brought up with an eye for quality. This… this was simply the natural reaction of a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cicerone of the Great Demons having seen an exquisite beauty…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The female ghost cowered with fear and lowered her head as Arthis’ tiny body flew up into the air. Seconds later, Arthis asked condescendingly, “You must have seen other Emissaries of Hell before. That’s good. We can cut to the chase then. Introduce yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes… My name is Su Dongxue, and I was born in November 1930. Before I died…” She bit her lower lips lightly, revealing a pitiful expression on her face, “I was a singer at a brothel…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be more specific.” Arthis interjected impatiently, “What brothel? A bordello, a pleasure quarters, or a strip club? Or a call house? Or…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She smirked and glanced at Qin Ye, “A whorehouse?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Dongxue lowered her head even more. After hesitating for several seconds, she finally responded, “A strip club.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Arthis looked at Qin Ye with a meaningful expression, almost as though she were saying -&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Do you understand now? I’m still the most exquisite one here.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... What’s that?” Qin Ye asked with some measure of disappointment.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis explained elegantly, “A bordello isn’t the same as a typical brothel. The ladies there only sell their crafts, and not their bodies. Bordellos are usually located in exquisite courtyard houses or western-style garden houses with restricted entry to its premises. The owners to these places are usually comparable to the rich and powerful aristocrats of their time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The second grade brothels are a little less extravagant and exquisite, but they are still relatively exclusive areas. These are called pleasure quarters. Most of the workers there don’t sell their bodies. The third grade ones are called brothels. They are a little more humble than the pleasure quarters. When it comes to these places…” She drawled meaningfully, “You can say that the workers no longer own their own bodies… What’s the matter with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye clutched at his heart as he revealed a pained expression on his face, “Nothing… please continue…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Dongxue was so beautiful that she would easily shoot to stardom as a goddess in any entertainment circle. She was even all natural, and there was simply no room for critique or allegations that she was plastic. That said, the pristine image of his goddess had suddenly been shattered by the news that she had shared her bed with thousands of men who knew her inside out…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye felt extremely bitter!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Hehe… you dare mess with me?</span><span>&nbsp;Arthis swept Qin Ye a victorious glance.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">I know exactly what you Cicerone of the Great Demons sorts are like, and just how to deal with you guys. As time passes, there will invariably be far more beauties in Hell than in the mortal realm. As a future Yama-King, the first thing you’ll have to learn is to have control over your own belt…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Many years later, Qin Ye sits majestically on the throne of King Yanluo, while a group of beautiful concubines below bow daintily and respectfully, “Blessings to King Yanluo.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A woman in a magnificent dress lifts the gilded golden armor from Qin Ye’s body, “Sisters, even though we’re all considered family now, this doesn’t change the fact that we should still work hard to birth a royal heir to the throne. This way, we can continue to share in each others’ blessings, and Fengdu can continue to grow from strength to strength. Sister Ba has just arrived today, so lets have her stay in the Chamber of Everlasting Ecstasy tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Should we go on to understand the nature of the frolics in the Fengdu harem?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">No… We have to stem the flow of such momentum as soon as it begins. The Cicerone of the Great Demons is already showing signs of losing control of his own belt…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Arthis cleared her throat as she continued, “The fourth grade ones are even worse, and are generally targeted at blue-collared, salaried workers. These are called call houses. As to whorehouses…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She smiled faintly, “These are basically illegal prostitutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now that the veil to the goddess’ appearances had been completely rent apart, she finally directed things back to the topic at hand, “How did you die? And how did the circumstances of the Great Intergenerational Heredity arise?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye looked at Su Dongxue expectantly, thinking that he would hear of a tragic love story - one that told of how an exquisite, talented lady was unable to peddle her craft and was forced to perish as a result of the circumstances… and thus she ended up turning into a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This wasn’t a result of him thinking with the brain between his legs. Rather, it was the first time he had seen a normal Yin spirit apart from himself and Arthis. Incidentally, it was also a female Yin spirit - a pie that he could consider dipping his fingers into in future. After all, wouldn’t understanding the women of the future Fengdu Necropolis also be considered a part of his duty?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Besides, if a man saw an incredibly beautiful woman, or if a woman saw an incredibly handsome man, wouldn’t it be a lie if both said that they didn’t harbour any illicit thoughts about their eye candies?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My mistress forbade me to receive guests, but I broke the rules, and even accidentally got pregnant. I was beaten to death in the cathouse.” Unfortunately, her response was like a bolt out of the blue to Qin Ye.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He felt his worldview crumbling, and his mouth twitched uncontrollably as he asked, “Was it because you faced some form of difficulty or other? For instance… you had a lover, and you wished to elope with him, yet your mistress discovered this and thus prevented you from receiving guests… or something along those lines?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Su Dongxue looked up at Qin Ye in astonishment. Even though it was a fleeting look, Qin Ye knew she had just given him the look which said -&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Why do you think there’s such complex drama surrounding everything?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No… It’s just as I’d said.” Su Dongxue no longer pretended to be reserved, and she kowtowed softly, “My body was in good condition. Four or five times a night wasn’t a problem to me. Unfortunately, I’d inadvertently stepped on my mistress’ toes because I’d seized the business of my other sisters.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Ye gazed at the ceiling.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Why is the script of life always always so unpleasant…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis chirped back, “What’s there to be displeased about? Isn’t the money earned at the end of the day the same?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Su Dongxue bowed graciously as her lips twitched, “... Milady… when I get… ecstatic, I often forget to collect money…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">How “ecstatic” do you have to be to forget the collection of fees… can’t you take a little bit more pride in your work?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye could feel his heart wrenching in pain, and he finally waved his hand weakly, “Stop, stop… I understand. Arti, you don’t have to continue this line of questioning. Just tell me where you intend to place her. We can’t just bring her along like that, can we?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having a silicone doll following him around was worrying enough. He didn’t want to be tied down to any more peculiar objects.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why do we need to bring her along?” Arthis asked in surprise, “Do you think that’s all there is to the progenitors of the Great Intergenerational Heredity? They possess another incredible ability. It’s called mimicry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mimicry?” Qin Ye furrowed his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The smile on Arthis’ face faded away as she explained seriously, “That’s right. Yin spirits are formless to begin with. As soon as the Great Intergenerational Heredity is triggered, the host’s body would immediately grow chaotic with the intermingling of Yin energy and Yang energy. Since the Yin spirit has no form to begin with, it is naturally able to take the form of any object or body. You should’ve heard of the saying that water is formless and shapeless.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye nodded his head immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“They can mimic any creature they have ever seen, even Emissaries of Hell. And the scariest part about their mimicry ability is that your appearance isn’t the only thing they can mimic - they can even mimic your energy signature and the realm of your abilities. Naturally, the mimic can only unleash approximately half the amount of strength as the original. But even then, that is more than sufficient for our purposes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye thought for a moment. Several seconds later, he asked, “So, when Li Cheng blocked my attack earlier, was it also because of the mimicry ability?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“That’s right. So where do you think would be the most suitable home for her? Which place needs a powerful Netherworld Operative most right now?”</span></p>
