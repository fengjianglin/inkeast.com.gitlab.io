As he drew closer, he noticed that the lock on the door to the rooftop had already been broken some time ago.</span></p>

As soon as he stepped out, he immediately gasped. Everything on the rooftop was harrowingly white.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wooden shelves were laced with white prayer flags fluttering wildly in the wind.The rest of the scene was decorated with a number of paper horses and paper servants which surrounded three silhouettes that sat silently among them. A dark coffin lay in the center of it all, while the flames of two half-meter tall candles flickered madly in the rain as it continued to emit a dim glow in the surroundings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Despite the torrential downpour, the flames on the candles continued to burn softly.</span></p>

On such a gloomy, rainy night like this, the prayer flags continued to clatter incessantly with the billowing winds, seeming all the more horrific than ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Zemin and his wife were dressed in classic Cathay tunics. Their eyes were closed, and each of them sat on their own chair silently. None of them were breathing. Their skin was cold and as inelastic as ever. Nobody knew how long it had been since they had passed away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Chenghao was passed out on the chair between his deceased parents. He was still breathing, yet Qin Ye chose not to wake him up. After all, some things were best left unknown to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is man-made.” He looked at the mourning hall and declared with confidence, “The manuscript that Granny Meng has left me states that ghosts can’t come into contact with things of the mortal realm. There’s no way they would be able to set up a mourning hall like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not just that…” Arthis chuckled coldly, “Look closely at this coffin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The ink-black coffin was tied up and bound by innumerable blood-red threads. Four bronze oil lamps were carefully placed, one at each corner of the coffin. Each of them were alight with a dim, pea-sized flame.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The Four Stars Soul Summoning Array… the four lamps each represent one of the four baleful heavenly bodies, namely Ketu, Rahu, the Voracious Wolf, and Mars<span id="footnote-ref-dc68"><a href="#footnote-dc68">[1]</a></span>. The red threads are woven from human hair that had been soaked in blood. Seven days later, the evil spirit would return to its body. This technique belongs to the earthly branch of the feng shui secret arts. Damnation… it looks like we’ve underestimated this old ghost. He’s probably already established some form of connection with some exceptional human individuals to achieve all this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye slowly ran his hand along the corner of the coffin. Then, a tiny smile suddenly crept up the corner of his lips. “You still haven’t told me whether I will be discovered by this old ghost or not.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who knows?” Arthis brushed him off, before realization dawned on her, “What are you trying to say? You’ve got a devious smile on your face.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve suddenly thought of a little problem…” Qin Ye lifted the coffin, “Perhaps there might be a way to set my heart at ease… but now’s not the time to discuss that.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arthis didn’t press the issue, because as soon as the coffin’s lid was lifted, an incredibly dense Yin energy surged up from the coffin, instantly converging into a powerful vortex of Yin energy that was invisible to mere mortals!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What lay within the coffin was exactly the corpse of That Amorous Affair. It looked almost completely perfect, with hardly even a trace of her leaping off the building. She was wearing a black dress, just like the one that was shown in the videos. Both of her hands were folded neatly on her bosom. However, right beneath her hands, a crimson stone continued to spew out a boundless amount of Yin energy!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A shard of King Yanluo’s Seal!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shashasha…&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Right this moment, in all of Rivergorge City, two mysterious entities simultaneously turned their gazes in Qin Ye’s direction.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the top of the Green Dragon Mountain Cemetery in Rivergorge City, a muffled, cracking sound could be heard from an ancient tombstone. Seconds later, with an eerie click, a withered hand stretched out of the grave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ahh…” An avaricious voice that sounded as though it had just learned to speak echoed out from the crevice in the grave, “I...I...I hunger…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Somewhere else, on another archaic-looking street, a woman wearing a red dress who was combing her hair in front of a mirror suddenly turned her head around 180 degrees. Drool poured out from her mouth like a waterfall as she gazed at the distant sky.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Clear Creek County.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The eruption of Yin energy lasted no more than a split second. Before these mysterious entities could begin to track down his location, Qin Ye had already waved his long sleeve and drawn the shard of King Yanluo’s Seal into a silken brocade bag that was tied to his arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’ve finally found it…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Even Qin Ye couldn’t help but heave a massive sigh of relief at this moment. However, he didn’t have the luxury of time to inspect the shard to see what exactly it looked like. As soon as he first touched the shard of King Yanluo’s Seal, he immediately experienced a wonderful sensation of balance swelling up within him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yin and Yang were now balanced once again, and the curse of the three-day limit had finally been broken. But before he could even finish heaving that sigh of relief, tens of red dots immediately began hovering about outside the white mourning hall like flies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What’s this?” Arthis looked at the red dots curiously. This was something she was unable to identify despite her wealth of knowledge and experience. Qin Ye, however, only needed one glance at the red dots before he began trembling wildly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course you wouldn’t know… how could a person who’s not kept up with the times know what these things are? In fact, it would be far more peculiar if an old grand-aunt like you could recognize something like this!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Eh? You look terrified. Your hand appears to be shifting. You’re lifting your hands… are you attempting to surrender? Who are you surrendering to?!” Arthis’ last few words were spoken in a shrill, agitated tone of voice.</span></p>

You stupid fool!!”&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The damn things are far more frightening than a Frostmourne Sword. A pull of the trigger is tantamount to a death sentence… do you even know the differences between firearms and normal weapons?</span></p>

Why else do you think they seem to be pointing those lasers about aimlessly?”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything went silent despite the torrential downpour. Over ten red spots continued to linger and hover about the rooftop mourning hall. Then, approximately ten minutes later, four figures finally emerged from the corner of the adjoining street.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each of these four people were dressed in black suits and toted black umbrellas. It was hard to distinguish them one from the other in the dark of the night. That said… each person seemed to emit certain fluctuations of energy from their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cultivators.” Arthis declared with certainty as soon as she spotted them, “But they’re rather weak. Our abilities are built upon Yin energy, while they cultivate using primordial true energy. We walk different paths.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye continued to observe them for several more seconds before sighing wistfully. He was ascertaining with his own two eyes that these were not people he could trifle with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The four people had, at best, just embarked on their path of cultivation. Having sized up the extent of their abilities, he adjudged that he would be able to dispose of all four of them at the same time with no problems at all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That said, their authority was quite something else. They were here as representatives of the mortal realm. In other words, a disposal of one of these agents was hardly any different from issuing a public declaration of war against the mortal realm. With his present abilities, that would be tantamount to a death wish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Greetings, sir.” As soon as they arrived at the building, the four men stopped in unison. One of the four bowed deeply. His voice was not loud. Yet, it still echoed throughout the entire building, “We’re investigators from the National Special Investigations Department, Clear Creek County Branch. My registration number is AC-276.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“AC-265.” “AC-285.” “AC-281.”</span></p>

Since our abilities are too weak to subdue it, we’ve also notified the city district. This ghostly entity is classified as a pseudo-ghast.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But, just a little while ago, we noticed the disappearance of all traces of this pseudo-ghast. Any existence that can expunge pseudo-ghasts on their own are guests of honours of all major departments in the entire province. That said…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He paused for a moment, “We don’t seem to have any records of your registration number.”</span></p>

Or do you come from someplace else altogether? With strength like this… if Senior remains unaffiliated to any other organizations, might we be able to interest you in considering the Special Investigations Department?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Supernatural perimeter?” Qin Ye queried in a hushed voice.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Protective measure?” Qin Ye found such an abstruse concept incredibly difficult to understand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...Perhaps we can put it differently: it’s like how your little ding-dong is protected by a thin layer of protection in order to sequester billions of sperm from their target. But as soon as there is a breach in this protective layer, it could very well mean jackpot. Understand now?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...even though this analogy is rather bizarre...I understand it in mere seconds…”</span></p>

Nobody apart from the persons involved was aware of the fact that there was presently a somewhat fascinating conversation going on at the building. AC-276 continued in all seriousness, "It seems, sir, that you are unwilling to consider our proposal? Then… at the very least, is it possible to meet face to face?"</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">"Senior, as you're probably already aware, the mortal realm is presently experiencing some rapid, massive changes. This could very well be the preamble for something which threatens Cathay’s existence for the very first time.

Naturally, it is only if you join us that you will be granted access to our wealth of resources and obtain first responder reports of any supernatural events." As they continued their spiel, they also discreetly repositioned themselves around the entire building.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye furrowed his brows whilst he continued to lean against the glass, "Do you have any means to allow me to leave this place without leaving any traces behind?"</span></p>

Then, with a flick of his sleeves, the silken brocade opened up, and he quickly wrapped his fingers around the shard of King Yanluo’s Seal. Just then, a massive tremor jolted his mind! The entire world around him began to spin.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boundless Yin energy…</span></p>

Qin Ye felt as though he was a mere drop of water that had fallen into the vast ocean. He felt as though he had caught a glimpse of all eighteen levels of Hell. Then, he felt as though he saw the thousands upon thousands of ghosts traversing the Yellow Springs Road as he flew further and further away into the horizon. Finally, a massive golden pillar of light exploded in front of his eyes, and he noticed that he was suddenly standing right at the feet of the statue of Bodhisattva Ksitigarbha.</span></p>

Multitudes of constellations blanketed the wild plains, and the winding rivers converged into the boundless oceans.</span></p>

After what felt like ages, he suddenly shuddered and came back to his senses. He was already covered in cold sweat.</span></p>

Just then, almost as though it detected a new owner, its boundless Yin energy began to flourish, and it completely enveloped him in just an instant. Several seconds later, he transformed into an emaciated-looking man dressed in black and wearing a tall hat.</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yama Rising is finally hitting the shelves! I'm absolutely stoked about this novel simply because of its sheer magnitude and epic proportions. There are elements of cultivation and levels and kingdom building, and everything is stretched to a massive scale concerning an entire realm. If you like horror elements, the story follows the protagonist as he embarks on various investigations uncovering the truth behind supernatural incidents. There are moments in this novel which would resonate strong...</p>
