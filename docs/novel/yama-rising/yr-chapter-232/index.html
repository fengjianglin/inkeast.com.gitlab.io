 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Light?</span></p>
 <p style><span>He rubbed his eyes - </span><span style="font-style: italic">Did I just see light outside?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The black veil covering the windows was rather thin, so he could vaguely make out what was outside of the carriage through the windows. Under the dark canopy of the night, in the midst of the fields around, there was a spot of light that appeared to be following the train as it chugged along.</span></p>
 <p style><span>The light didn’t appear to be too far away. By his estimations, its distance was approximately a hundred meters. That said, the sudden appearance of a light source triggered his curiosity - </span><span style="font-style: italic">Where does the light come from? How can it possibly keep up with the train’s speed?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;He couldn’t help but take a closer look at it.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The source of light appeared blurry at best, and yet it gave off an unusually familiar sensation. However, Ma Yuankun just couldn’t put a finger on what it was no matter how hard he thought about it. Nevertheless, he operated his true energy and imbued his eyes so that he could get a clearer look at it.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, in the very next second, his pupils shrank, and he abruptly shot to his feet.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Whoosh.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Everyone else in the carriage suddenly looked over. All four carriages of Operative-class experts turned to look at Ma Yuankun, only to notice that his body was twitching uncontrollably and his lips trembling as he pointed outside the window, completely unable to find the words to express the multitude of emotions and thoughts running through his mind.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Enemy…” Ma Yuankun blurted out after several seconds of tense silence. Then, he screamed at the top of his voice, “En-en-enemy attack... ENEMY ATTACK!!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had seen it clearly.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The source of light came from a lantern.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They were presently still travelling through the wilderness, approximately one hundred kilometers away from Eastsea City.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dark clouds filled the sky, obfuscating the soft twinkles of the constellations in the sky. Yet, despite the fact that they were in the middle of nowhere, a spot of light cut right through the stifling darkness of the night and travelled closely alongside the trajectory of the train.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Furthermore, he was able to tell that the entity carrying the lantern was not a human being!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He saw it clearly. That entity… was an arachnid with a woman’s body!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wore a Nipponese mask, and her long, disheveled hair scattered all across her body. What should have been a spider’s body was instead the figure of a lady with several hairy spider legs extending out of her body. She carried a scarlet lantern with her and followed closely alongside the train and it chugged along!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What made matters worse was the fact that she appeared to have noticed Ma Yuankun as soon as he saw her figure. Her head turned a hundred and eighty degrees around stiffly and glared right at him with a horrific posture. And then… she bared her teeth.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her lips extended from ear to ear. Although she was wearing a mask, he could still see her scarlet maw peeking out menacingly from underneath her mask.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as he screamed, the string of coins sequestering each carriage of the train shook with a violent clatter, almost as though out of desperation. Simultaneously, the talismans that were plastered all around the carriage suddenly began to flutter and flap horizontally! And then, the dim lights in the carriage crackled and flickered dangerously!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An evil ghost arrives, terror ensues.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This isn’t something that a mere vengeful apparition can do. The fact that its presence can influence the surroundings means--…” An old man in the front row trembled and shot to his feet. His lips twitched uncontrollably, but he was unable to bring himself to say the word.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">This was at least a hundred-years evil ghost!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you all waiting for?!!” He turned around abruptly and roared at the entire carriage, “To arms! Prepare yourselves!! Or are you waiting for death?!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The furious bellow jolted everyone back to their senses in an instant. In a flash, everyone pulled out their peachwood swords, wealth of the five emperors, copper bells, bagua compasses, and other similar implements, and then swiftly took up formation within the carriage, standing with their backs against each other like they had always practised.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But a hundred-year evil ghost wasn’t something that mere budding Operative-class experts could deal with!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Chug-a-chug-a…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Next to the oppressive silence of the train carriages, the incessant chugging sounds of the train didn’t bring comfort and assurance to their hearts at all. Instead, its repeated chugging even wore away at their tense spirits. Right this moment, they felt no different from prey that had been gagged, bound and strung up over a death god’s dining table as they heard the butcher sharpening his knife in the distance.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The metallic grinding sound of the blade slowly chipped away at their sanity.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Gulp…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Ma Yuankun gulped nervously. He had just breached the bottleneck to become an Operative-class expert, while a hundred-year evil ghost was clearly an opponent that was well above his weight class - these were entities to be left to Soul Hunters. Thus, the prospects of confronting such a powerful existence caused him to break out in cold sweat and shiver all over.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just then, he suddenly noticed that… the landscape outside had changed…</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wasn’t sure when it happened, but he could see that the scenery outside the carriage had completely changed!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And it seemed as though they had at some point in time entered a train station.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was an incredibly ancient-looking station. There were Nipponese words everywhere, and the entire station was in shambles, broken and dilapidated, with chairs tipped over and other equipment and apparatuses strewn all over the floor. It appeared as though nobody had been here in years. The dim light outside flickered unceasingly, filling the atmosphere with a tense ambience.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were even streaks of blood stains all over the station. And the most terrifying part was that there were pale-faced men and women dressed in ancient Nipponese clothing standing on both sides of the platform, silently staring at them with their bloodshot eyes!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were those with a large gash on their throats; those who cradled their heads in their hands; and those who had half a skull missing from their heads, amongst others. They all presented themselves with dark purple spots of livor mortis on their bodies. It was as though this was a parade of the dead to send them off into their afterlife!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bizarre and terrifying sight gave Ma Yuankun the feeling as though the final destination of the train weren’t Eastsea North Station at all. Rather, it was the Yomi-no-Kuni, the yellow springs of the Nipponese underworld.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the dark of the night, a silent train had pulled up into a horrific platform filled with dead people, who were silently sending them into the afterworld.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">T-t-t-t-t…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Ma Yuankun’s teeth were already chattering incessantly. Then, in the next second, the talismans plastered all across the passenger carriages of the train spontaneously combusted, and the strings of copper coins at the entrance to the carriage crumbled in an instant!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Crash!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The copper coins scattered everywhere. And right at that moment, eight large holes were punched straight through the carriage roof! A pale face peered through one of them. The mask on its face didn’t do much to conceal its grotesque maw that was opened wide. And then, it roared with a blood curdling shriek.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yin energy poured out like a raging tide through the rows of ink-black teeth in its maw.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">SSSSSSS!!!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">It’s that arachnid…</span></p>
 <p style><span>Ma Yuankun’s limbs froze up, and it was in this instant that he realized his usual training did nothing to prepare him for something like this - </span><span style="font-style: italic">So that’s what an evil ghost is like… </span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It used the environment and the human psyche to strike terror and fear in their hearts! It was on a completely different level from any of the other ghosts he had practised on in the past!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">But why do I get the feeling that there’s another pair of eyes staring right at us - one that’s even more fearsome than this arachnid?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the platform outside, the parade of the dead had already raised their pale lanterns to illuminate the area with a ghastly glow. Their carriage had derailed off their earlier destination, and they were hurtling towards an abyss of greater terror.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Stand your ground!!” “Immediately inform our seniors!” “Stand your ground! Nobody is to retreat! I’ll kill anyone who retreats!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Several cries of alarm resounded throughout the carriage. But, just then, all the lights in the carriage were extinguished.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The light at the farthest carriage went out abruptly.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone who turned to look at it saw it - the evil ghost had revealed its true form right at the location where the domain of light intersected with the shadows of darkness.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was fully clothed in black garbs, wearing a golden coloured headband as he hung upside down from the roof of the carriage. His body was hunched like a jackal hunting for food. His figure flickered quickly, vanishing and reappearing in different locations.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Click…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Another light went out, and the figure traversed through a carriage in the blink of an eye. It was drawing closer to them!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Click, click, click, click…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The lights went out one by one, and the fearsome figure drew closer and closer! With each light that went out, it shifted closer to them, while they, too, got a closer look at its appearance. The gripping tension and stifling oppression in the area also bore down on them with ever greater intensity!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Click…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Finally, the last light went out. Nobody dared to speak at this moment because the last light was none other than the light that was right over their heads.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Is he… in our carriage right now?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Standing right above their heads, staring down from above at the group of shivering humans as though he were a predator toying with its food.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">T-t-t-t…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The chugging sounds of the train had ceased completely. Everything was now so silent that someone’s chattering teeth could be heard by everyone around.</span></p>
 <p style><span>Ma Yuankun’s hands were wrapped tightly around his peachwood sword - </span><span style="font-style: italic">It’s here… it’s here!</span></p>
 <p style><span>A small voice screamed in his mind - </span><span style="font-style: italic">Run! Run away right now! This Yin spirit is on a completely different level! You’ll die… if you stay here, you’ll definitely die!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he soon realized that when one was overcome with absolute terror, his entire body would refuse to budge, and simply remain frozen and rooted to the ground.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His hair stood erect. It was almost as though he could sense the frigid terror spreading through every single pore and every single cell within his body. The fear of the known was the most terrifying kind of fear! It was almost as though a cold hand were gently caressing his cheek.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No… in fact, there was indeed someone caressing his cheek.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Its hand was cold, and yet it emanated a distinct corpse stench. Just a little while ago, the entity had dropped silently from the roof and was now slowly and gently caressing each person’s face with its cold, frigid fingers.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since time immemorial…” A hoarse voice echoed throughout the carriage, “You’ve been far too haughty and arrogant…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So… it’s time for us to teach you the true meaning of respect…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Remember my name. I’m the captain of the Hojo Clan’s secret ninjas of Renpu, Scarlet 01…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Pssskkk!!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;A second later, blood splattered across the carriage windows, and shrieks and moans cut through the oppressive silence of the night!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">………………………………………………………..</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What are you doing here?” Bai Yishan asked the masked man with a pleasant surprise as the train pulled into the station.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye responded placidly, “Am I not welcome here?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bai Yishan’s entourage included another Soul Hunter and three Operative-class experts. As soon as Qin Ye released a trace of his Hellguard-class energy that was disguised as true energy, everyone around immediately gasped and backed away in shock.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Hellguard?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">A living Hellguard?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Someone like that would be conferred great authority, even if here were part of the Special Investigations Department! How did Master Bai gain such goodwill to be able to invite a Hellguard to lend a hand?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Furthermore… from the looks of his voice and his skin… this man appears to be rather young?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Am I terrifying?” Qin Ye stuffed his hands into his pocket and asked indifferently.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, no, no!” “Sir, please don’t misunderstand us. We’re incredibly grateful that you’ve graced us with your presence!” “That’s right! With you around, this trip is naturally going to go on much more smoothly!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye had always maintained a noble and cold persona in front of outsiders. He glanced indifferently at them, and then suddenly smirked, “Smoothly?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had sensed two violent fluctuations of Yin energy just a moment ago. Furthermore, he could tell that the strength of these Yin energy signatures were stronger than him!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">The secret ninjas of Renpu have made their move...This four centuries old powerful faction have finally made their move.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What do you mean…” Bai Yishan was taken aback, and his voice was trembling slightly. Qin Ye turned around placidly and gazed at the train that was slowly pulling into the station, “There’s probably no one on board left alive right now.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What?!” “How is that possible?!! Who’s the culprit? Who’s made a move? Sir, you must know these as well, don’t you?” “That’s impossible… we’ve even engaged a team of elites… who would possibly dare to make a move against them?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye didn’t respond. He had only sensed a powerful fluctuation of Yin energy earlier, but he didn’t know the specific extent of devastation on board the train.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Tssss!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;With a hiss of the brakes, the train finally entered the station. As more and more carriages pulled into the station, everyone’s expressions of doubt and suspicion soon turned into a grave, pale expression, and then finally, absolute horror!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There were thick splatters of blood that covered the passenger carriages, so much so that nobody could tell what was going on within these carriages. That said, they immediately knew that Qin Ye’s claim was likely true.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was a Hell Express!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But… but how is this possible?!!” Bai Yishan screamed frantically, “Two Soul Hunters!! We’ve got two Soul Hunters! How is this possible?!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Obsidian Heaven’s Eye Bowl… that’s right! What happened to the bowl?!”</span></p>
