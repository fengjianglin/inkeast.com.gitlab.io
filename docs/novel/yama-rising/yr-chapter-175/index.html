 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye furrowed his brows, “What do you mean?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis responded coldly, “You won’t be able to defeat even a single one of these extraterritorial emissaries this time. It’s not your fault. It’s just that you’d joined the ranks of Hell a little too late, and you’re unable to tap on the powers available to emissaries of the old Hell. That said… this doesn’t mean there’s no way to kill them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She stared soullessly into the distant night sky, “This is Cathay’s Hell we’re talking about. We were the strongest underworld back then. The fact that these abominations are here is tantamount to a challenge against Hell’s authority! Don’t you wish you could… make them leave their lives behind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye coughed lightly, “I don’t have that level of dignity and self-respect…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was evident just how strong his will to survive was.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, this desire for survival was immediately suppressed by Arthis’ chilling gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Cough… about that… well, go on… I’m listening, and I’m open to suggestions…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis withdrew her gaze and muttered with conviction, “I’ll enter you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Once I enter your body, I’ll be able to display abilities of at least the Hellguard level. I’ll even have access to the underworldly arts. It wouldn’t be an issue taking them down at that point in time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">WTF?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye’s lips quivered, “About that… Did I mishear you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis smiled faintly, “You misheard nothing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’ll mount you from the front.” “I refuse.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Three seconds later, a particular instructor’s room was thrown into disarray, and it took some time before peace settled in the room once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis’ domineering personality was in full bloom. With one foot on the bed and one hand on Qin Ye’s shoulder, she stared at Qin Ye with a dangerous gleam in her eyes, “What do you mean? Are you saying that my otherworldly beauty isn’t good enough for you? And don’t you think you’re rejecting me too outrightly? I’m hurt…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye’s desire to survive trumped every other consideration in his heart. He tugged shamelessly at his blanket and trembled on his bed, “No… can’t we discuss this a little bit more? This humble servant of yours isn’t deserving of such a great national beauty like you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“There’s no room for negotiations.” Arthis covered Qin Ye’s mouth with her silicone hands as she smiled in a deep and profound manner, “Do you know something? Killing extraterritorial emissaries nabs you twice the amount of merit points you would get for an equivalent Yin spirit. In other words, killing them would mean attaining the next breakthrough to the rank of an Anitya Hellguard. What’s a bodily sacrifice in light of such a great opportunity like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye scrunched up the corner of his blanket in agony, “... But I don’t even want to be an Anitya Hellguard! I’m just a meagre little Ezreal floundering about with Zeal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Eh? It sounds like you’re despising me aren’t you? Do you know how many people were queuing up to make such requests of me? They were even willing to fork out huge sums of money…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then go find them! Why--... I finally understand - you’re coveting my body! No wonder I got the feeling that you were looking at me funny! Are you finally making your move after seeing the perfect opportunity?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... Where does all this self-confidence come from? Fine. I’m willing to enter a covenant under the Heavenly Dao to the effect that I won’t seize possession of your body. After all, Hell is now directly linked to your soul in any event. It’s decided then. Be good.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis began to write in the air in front of her. Moments later, a contract made of Yin energy appeared in mid-air. Qin Ye scanned through its contents and confirmed that everything was in order.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">But having this damned woman taint my pure body is a huge problem nonetheless! ARRRGGGHH!!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Director! I don’t want this role anymore! You can give it to anyone who wants it!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... I think we’re being too hot-headed about these things. Something so important should be carefully considered… Wait, what are you doing… Holy crap! Let go!!” Qin Ye struggled with everything he got, yet before he could finish, Arthis had already grabbed hold of his hand and pressed his thumbprint onto the contract.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye fell into a state of despondence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Why… isn’t this supposed to be a story of cities and the supernatural? How did it suddenly become a story about a person’s transformation? Can you please draw the line somewhere?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis giggled softly. For some strange reason, she felt incredibly satisfied teasing the last remaining Emissary of Hell, and she revealed a radiant smile on her silicone face, “Then, shall we begin? Don’t be afraid. You’ll get used to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No… wait a minute! What are you going to do? I’m not a willing party! Ahhhhh!!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ten minutes later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye sat up on his bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And a lifeless and limp silicone doll lay on the bed beside him.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The imagery was a little too dirty.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He picked up a mirror, and slowly ran his warm fingers down the side of his face and paused when he arrived at his jaw. He blinked at his reflection and exclaimed in a deep voice, “This kid… is pretty good-looking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t touch me!” Qin Ye gnashed his teeth and yelled at the top of his voice in his mind, “I’m warning you! Don’t do anything weird with my body! Otherwise, I’m breaking up with you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You don’t seem too upset by the situation.” Qin Ye slowly undid his camouflage uniform, “I mean, you even seem to be in the mood for jokes? Eh? Since when did you have abs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What the--!! Get your dirty hands off me! That’s not something for your hands!! I’ll be damned… My eyes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the stuff of mental breakdowns to see yourself touching yourself.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unfortunately, this was only the beginning of his worst nightmare.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin-Arthis-Ye got to her feet, but the first thing she did was to cross a leg tightly over the other. And then, she furrowed her thick brows immediately. The stance was peculiar to the extreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye could feel his bulging being throbbing uncontrollably in his mind, “What in the world are you trying to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet his body didn’t give him any response, and she simply continued to rummage around. Qin Ye began to develop a bad premonition, and he softened his voice and spoke as gently as he could, “I mean… could you please tell me what you’re looking for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Souermei.<span id="footnote-ref-64a4"><a href="#footnote-64a4">[1]</a></span>” Qin Ye’s body responded curtly, “My body just feels like something’s missing…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bloody hell… #%(#*&amp;#$(@!!!” A long string of expletives resounded through every corner of his mind, only to receive a displeased response, “This is business. I’ll return your body to you later. If I don’t use it and get accustomed to it, there might be compatibility issues later on. After all…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His hand picked up a mirror and ran a finger gently across his face, “I’m just a lady when all is said and done…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What kind of business do you run donning a Souermei and going to war?! You’re just a stupid silicone doll!” Qin Ye's mind was on the verge of collapse as he continued cursing at Arthis.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His body suddenly set the mirror down and furrowed his brows, “Those who are to achieve great things in life must not be shackled by the little things in this world. Look at how petty you are… Fine, I won’t put it on. I’ll just have to get accustomed to it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as she finished speaking, Qin Ye discovered his hand shifting away from the bed and plunging straight into his camouflage pants. And then, a peculiar expression ran across his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh my words… What’s this… Doesn’t that feel a little bit strange…” His body moaned.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Get! Away! From! Me!! Take your hands out! Take your hands out right out!!” That was the last straw. Qin Ye went completely bonkers in his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">This is my own absolute domain… how could it be defiled just like that by this old granny?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dozens of minutes later.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His body still revealed a displeased expression on its face, “I still can’t get the hang of it. It just feels as though I’ve got an extra two taels<span id="footnote-ref-67b4"><a href="#footnote-67b4">[2]</a></span> of flesh coming out of my body. Should I… just cut them off? I’ll glue it back for you before leaving your body.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The veins on Qin Ye’s forehead throbbed, “Only two taels?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His body frowned, “Don’t you think your focus is a little bit off the mark? Who do you think I was talking to when I asked for permission to cut them off? And I’m just borrowing your body for a few hours. Why does it always have to be so difficult with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... Big sister, I’m begging you. Can you please just fall into a boiling cauldron and die? Don’t mess with me anymore…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tsk…” Just as Arthis was about to continue, her body suddenly trembled, and Qin Ye promptly passed out on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he woke up again, he found both himself and the silicone doll sitting up at exactly the same time. The silicone doll glanced longingly at her own hands, while Qin Ye immediately reached his hands into his pants.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Phew… my little brothers are still intact. That’s reassuring.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Fortunately, this woman isn’t completely deranged just yet.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Explain.” Qin Ye rolled up his sleeves as he stared daggers at the silicone doll, “Speak! How long have you lusted after my beautiful face? You’ve taken advantage of this opportunity to make use of me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? Hehehe… Haha…” Arthis chuckled dryly, “How’s that possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She continued without missing a beat, “It’s been centuries since I’ve last touched a man, and you’re still unwilling to cut me some slack? Otherwise, do you really think I’d make a move on you given your appearances?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It sounded so cogent and well-reasoned that Qin Ye was actually rendered speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alright.” Having noticed the suicidal glint in Qin ye’s eyes, Arthis flicked her hand, sending Qin Ye back half a meter away, “Bear this in mind - each instance of possession lasts a maximum of two and a half hours.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She added, “The artifact used by those two Nipponese emissaries are actually a replica eight-feet mirror. Although it’s a replica, it has undoubtedly been tainted with the aura of their queen of the underworld, Izanami. I’m certain that the other extraterritorial emissaries would also have brought with them their own treasures that have been blessed by their own lords of the underworlds as well. If I don’t possess your body, Gu Qing soul would most certainly be out of your reach.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye fervently suppressed the thought of tearing Arthis to shreds. After much effort, he finally managed to cool off, sigh deeply and nod his head knowingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gu Qing’s resume made him perfect for Hell right now. Letting him slip out of his grasp would be too much of a waste.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And most importantly, the actions of the extraterritorial emissaries were tantamount to a barrage of slaps to his face - and resounding ones at that.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hell was once among the top - if not the top - underworld around. But now, even riff raff like these dared to come and go as they pleased. Perhaps the other emissaries weren’t aware that the lame Emissary of Hell that they had just clashed against was none other than the future King Yanluo. Nevertheless, even he would feel ashamed.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And not only had they come, they were even attempting to seize Gu Qing’s soul from right under his nose! This was his turf, so how could he stand idly by and tolerate such audacity?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Duty and power came hand in hand. After forking out so much for Hell’s reestablishment, he was naturally entitled to enjoy the power and authority that came along with it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Almost as though she could perceive the contemplations on his heart, Arthis remarked, “Don’t worry. Entering your body… Such possession is completely different from the kind that usurps control from your body. Usurping or seizing is something that any Yin spirit can only do once in its entire lifetime. It would be a waste if I used it on you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye finally smiled and flashed his middle finger right at Arthis, “Although I hate to say this… but… thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’re friends with benefits, aren’t we?” Arthis glanced out of the window and muttered through gritted teeth, “Those who dare cause trouble in Cathay had better be prepared to die for it. This is something that all underworlds have known since time immemorial.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“We’re the only ones allowed to seize from others. Having a soul seized from us is an occurrence so rare that it’s practically unheard of.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She gently tightened her grip, and the window frame immediately cracked, “Since they’ve forgotten these universal principles… then I, as the remaining Judge, shall take it upon myself to remind them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye mulled over it, “How confident are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“At least seventy percent.” Arthis turned around responded firmly, “Possession without usurpation means that my abilities will fall by one qualitative level. An Anitya Hellguard is only one level above Soul Hunters. Furthermore, all of them are equipped to the teeth with treasures blessed by their respective lords of the underworld. This is why I wouldn’t dare say that I’m a hundred percent confident.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... Weren’t you just speaking as though it were a done deal?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“...&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Weren’t you the one who told me the first thing I should do every morning is to pump myself up?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“... Ah… Dear, I think you’ve got it all wrong…”</span></p>
