 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third row was already filled with approximately twenty people. He looked up at the main stage and noticed that eight people had already taken centerstage. Each of them were at least in their fifties, and none of them smiled. Instead, they simply nodded to acknowledge the uproarious applause before taking their seats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hello, S9527.” Just then, a hand stretched into Qin Ye’s field of vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a young man dressed in a ramrod straight suit with a rather elegant disposition. He sported a trendy side parting, and also wore a pair of black-framed glasses. There was a presentable smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“S2328?” Qin Ye shook his hand, “You’re different from what I’d expected…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...” S2328 didn’t quite know how to respond to that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Su Feng.” He pushed up his glasses and he squinted at Qin Ye for a moment before changing the topic, “Did you feel that earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye looked him straight in the eye for several seconds, and then he closed his eyes once more before muttering softly, “That time… had somewhat been erased?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re steadier than I’d thought you’d be.” Su Feng smiled faintly as he leaned back into his chair, “You’re hardly anything like the Muscular Pretty Boy that you portray yourself to be online… I might have found myself a decent research subject.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re more unrestrained than I’d expected too.” Qin Ye chuckled as he leaned back on his chair as well. Then, Qin Ye added with a voice that was audible to only the two of them, “Is there any danger?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Feng muttered, “Naturally… A few days ago, we investigated the anomalous Yin energy fluctuations that were emitted that night. As it turns out, Styx’s records show that the Yin energy fluctuations lasted only 0.001 seconds long. And this burst of Yin energy has never appeared at any other time in the history of the City of Salvation spanning close to two thousand years.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Furthemore, we haven’t been able to find the source of the burst of Yin energy to date. But…” He lifted his eyes and suddenly changed the topic, “Do you see that man seated in the center? That’s the esteemed Mr Zhou, Deputy Chief Investigator of the entire Special Investigations Department. Next to him is the Provincial Governor, the Deputy Provincial Governor, the Mayor of the city, the Deputy Mayor of the city, and the last three are the two major directors of the Special Investigations Department - the Director of Finance and Political Affairs, and the Director of Operations…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye heaved a sigh of relief, “I feel much more assured seeing such esteemed members of the organization here.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In other words, even if the sky collapses, he wouldn’t be the one bearing the brunt of the burden on his own.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then again, the fact that these esteemed people are present further confirms his earlier suspicions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The source of that anomalous burst of Yin energy was not in an active state.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Cough.” Just then, a majestic wave of true energy swept across the entire plaza. The Deputy Chief Investigator was a plump man with a mix of black and white hair. He appeared genial and kind. That said, the entire venue was silenced in that moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Whoosh…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;It was as though an invisible hand had swept gently across the entire venue, and even the birds of the sky and the winds had ceased completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A peak Judge-class entity…” Arthis muttered softly, “He’s one level stronger than I am… By way of extrapolation, I think it’s safe to say that there must be a Prefect-class entity within the Special Investigations Department’s forces. Kid, now that you’ve infiltrated their organisation, it might be prudent to remain cautious in your future dealings with them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The plump man didn’t immediately speak up. After that single cough, he looked around at the audience and nodded meaningfully. Then, he smiled genially.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let us begin.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three simple words. No unnecessary rambling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Almost everyone in the audience drew a deep breath and sat up straight.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It has begun…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Today, the world of cultivation of the mortal realm and the world of ghosts and spirits of the netherworld would be publicly revealed to the 3.2 million citizens residing in the City of Salvation!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">9.10 a.m. Not a single person was on the streets. The citizens of the City of Salvation were all at their own homes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A woman in trendy clothes sat in front of her computer while holding a drink. However, she didn’t drink from it. Her eyes were transfixed on her computer screen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Three middle school students in school uniforms sat together, breathing faintly as they stared intently at the television screen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Another family was eating breakfast together. But as soon as the broadcast began, they increased the volume of their television to the maximum and waited with bated breaths.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire city - countless streets and countless homes - had stopped entirely as they turned their attention to the nearest LED screens around them, watching the very same historic moment unfold before their very eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps some of the civil servants among you might have heard of us, the Special Investigations Department. Let me make some formal introductions. I’m the Deputy Chief Investigator of the Special Investigations Department, Zhou Xianlong.” The plump man was incredibly commanding, yet his words were also concise and succinct, “Our department is considered a top secret establishment in Cathay, and we are in charge of all supernatural phenomena occurring across the entire country.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He nodded his head intently. Suddenly, a massive LED screen that was ten meters wide and three meters high slowly rose from the bottom of the stage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those who were seated in front of their own televisions watched intently without a single word. Old men with white hair gripped tightly to their walking sticks; children holding onto lollipops stared at the screens with widened eyes; while other young men and women watched with blazing passion in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The entire City of Salvation was completely silent at this very moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone had a vague inkling that the highly unscientific organization that sat high among the echelons of Cathay’s top organizations would soon open their eyes to a whole new world!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ssst…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;A set of images lit up on the LED screen. It revealed a plain, white book that was about an inch thick. A few words were mechanically etched onto the cover of the book -&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Records of Supernatural Incidents.</span></p>

And then some more!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Four or five books filled a single shelf. As the image pulled further and further away, everyone saw that… this was a massive room that was filled with twenty to thirty storage cabinets! And innumerable personnel in white coats zipped about the room, retrieving volumes of these records from time to time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each of the cabinets were filled with at least dozens of shelves full of records! There were easily hundreds of volumes of such records within the massive room!</span></p>

We know them as ‘Yin spirits’. As soon as they develop some form of sentience, these entities would immediately recognize their innate thirst for flesh and blood. How many thousands of human beings do you think have perished to ghosts since the founding of our nation? We, the Special Investigations Department, act as the vanguard in this war against the netherworld. We are fighting for humanity!”</span></p>

The Special Investigations Department won’t accept any invectives, and neither will our nation!”</span></p>

The looks on the faces of those in attendance was quite different from those hiding behind the televisions and screens. Those who were in attendance, whether young or old, had a bright gleam in their eyes, almost as though the revelation had ignited their hearts with renewed vigor.</span></p>
