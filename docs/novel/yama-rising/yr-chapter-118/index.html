 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Roar!! Roar! Sss!!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Li Cheng had finally lost it all. He swung his claws wildly at his own mother. Unfortunately, he was still a young child compared to his mother. His strength was still a far cry from Song Jiafang, and he was therefore unable to cause any damage to his mother. That said, Song Jiafang didn’t retaliate either. Instead, she simply hugged Li Cheng tightly, preventing it from getting any closer to Li Jiankang. </span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was the manifestation of yet another type of instinct.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The maternal instinct.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just like when she had been hacked down by her very own son, she simply couldn’t bear to hurt her own child.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thus, she simply remained still and silent as she allowed her child to claw madly at her.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Run…” Song Jiafang turned her bloodshot eyes to Li Jiankang and blurted, “Run… leave us… run!!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Jiankang was completely dumbfounded. He stared at both vampires with an inexplicably complex gaze in his eyes. His lips trembled, yet he found himself completely at a loss for words.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was almost as though he had only just realized what kind of monstrosity he had raised.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let go…” He shut his eyes with a complex smile on his face, “Ah Fang… let him go…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“When we were still alive, we let go of him when we should’ve been holding him close… So now… what’s the point of holding onto him any longer?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The female vampire covered in knife wounds acted as though she hadn’t heard his comments, and she continued to grab tightly to Li Cheng’s neck.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Let go… let go!!” Despite the disparity in strength, Li Cheng’s explosive strength caused by the manifestation of his extreme hunger was still extraordinary. Song Jiafang refused to manhandle Li Cheng, while Li Cheng’s strength only grew with his escalating desperation for food. Finally, with a shrill shriek, Li Cheng wrested free of Song Jiafang’s grasp and charged towards Li Jiankang madly.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Dad… dad… dad… my beloved father…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m… coming…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Since you love me so much… you’ll let me have a bite, won’t you?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Cheng’s gaping wide mouth and rows of sharp teeth quickly closed in on Li Jiankang. Li Jiankang instinctively motioned to put up a defensive posture. Yet in the very next second, as though something came over him, he held back and simply closed his eyes.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Kkkrrr.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the sickly sound of crunching bones.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">AHHHHHHHH!!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Song Jiafang unleashed a miserable wail. She completely ignored Qin Ye and darted straight towards Li Jiankang’s body.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Cheng had clamped his powerful jaws down onto Li Jiankang’s neck, and he was now sucking and drinking from Li Jiankang’s thick, red blood.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Li Jiankang’s gaze was transfixed on Song Jiafang. Although her hair was disheveled, her skin was covered in black hair, and her expressions were incomparably hideous and inhumane, a peculiar smile continued to creep up the corner of his lips.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">It’s finally over…</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">This must be the feeling of release…</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">My sins… have they finally been paid in full…?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">It’s not worth it… It’s not worth living in paranoia; it’s not worth living life in constant regret, and it’s most certainly not worth perpetrating wrongdoing… After all, good and evil must always be repaid. And the price of these things are far too large…</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His pupils grew dilated, and his body started to shrivel up. He lifted his hands slightly, before finally letting it fall limply.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“AHHHHHH!! Unfilial… son! Unfilial son!! Sss…!!” Song Jiafang charged frantically towards Li Cheng’s side. Two streams of tears had actually flowed out from the corner of her eyes. Then, in a fit of hysteria, she finally grabbed Li Cheng by the neck and snapped it without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Crack…</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was also the sound of snapping bones.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Li Cheng’s head had been completely ripped off his body. But his head didn’t fall down because his jaws were still clamped down tightly onto Li Jiankang’s neck. Their heads remained next to each other.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as though father and son had finally been reunited in death. They had been granted the peace and tranquility that they so desired.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye slowly unsheathed his saber.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps Li Jiankang’s death might have been unnatural and unjustifiable in the eyes of the law of the mortal realm.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But in his eyes, everything was fully justified and stood to reason.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A life for a life. It was only right and proper.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The final act of the Li family incident had finally drawn to its close. All that remained was Song Jiafang, the single most innocent person in the entire incident.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You should be on your way when you’re ready as well.” Qin Ye pointed his saber at the vampire as he spoke placidly.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She appeared not to have heard his words. Yet, three seconds later, she let out a slight whimper.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, it grew louder and louder, escalating from a soft choke into a loud bawl.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ghosts knew grief too.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Or perhaps she no longer had the capacity to consciously grieve, and this was merely a manifestation of her instincts.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She leaned heavily on Li Jiankang’s body. Their three heads were all clumped together, with Li Cheng’s severed head resting between his two parents’ heads. It was almost akin to a family portrait.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye sighed softly, and swung his saber down onto Song Jiafang’s head heavily.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vampires can only be destroyed by way of decapitation. Although Song Jiafang was still able to display some measure of instinct and spiritual intelligence, who was to say this would be the case in a few years’ time?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Therefore, he still had no choice but to kill her.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t worry, I’ll keep your soul safe and send you to a good place. You… have been a good mother.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, just as Qin Ye’s saber struck Song Jiafang’s neck, the entire room shook violently, and Qin Ye’s demonhead saber was immediately repelled back.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the very next second, scarlet markings appeared on the bodies of both vampires. It was akin to a revelation of an ancient seal or talisman powered by their bloodlines.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The markings continued to flow continuously, and it appeared almost as though something were about to burst forth from the bodies of the vampires!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It has begun.” Arthis flew in front of Qin Ye and continued, “The reason why the Great Intergenerational Heredity is so rarely seen is because the onerous conditions must be precisely met.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Firstly, the progenitor must have been a ghost while she was alive. In other words, she would have to be a living human being when she turned into a ghost, whether of her own volition or due to natural causes.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Secondly, this ghastly progenitor must also be a mother, and she must have been pregnant when she turned into a ghost. This will allow her to pass down her ghastly bloodline. Just like the humans’ research into DNA, ghosts are also able to conceal their latent DNA within the cells of human beings as well.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye responded, “So when these conditions are fulfilled, the phenomenon will be triggered?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis nodded her head, “That’s right. The third condition is that someone in the latter generations must naturally possess a Yin vein, and thereafter be transformed into a ghost while he or she is still alive. This will then trigger the phenomenon of the Great Intergenerational Heredity.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye nodded slightly, but then immediately recalled something. He turned to look at Li Cheng’s head, and then gasped loudly.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Transformed into a ghost while he’s still alive… are you saying…”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right.” Arthis muttered, “Li Cheng… didn’t die back then.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It was Li Jiankang who had mistaken him for dead and begun to raise him as a vampire… Take a look at his coffin. There’s simply no way of unlocking it from the inside. Li Cheng… had died of suffocation only as a result of Li Jiankang’s attempt to raise him as a vampire.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye sighed, and then suddenly smiled again.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Isn’t this divine retribution?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">True… it may have come late, but it still arrived in the end.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">Sss!!!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;With two loud cries, the red sigils on the vampire’s body suddenly glowed with a brilliant luster that engulfed the room with a scarlet light. It was like the blossoming of a red spider lily. Just then, the two vampires who were locked in a tight embrace began to be peeled apart by the red light.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The vampires’ incomparably hard iron-black skin suddenly cracked, everywhere, revealing an explosion of light from within the body like brilliant red gemstones. One moment later, and with a loud muffled bang, the two vampires exploded into a fiery inferno, causing a ferocious gale to sweep through the room.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s going on?” Qin Ye stared at the inferno in bewilderment. The inferno was approximately one meter high. Even though it was an inferno of flames, it felt as cold as ice. Most of all, Qin Ye could sense the Yin energy belonging to a vengeful apparition brewing in the heart of it all.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a materialization from the void. The energy signature of the Yin energy didn’t belong to any of the family members. It was almost as though… a new being were presently being created from nothing at all!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As though she could read his mind, Arthis calmly explained, “This isn’t creation. Creating, especially the birth of man, is something that is accessible only by gods, and perhaps only King Yanluo. What’s happening now… is merely the revelation of something that had previously been hidden.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“For instance, the eruption of the previously concealed Yin energy within their bodies. In other words… their progenitor.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye didn’t ask anymore.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was because the soulfire had blossomed into the shape of a blooming crimson lotus. And a person stood in the heart of this lotus.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was an illusory figure.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was an illusory woman!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though dead, her features were still just as clear as day. She appeared to be approximately eighteen or nineteen years old, and she presented with short, neatly groomed hair. Her body could only be described as beautiful. Her curves were in all the right places, and there was a heavenly charm about her.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She was dressed in a cheongsam, and she was 1.68 meters tall. Her alluring, fair thighs peeked through the slits on the side of her skirt. She had sharp eyebrows, a dainty nose, and cherry red lips. Her eyes were striking, and there was even a small mole seated right under her right eye that accentuated her features that much more.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye was stunned.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s this?” He looked at the lady that hadn’t opened her eyes as he asked Arthis.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Arthis simply chuckled bitterly, “What’s this? She’s just a little prodigal wench.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can recognize the slutty stench from her body with my eyes closed! Anyway, I hadn’t finished my explanations earlier. As soon as the Great Intergenerational Heredity has been triggered, the host will immediately die a violent death, and the latent spirit of the progenitor would immediately take control of the fleshly body of the host. But since the host’s body had already been transformed into a vampire, the progenitor’s spirit naturally appeared in this form.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye blinked his eyes curiously, before suddenly probing Arthis with some measure of mischief, “Why do I sense some measure of hostility emanating from you?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hostility?” Arthis chuckled contemptuously, “Do you think a woman of her stature is fit to incite any feeling of hostility from me? One - she’s inferior to me. Two - her tongue isn’t hanging out, and it can’t touch the ground either. Poor form! Three - whatever the case may be, she’s just not worth mentioning in the same breath as me.”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Understood in an instant.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">A duel between beauties…</span><span>&nbsp;Qin Ye nodded meaningfully. </span><span style="font-style: italic">Speaking of which, are you even aware of the kind of image you have as Arakshasa?</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“With all due respect… as a normal, healthy male, I do find her rather… ahem… could you not give me that kind of death glare? You might cause a misunderstanding and give me the impression that you’re coveting my otherworldly beauty… Alright, alright, you’re the most beautiful, and she can hardly hold a candle to you!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And if I may be blunt, do you know what’s the best place for the ghost of the Great Intergenerational Heredity to go?” Arthis responded placidly.</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye coughed dryly. His face flushed, and he tapped his fist against his lips as he suggested, “King Yanluo’s harem?”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis immediately barked back in rage, “Are you saying that I’m not worthy to be a part of your harem?! Do you know how many Infernal Judges had pursued me back in the days, and I’d not even deigned to look at them? Look at yourself! Do you think you have the right to be picky?!”</span></p>
 <p style><span>Qin Ye felt goosebumps all over his body. </span><span style="font-style: italic">Your entire body is just a head. What do you mean… no, we’ve gone well off the tracks. The point is, I’ve never even considered the possibility of something so outrageous to begin with!!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-style: italic">What you’re suggesting is practically the stuff of nightmares!</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No… how could you be harbouring such thoughts? Wake up! It’s time to stop dreaming! The generation gap between us runs as deep as the Straits of Malacca. How could we possibly be compatible with each other?!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis barked back with an even more impassioned response, “And what about you?! You’re broke, ‘submission’ is written all over your face, and your stature as an Emissary of Hell is a far cry from mine! How dare you entertain thoughts of riding on my body?! Where did you get such unreal self-confidence from?!”</span></p>
 <p style><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Bloody hell… how do you even know things like ‘submission’... and can’t you be a little bit more reserved? Who the hell has ever said anything about riding on your body?! Isn’t this just a declaration of your own fantasies?!”</span></p>
