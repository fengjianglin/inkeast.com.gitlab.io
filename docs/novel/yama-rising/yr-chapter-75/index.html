 <p>Everyone, welcome to 2021! &nbsp;2020 has been an absolutely horrid year for many people on many levels, and I think many (most? all?) of us are glad to leave it behind. &nbsp;With that said, I wanted to give everyone a preview for some of the things that are coming up in the coming few months for Wuxiaworld.</p>
 <p><strong>Front-End Site Redesign</strong> - This one has been a long time coming! &nbsp;Historically, we've focused more on incremental changes and feature build-out rather than overhauling the site itself, but for quite a few months now...</p>

However, he couldn’t hear a single word that Su Feng was saying. He gritted his teeth and mustered all the strength he could just so that he could speak, “You… did you feel that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Each and every word he spoke felt like it took as much effort as lifting a massive boulder.</span></p>

He took two seconds to ascertain that Qin Ye was absolutely not joking this time. Then, he immediately opened up his outer coat and pulled out a compass. His actions attracted the looks of several people around, but he could hardly care less at this point in time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, the needle on the compass was as still as ever.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did you feel?” Su Feng held Qin Ye gently and asked.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thump. Thump…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Qin Ye’s heartbeat inexplicably increased in tempo. It was as though he had been completely isolated from the world. This was even worse than the experience of being put through the three-day limit at the start of his journey as an Emissary of Hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He could tell that Zhou Xianlong was still speaking. He could tell that the people around him were chattering. However, he couldn’t hear a single thing that was being said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There weren't even the chirping sounds of birds around. There was nothing at all. In fact… he couldn’t even hear the breaths of the people around him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A ghost in broad daylight…” Arthis gnashed her teeth, “To appear in broad daylight… Something’s really wrong with the City of Salvation! Come to think of it, this must have something to do with the creatures that had survived Hell’s collapse… After all, there’s no way they would be able to stand against the might of the entire mortal realm on their own… But if they joined forces…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But why… A Hunter-class ghost like Cao Youdao was able to survive for such a long time… and all this while, nobody thought to seize from him this succulent piece of meat that the City of Salvation is? And the defenses of Insignia Province are substantially lower than that of Westriver Province to boot…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The only possible explanation is that there’s something else amiss with this place - something that only the old ghosts know about. This is why nobody dared to seize the City of Salvation for themselves to begin with!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do we do?” Qin Ye had already placed his hands at his waist. He could tell that nobody apart from him could even perceive the presence of the mysterious entity bearing down on him. It was highly likely… that he was the target of this mysterious presence!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was nothing around his waist at the moment. But adopting this stance meant that he was ready to pull out his saber at the moment’s notice as soon as there was a real crisis.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Be ready to run.” Arthis’ voice drifted through the air. Yet before she could even finish speaking, the silent world that Qin Ye was in suddenly echoed with a clear, distinct thud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It sounded as though something had stepped on the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">For instance… the sound of shoes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was bowed over slightly, and he could hear that the sound came from a location that was approximately twenty meters away. Then, the same sound repeated itself.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thud. Thud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was a dazzling day, and there was a large gathering of people around him. Yet his hands and feet felt inexplicably cold.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though… something was headed straight towards him!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thud… thud…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The sound was neither quick nor slow. Qin Ye glanced about him, yet he saw nothing out of the ordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t see it!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Naturally… The fact that it’s able to show itself in broad daylight… means that it is at least an incarnate revenant! I’ve got it! You can use the oldest possible trick in the book… bend over and peek through your legs!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye drew a deep breath and bent his body even lower, until his head bumped against the seat in front of him. Then, he peeked through his legs!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And he nearly screamed out loud in the very next moment!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were seated in rows after rows of seats.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Logically speaking, he should only see pairs after pairs of feet if he peeked under his seat and through his legs.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However… when he looked under his seat, he didn’t see a single pair of legs behind him. Instead, the only thing he saw… was another head!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was as though someone seated behind him was doing the exact same thing and staring straight back into his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">An intense feeling of terror spread surged from his face straight through the depths of his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The person looking back at him was a woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A dead woman.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Her hair dangled down loosely in a disheveled fashion. Her pale face was covered all over with greenish purple livor mortis spots. Two deep, dark orifices stood where her eyes ought to have been. The woman had her mouth wide open, and grisly, black worms could be seen crawling madly from within. To make matters worse, the two of them were hardly half a meter apart from each other!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ugh!” He covered his mouth and forcibly maintained his hunched posture. But just then, he suddenly heard another clear, distinct sound coming from just beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Thud…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The sound had finally stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That thing… had stopped just beside him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">T-t-t-t-t…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;This was the first time he had experienced such a chilling, blood-curdling sensation in the depths of his heart. His teeth chattered uncontrollably. He was nearly unable to resist the urge to enter his Hell’s Emissary state and pull out his demonhead saber. If not for the fact that Arthis had been gently swaying about in her soul sphere, bumping and nudging him repeatedly in his pocket, he would already have caved to the pressure and armed himself by now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an incredibly oppressive and stifling presence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed a colourful robe flow into vision.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There were seven colours, all of which appeared to have been haphazardly stitched together. The colours were bright and vibrant, but the material looked shoddy, as though the robe had been worn for eons on end. Just like that, the entity wearing the robe stood just beside him.</span></p>

He didn’t dare to move a single muscle. The presence didn’t move any longer. Despite the fact that it was daytime now, he could tell that this entity didn’t cast a single shred of shadow on the ground!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One second, two seconds… five seconds… ten seconds.</span></p>

Then, on the eleventh second, he suddenly felt an icy, marrow-chilling breath caressing the top of his head.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This entity… was gently combing his hair.</span></p>

Qin Ye’s neck stiffened, and he remained absolutely still.</span></p>

It had only been three seconds, yet his entire back was already covered in sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, after the third second, the presence suddenly vanished as peculiarly as it had first arrived.</span></p>

Are you alright?” When he finally returned to his senses, he discovered that there were already several other cultivators standing around and supporting him and asking if he was fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m alright…” Qin Ye shut his eyes and leaned back into his chair. His heart was still thumping wildly from the intense encounter. Su Feng glanced at him with a complicated expression in his eyes, but he knew that now was hardly a good time to ask about his experience. Just as he was about to retract his arm to pull out a packet of tissues for Qin Ye, he found Qin Ye grabbing onto his arm instead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye’s grip was incredibly tight, and his voice was hoarse, “Tell me exactly how you discovered that anomalous wave of Yin energy. And… how you’d managed to assess its energy levels…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Su Feng’s gaze quivered, and he immediately responded, “Did you… discover something earlier?”</span></p>

Are you feeling overwhelmed by the fact that you’ve been awarded the title of top ten exemplary investigative officers for the year?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye slowly got to his feet in a daze, and the entire venue erupted with thunderous applause. His close-up was distinctly captured and projected to the large LED screen, as well as all of the televisions in the households of the citizens.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is an investigative officer?” “He’s pretty good-looking… it’s quite different from what I’d expected them to look like.”</span></p>

We had an investigation officer at our school all this while?” “No… it seems true. I vaguely remember him collecting something from our office some days ago…” “What the hell… we’ve… we’ve been in such close proximity with such an awesome person all this while?” “Which dorm is he staying in?”</span></p>

He grimaced and looked at the main stage in embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Was it too much of a surprise?” The Judge-class expert was incredibly sharp, and he had already noticed that Qin Ye was earlier feeling somewhat unwell in his seat. Thus, he smiled faintly and improvised, “That’s fine. I’ll read it again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Newly-appointed sentinel S9527.

The government of the mortal realm is far too good at distorting the truth!”</span></p>

He slowly minced his way towards the stage as he gnashed his teeth and muttered under his breath, “I won’t let the cat out of the bag, will I? I can feel my stomach churn with reverence from standing so close to a Judge-class entity!”</span></p>
