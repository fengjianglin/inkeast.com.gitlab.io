 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had thought that this was going to be paradise for pretension.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had thought that he was going to be able to maintain an image of being an approachable S-class member and make random posts whenever he was idle and free. Who would have expected such a tight slap to the face by the wolf clan chieftain almost as soon as he let loose?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Turning his grief into his strength, Qin Ye gritted his teeth and scrolled through the rest of the forums and finally found a post he was looking for.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s with the special treatment? We need an outlet for communication as well! Community: 71273563, S-class members are welcome to join! Information is the source of your strength!” -- S4396.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">This is it!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye immediately clicked on it and was redirected to a download link. As soon as he clicked on the download link, he immediately closed it.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s the matter?” Arthis was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“... I might have clicked on the wrong link…” Qin Ye hesitated, and clicked on the message again. He was redirected to download the same app.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Would you like to download the app, Momo? You’re not connected to Wi-Fi at the moment. Please note that data charges may apply.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">God damn it, Momo!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye couldn’t help but give the app developer a huge thumbs up - the cultivator who developed this app must be a genius!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that not it?” The ancient old granny, Arthis, peeked over Qin Ye’s shoulder and attempted to probe further for his response.</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Ye gazed deeply into the distance -&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">Do you really not know what exactly the Momo app is all about?</span></p>
 <p><span>“It’s undoubtedly directing me to this link… But I get the strange feeling that I’ve downloaded the wrong app…” He clicked on the confirmation, and the download was promptly completed. As soon as he opened the app, the word “</span><span style="font-style: italic">Momo</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">” immediately appeared in the foreground with a striking pink colour, overlaid across a beautiful lady’s picture in the background. The logo was all too familiar to Qin Ye’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Did I accidentally download a fake chatting app?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Incidentally, Wang Chenghao happened to glance curiously over at Qin Ye’s phone at exactly this moment, and he immediately gave Qin Ye a look of horror.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No… Brother Qin, how thirsty must you be feeling right now?” Then, almost as though he were a dog that had just sensed meat on a bone, he mischievously minced his way towards Qin Ye’s side and added enthusiastically, “It’s great if you are! Brother Qin, let me explain to you how amazing Momo truly is… I’ll teach you how to geolocate, how to search. Most importantly… you’ll need a picture of my half-naked body! And a perfect profile message!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye silently sized up Wang Chenghao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Come to think about it, Wang Chenghao is indeed good-looking, and well-built. Damn! He’s even got money!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was suddenly overwhelmed with the urge to kill Wang Chenghao.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You?” Qin Ye sneered.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Brother Qin… I’ll admit you’re fairly good looking too. But what’s popular on Momo these days are muscular, pretty boys like me, and not innocent, effeminate men like you. Come on, come on… let me teach you. First, you’ll have to have some branded goods, understand? LV, Gucci and DG used to be alright, but you’ll be despised if you have them right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Oh? Must I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Of course. These days, apart from your body and appearances, the next thing the ladies on Momo look at are whether your branded goods make the cut or not…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just then, Arthis’ chilling voice cut through the impassioned discussion of both men, “Shouldn’t you at least open the app?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Instant silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye coughed dryly and glanced at Wang Chenghao with a somber look on his face, “What’s in your mind? Do you think about these kinds of things all day long? Mr Sledgehammer, how many times must I repeat myself?! If you want to succeed in life, don’t be a coward and just go for it! As soon as the Academy of Cultivators is enrolling students, I’ll recommend you, and you can give it a shot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao’s heart was flustered, confused and all over the place. It was almost as though the person who had been discussing the app with him with such immense passion and vigor were a completely different person.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye picked up his phone and switched it back on. In an instant, rows of pictures that could easily be rated 9/10 showed up.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Looking for a husband, lonely.” The picture was that of a pair of lovely, slender legs in black stockings. The message stated, “Don’t come looking for me if you’re not at least Operative-class. I won’t entertain you if you’re less than 18. I don’t want to have to look after you when we’re expunging ghosts together!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Signed: S7483.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Vulgar!” Arthis snorted, “Fortunately, there’s still some basic morality left in this world. At least she knows not to prey on minors.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye coughed dryly, “18… might refer to centimeters…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arthis was instantly silenced.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye was somewhat speechless as well. Were all female cultivators so loose these days?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Each and every single picture was provocative in some way or another. As he scrolled through the profiles, he finally came to one that appeared somewhat normal. The picture was that of a beautiful woman with long, flowing hair, wearing a long white dress. Her legs dangled by the edge of the pool, gently splashing the surface of the water.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Not bad…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Qin Ye’s eyes brightened. She suited his tastes perfectly. Yet, as soon as he clicked on her profile, his eyes almost fell out of its sockets.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is the villa that my ex-husband gave me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But I’m still lacking a Maserati. Are you willing to give one to me?” -- S1102</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rubbish!” Qin Ye closed her profile in a fit of rage, “How are all of the women on Momo so outrageous these days?! It’s already so hard to find someone who’s easy on the eyes, yet the first thing she talks about is money! Can a rich man have the qualities I have as well?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao leaned over and took a look at the lady’s profile, “Dear, this profile uses a picture of Dilireba.<span id="footnote-ref-a848"><a href="#footnote-a848">[1]</a></span>”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“......”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Resist the urge, and endure.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">No wonder the picture looked so familiar.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He keyed in the name of the community in the search bar and quickly joined its group. A voice prompt told him that the group had allowed members to join automatically as long as they met the necessary prerequisites. The verification was processed by Styx against its database, and its accuracy was undeniable. Qin Ye’s application was accepted almost immediately after making his request to join the group.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Welcome to the group! *flower emoticon*x2” -- Roly-Poly.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Eh? We’ve got a newcomer? Not bad! Welcome, welcome.” -- The Blade That Cuts the World.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Newcomer, you’ve not changed your default username yet. Why don’t you change it, and then introduce yourself? *saliva emoticon*” -- Woman on a Swing.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">I can finally change my damned username!</span></p>
 <p><span>Qin Ye heaved a sigh of relief, and changed his username to “</span><span style="font-style: italic">Muscular Pretty Boy</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">”.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, he glanced at Wang Chenghao, “Send me a picture of your half-nudes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wang Chenghao sent him a bunch.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I only asked for your topless pictures!! What the hell did you send me!! Bloody hell… my eyes! My eyes!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You didn’t specify… Brother Qin, you’re far too reserved…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everything was done within moments, and the entire group was silent as soon as the Muscular Pretty Boy took centerstage.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seconds later, the Woman on a Swing laughed awkwardly, “Friend… do you really think that this app is one and the same as Momo…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye’s heart grew somewhat bitter. He did think of this place as Momo…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Whose fault is it for making it look so similar?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Forget it. The name doesn’t matter. It’s oddly catchy as well… Friend, why don’t you introduce yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Greetings. I’m 18, and I’ve just taken up office as a sentinel in the City of Salvation…” Qin Ye typed slowly as he responded.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hang on!” The Blade That Cuts the World interjected, “You’re only 18?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sentinel?” Another user named Berserk Old Dog responded with a series of shocked emoticons, “Are you messing with us?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A torrent of abuse immediately filled the page.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If I recall correctly, the prerequisite for being a sentinel is that you must be at least of the Soul Hunter level.” “That’s right… Are you sure you were referring to your age? And not centimeters?” “An 18 years-old Soul Hunter? Bloody hell, have I been wasting my time cultivating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Eh?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Everything felt right with the world once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When god closes the door to paradise to you, he will surely open up the door to another heavenly kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye couldn’t help but praise god.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He responded resolutely, “That’s right. I didn’t want to join before, but the supernatural outbreak last night has made me change my mind. You can verify my details with Styx.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone was immediately silenced.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a long time, the Woman on a Swing finally responded, “Embittered. Signing off. Going to eat some desserts to pick myself up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ditto… This group is getting more and more evil… I don’t think I’ll be revisiting the community in a while…” “I’m filled with vexation. It suddenly feels as though there’s a hierarchy, even amongst us S-class members…” “I feel like I’m more suited to be labelled an M. This group is no longer suitable for me. This is farewell, world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Oops…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Qin Ye’s heart felt awash with emotions…</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-style: italic">Can you guys even breach nine hunting zones in one night like I did?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just then, Qin Ye suddenly received a call.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He picked up the call. The caller on the other end spoke with the voice of a young man, “Soul Hunter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. And you are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m the deputy leader of the community. You can call me Cang Haixiao. I’m also a Soul Hunter.” Qin Ye discovered that he had just been promoted to a moderator of the group before the man had even finished speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“All Soul Hunter experts are moderators. This is one of the rules of this community.” Cang Haixiao explained casually before asking, “Are you at the City of Salvation?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You… did you experience anything out of the ordinary last night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye furrowed his brows before responding in earnest, “No. In fact, there’s only one hunting zone left within the City of Salvation. It can be disposed of summarily at any time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cang Haixiao didn’t respond.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seconds later, the other person continued hoarsely, “My registration number is S2328, and I’m an officer of the Anomaly Investigations Center located at Yan Capital. Last night, we detected an immeasurably large reading of Yin energy emanating from the City of Salvation. I can confirm that Styx isn’t malfunctioning either.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s impossible!” Qin Ye rebuffed, “The head honcho in the City of Salvation is already dead. The appearance of an existence exceeding the Soul Hunter level is just impossible. Besides, the inspector, who’s also a Hellguard-class expert, is still at the City of Salvation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cang Haixiao remained placid, “But Styx can’t be wrong either. That leaves us with one possible explanation…”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He continued gravely, “Would a person perceive anything anomalous from the sky?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye didn’t immediately understand what he was talking about.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nevertheless, the man continued with his explanation, “In other words, that source of Yin energy might have been so great that it had completely surpassed the limits of your perception when it blanketed the entire city. This would explain why all of you weren’t able to perceive it. It’s because you’re right in the midst of it all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you know what the Yin level is?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then, without waiting for Qin Ye’s response, he added, “Thirty million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you know what the Yin energy reading was when the entire country was plagued by the great famine in the ‘60s?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye suddenly had a bad hunch about the situation, “How much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Cang Haixiao chuckled softly, “Six million.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“And to put things into perspective, if we convert the amount of energy available at the disposal of Soul Hunters like us to Yin energy, our reading would range from five thousand to ten thousand.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye covered his speaker and turned to Arthis, “Did you feel anything amiss last night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No.” Arthis had also heard the conversation, “I didn’t detect any anomalies. But that level of Yin energy is far greater than the level of Yin energy I possess… I can’t quite believe it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After all, wouldn’t believing in such an outrageous phenomenon be endorsing the idea that the City of Salvation hides an existence that was five times stronger than the drought demons that had ravaged Cathay back in the ‘60s?!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What kind of concept was that?</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even the term ‘millennial ghost’ couldn’t sufficiently describe how terrifying such an existence was!</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“These news are privy to only the top brass within the City of Salvation. Friend, do be careful.” Cang Haixiao cautioned with a deep, profound voice, “As we speak, three teams from the National Institute of Anomalous Sciences are already rushing towards the City of Salvation. You must take care. S-class existences… are our final bastion of hope. Do take care at the public broadcast in three days’ time. I’m afraid… something anomalous might occur at that time.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Separately…” The man smiled, “You should’ve received your employment letter from the Academy of Cultivators, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Qin Ye smiled, “That’s right. I’ve accepted it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then in that case… we’ll be seeing each other very soon.” The man’s voice grew somewhat distant and profound, “The Academy of Cultivators… It’s a good place. I’ve got some C-grade cases on hand right now, and I was just fretting over locating the right partner for the job.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t die, and don’t tell anybody about our conversation. I’ll see you soon.”</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yama Rising is finally hitting the shelves! I'm absolutely stoked about this novel simply because of its sheer magnitude and epic proportions. There are elements of cultivation and levels and kingdom building, and everything is stretched to a massive scale concerning an entire realm. If you like horror elements, the story follows the protagonist as he embarks on various investigations uncovering the truth behind supernatural incidents. There are moments in this novel which would resonate strong...</p>
