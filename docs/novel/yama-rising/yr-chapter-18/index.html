 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He put her on the speakerphone, yet there was no sound. It was almost as though his phone had been connected to the bottomless abyss in the depths of Hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everything had suddenly gone incredibly silent. Then, about twenty seconds later, Qin Ye finally heard the first audible sound communicated through the phone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the sound of water droplets.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, it was the sound of water droplets falling from mid-air and striking the ground.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Drip...drip...drip…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The rhythmic drops sounded incredibly still and tranquil, yet eerie at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Urrrgh....uuuurrrrrrrrrgghhhh....” Just then, the phone transmitted a different type of sound altogether. It was faint and barely audible, yet it was a drone that went on and on.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It sounded like the desperate gasping sounds made by a person who had been locked in a dungeon for decades on end and deprived of water. It was the sound emitted by parched throats, almost akin to the sound of glass shards grinding against each other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey dear, that’s poor form.” Qin Ye finally responded, “Stop using the dated spooking techniques of the nineties? It’s a bit underwhelming. Don’t get me wrong - I’m not trying to nag at you, but given that you are a modern-day ghost, don’t you think that you should keep up with the times as well? Is there really any point in mimicking the sounds of a horror film? For that matter, have you even obtained the licensing rights from Ms Ju-On?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t…” A low and hoarse voice could be heard on the other end of the phone. It was intermittent, almost as though someone was playing back an audio recording on an old-fashioned recorder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye sneered, “Don’t? What do you mean by don’t? Are you finally afraid of me now? Weren’t you still happily fooling around earlier?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, it sounded as though Qin Ye’s provocation didn’t even register with the voice on the other end of the phone. Speaking with the same low frequency, the hoarse voice continued, “Butt...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“In!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beeeeeep---</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;As soon as she finished speaking, the line was immediately cut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s a feisty one, isn’t she…” The frivolous expression on Qin Ye’s face diminished substantially as he glanced meaningfully at the soul sphere on the table, “What do you think?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That was quite the insightful interaction.” Arthis paused for a moment of deliberation before continuing, “Firstly, you need to understand the distinction between each rank of ghosts. You’ve been apprised of the differences among the S-grade ghosts through to the E-grade ghosts. The truth of the matters is that there are corresponding qualitative classifications to the ghosts as well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The E-grade ghosts correspond with ordinary souls or spirits. In other words, these are the ghosts that are more commonly known as wandering spirits or drifting spirits. The D-grade ghosts refer to vengeful apparitions. These are ghosts who had been so enraptured by their obsessions prior to death that their spirits were unable to dissipate after they died, thereby becoming vengeful apparitions. The vengeful apparitions only possess ordinary capabilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The C-grade classification refers to malevolent ghasts. Malevolent ghasts have developed the capacity to infiltrate and influence a person’s mind as well as manipulate external objects. Ghasts must be eradicated once discovered. Furthermore, ghasts also possess cognitive functions and the ability to speak just like any other human out there.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The ghost that we had just interacted with was mumbling incoherently at all times, and that tells us that it probably isn’t a C-ranked ghast. If we use the proper nomenclature, it would either be a pseudo-ghast or a vengeful apparition at best.” Arthis pondered, “This means… she’s never truly mastered the use of the shard of King Yanluo’s Seal. She won’t be too formidable. It should probably be well within your abilities to subdue her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s not just a mere ‘probability’.” Qin Ye continued to fidget with his phone. Several seconds later, he continued with a categorical declaration, “It’s a ‘certainty’.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She didn’t react in the slightest despite my sudden interjection earlier. Her tone of voice didn’t even change one bit. This proves that she has no capacity for conscious thought at all. Her existence is purely built on her obsession, and she simply wants the death of the Wang family. Nothing else forms part of her considerations.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He furrowed his brows slightly and paused for several more seconds before he continued, “But… have you considered this - her abilities are far from strong, yet she dares to provoke and challenge a fully fledged Emissary of Hell. She even possesses the ability to make a move against Wang Chenghao in broad daylight. This is well beyond the abilities of a mere apparition.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arthis was silent. It took her some moments before she finally responded in a calm voice, “Do you know something… Humans are interesting creatures after all.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’d really like to know something. I’d witnessed you fawning over Granny Meng and currying favor with her earlier at the Naraka Bridge; previously, your life was centered around the tenet of mere survival and getting by; and yet, now, you’re courageously confronting the troublemaking ghost with no qualms at all - even spinning silk from cocoons and painstakingly investigating the matter. Which exactly is the real you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There had only been mere seconds from the time when Qin Ye received the phone call to the time when he started buffeting the evil ghost with probative questions. Yet, despite the short interval of time he had to make preparations, he had made the most appropriate choice by asking what seemed like a completely innocuous set of questions in order to achieve the answer that they so desired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They were now able to assess the ghost’s true abilities!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arthis immediately understood what Qin Ye was trying to achieve as soon as he had embarked on his line of questioning. One old man, and one old ghost, were able to cooperate surprisingly seamlessly without any form of prior coordination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“...Please be precise with your words. What do you mean by fawning and currying favour? It was a tactical retreat in the circumstances.” Qin Ye continued bluntly, “Truth be told, I’d very much like to continue cruising along and doing just enough to get by, but there’s no longer any way of doing so without confronting the problem in front of me right now. So, …”</span></p>

The recent surge in reports of paranormal activities on online forums and social media, coupled with the government’s lack of intervention meant that the entire county was devoid of life as soon as the clock struck 6 p.m. The only trace of civilization were the dim yellowish glows of the street lamps lining the roads.</span></p>

From time to time, Qin Ye could see some people, both young and old, drifting by the roads that should have otherwise been sparse and empty. However, the strangest thing was that these pedestrians were only dressed in green or white, or a mix of both. No other colours could be seen on their bodies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In fact, one could make out wisps of smoke emanating from their bodies. If one took a closer look, he would realize that the feet of these pedestrians never once touched the ground. They acted like puppets, monotonously repeating the same actions that they had habitually done in their previous life, over and over again.</span></p>

That’s why they’re simply drifting about aimlessly.” Arthis explained in a hushed voice, “If a magistrate doesn’t appear very soon, the mortal realm is going to experience a great collapse.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye nodded his head. Rain continued to wash off the edges of his paper umbrella, forming a neat curtain of water in front of him as he continued to march towards his destination. Wherever he went, the wandering spirits would bow down and prostrate to him, paying their respects to him with trembling as though he were an emperor walking among his palace servants.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no logical thought process behind these actions. They were merely instinctual.</span></p>

Qin Ye glanced in the direction of the Hyatt Corporation, “The heavens are furious, and Hell’s gate is open. Do you really think you can get out of this predicament alive?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was an incident that would determine whether he lived or died three days later. He would very much have liked to explore an amicable solution to this problem. But, now that he was forced into a corner, anyone in his shoes would go for broke.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Urgh….uuuuurrrgghhhhh….”</span></p>

He saw wandering spirits drifting everywhere within the county. By Hell’s dictum, all ghostly rabble must disperse. Not a single spirit dared to even draw close to an official Emissary of Hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The county was not large by any means, and Qin Ye found his way to the entrance to the Hyatt Corporation building very soon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it was only a small five-story building, it was still considered a very conspicuous existence within the county. This was a building that had been erected in the 2000’s, and it was already showing signs of its age. Just then, the main door that should have been locked tight was silently opened. Faint yellowing light glowed from within. It looked almost as though the gates of Hell had just been opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We Emissaries come from Hell to begin with.” Without hesitation, Qin Ye stepped right through the main door of the building.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye was immediately greeted with a grand reception desk. Yet, nobody was manning it. Flashes of lightning toggled the ambience of the main hall between light and dark. Qin Ye entered the elevator and pressed a button. Then, as soon as the doors shut, the lights in the elevator flickered and sizzled before going out completely. His eyes glanced around his surroundings sharply.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Someone’s here.</span></p>

Yet as soon as the door shut, his reflection in the mirror revealed that behind him… stood a woman with long dishevelled hair. She was wearing a long black dress and red high heels, and she hung her head lowly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just like that, she stood silently behind Qin Ye, almost as though she were his shadow!</span></p>

The strangest part about all of this was the fact that the elevator was still slowly ascending.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Bzzt…</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp; Just then, a peculiar sound could be heard in the pitch-black darkness of the elevator.</span></p>

His ears perked up and twitched slightly as though he were a prowling tiger. He regulated his breath and lowered its magnitude to a minimum.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One man, one ghost. Both were trying to sense each other in the dark.&nbsp;</span></p>

Simultaneously, a bright gleam of light cut through the darkness in the elevator like a bright shooting star.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was the bright gleam of a saber.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A glint of light shot through the air like a jade shooting star, and the saber shimmered like autumn frost.</span></p>

A miserable scream cried out. Then, with a click, the lights came back on once more, and the only person that could be seen in the lift’s mirrors was Qin Ye’s reflection. The lift door suddenly opened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The third floor.</span></p>

Qin Ye’s arm was wrapped tightly around the hilt of his saber, “Well then… do pardon my lack of manners.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Before he even finished speaking, the soul shackles around his waist began clattering. In the blink of an eye, the chains had already transformed into tens of chains and shot in all directions around him.</span></p>

With a massive crash, everything on the third floor, including the doors, desks and cabinets, were immediately shattered into pieces! That said, the hooks at the end of the chains didn’t penetrate the walls, and instead appeared to act as Qin Ye’s eyes. In just less than ten seconds, innumerable chains had already scattered across the entire floor, dividing the space into far smaller partitions as they continued to linger about menacingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Office paper scattered like confetti in the air.</span></p>

That said, where does she think she can run to? This building only has five floors. We can lock down each floor of the building systematically from the ground up. There’s a massive thunderstorm out there, and the evil ghost will most certainly perish if it goes out right now.”</span></p>

In fact, he was merely akin to a village leader in the netherworld. He didn’t possess any magical powers like the Anitya Hellguard or the Infernal Judges did. And apart from the low-grade implements such as the demonhead saber in his hands and the soul shackles around his waist, the only other thing that he could rely on was merely the privileges and benefits that were conferred upon all Emissaries of Hell.</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yama Rising is finally hitting the shelves! I'm absolutely stoked about this novel simply because of its sheer magnitude and epic proportions. There are elements of cultivation and levels and kingdom building, and everything is stretched to a massive scale concerning an entire realm. If you like horror elements, the story follows the protagonist as he embarks on various investigations uncovering the truth behind supernatural incidents. There are moments in this novel which would resonate strong...</p>
