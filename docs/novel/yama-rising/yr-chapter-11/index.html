The instakill had taken place in no more than three seconds, and the intense Yin energy that surrounded Qin Ye’s body began to dissipate into the surroundings. Five seconds later, Qin Ye had reverted to his original appearance, complete with his Hell’s Emissary robes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the might of the Sixfold Ghost Kings?” He stared in astonishment at his own hands. Just a few seconds ago, he had still been under the impression that there was no way he could have defeated Arakshasa at all. Yet, mere seconds later, he had actually defeated her with his own two hands?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The chasm between their strength was far too vast. In fact, it had been so vast it was over before he knew it had even begun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This... was like catching a mere Pikachu with a Masterball. &nbsp;That was way too easy…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye bent down to pick up the talisman-sealed ball. Shortly after picking it up, a resentful voice immediately echoed in his ears, “Kid, even though your body was possessed by a Sixfold Ghost King, you would never be able to defeat me with your meagre strength! I... have a proposition for you. If you let me go right now, I’ll forget that anything ever happened today.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha.” With a curt, inconclusive response, Qin Ye placed the talisman-sealed ball within his pocket indifferently.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Releasing her was an impossible proposition. What would happen if Arakshasa came back to life once more? Wouldn’t he have to spend the rest of his life in the mortal realm cowering in fear? He could be a bandit for a thousand days, but how was he to protect himself from bandits for that long?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even though it was dangerous to bring the ball back with him, he would nevertheless be in the best position to keep it in check and know if any changes occurred to it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To put things bluntly, he was simply afraid of dying.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Anyone who gets in the way of this young master’s survival are heretics!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Without any further interference from Arakshasa, the black butterfly that had initially been shattered and scattered into the surroundings coalesced once more and formed a black whirlwind, carrying Qin Ye straight back into the mortal realm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">……………………………………</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Several hours later. Two people sat frozen like statues at the table. Granny Meng’s physical body suddenly disintegrated into ash and dissipated into the surroundings, leaving nothing more than the ancient oil lamp that she had used for the netherworld odyssey. Shortly thereafter, Qin Ye’s body trembled, and he opened his eyes once more, gasping for breath.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haa…haa…” Like a victim of drowning who had just regained consciousness, Qin Ye touched his chest and checked that his heart was still beating. His limbs were cold and chilly. It felt as though he had just resurrected from the dead.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It seems like he should never visit the netherworld with his current abilities. Otherwise, he might not even make it through the skeletal bridge…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Cockadoodledoo!!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;He was back within the county, and a neighbour’s chicken had just crowed. As the rooster declared the onset of daybreak, a golden sheen of light shone softly through the window. Dawn had just covered the lands with a warm golden sheen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye could feel the warmth of life creep back into his body. However, he lay where he was, gently massaging his temples as he delved deep into his own thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It’s changed. Everything has changed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had already changed, while the rest of the mortal realm was on the brink of a great upheaval. He had already found some answers to the questions bogging down his mind. Why did the school make such announcements? Why were the forums filled with posts reporting supernatural activities? Yet, despite the answers he already had, the road ahead was still fraught with uncertainty. He knew that the first thing he had to do was to organise his thoughts and be clear-headed. Otherwise, he would only become more and more susceptible to external influences as the chaotic changes around began to buffet him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“First of all, I can’t expose my identity.” He poured himself a cup of herbal tea as he muttered to himself, “The evil spirits of Hell are hiding out in the mortal realm. In other words, they are now no different from mere criminals. And what are criminals most afraid of?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The answer was self-evident:&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The law.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He tossed his head up and looked despairingly at the roof, “And I am none other than an agent of the law; the embodiment of justice. As soon as my identity is exposed, I will most certainly be doomed to die a horrible death. Furthermore, my greatest source of security, the Sixfold Ghost King Summoning Scroll, has already been expended. Yet the only thing I got in return is a stupid, useless pokeball! Which I don’t even dare to discard!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">No matter how he looked at the situation, it seemed completely hopeless to him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had been enjoying life with wanton abandon and little preparation for the future. Yet, that beautiful dream of his had just been shattered to pieces in the span of a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I’m really walking along a tightrope here… But all of this doesn’t take into account the fact that I can’t die…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Perhaps...I could just ignore these things after all?&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Granny Meng has departed, so the three-day limit has already been written off. If I simply ignore it... would I be able to live on as I’d done before?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Fool.” Arakshasa’s cold voice echoed within his ears. “Even someone like Granny Meng isn’t able to determine when a person’s life draws to an end. Life and death are part of the natural order of things governed by one of the three primordial treasures, the Book of Life and Death. Even if Ksitigarbha’s enlightenment has shattered the three primordial treasures into innumerable pieces and weakened its abilities, death would only be delayed, never abolished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“... That’s a rich statement coming from you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arakshasa gnashed her teeth as she continued, “Your records show that you have only three days left within the mortal realm. Hell’s collapse would affect people like you with ‘dual-citizenship’, as your existence straddles both realms. The netherworld represents Yin, while the mortal realm represents Yang. As soon as either realm falls out of balance, your existence would immediately be threatened, even though you name was not originally in the Book of Life and Death.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She paused for a moment as she attempted to calm her voice, “Kid, my earlier offer still stands.
