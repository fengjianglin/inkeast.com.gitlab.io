 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These are also known as the three lamps…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as these three lamps… rather, the three fires from the lamps are extinguished, a person’s soul would leave their body and they would experience true death. A normal person should possess a vibrant flame in each of these lamps. If any one of the flames weakens or even flickers out, that person is commonly known to have too much Yin, or be plagued by Yin energy. If left unaddressed, that person will go on to encounter a series of unpleasant experiences, including a demotion, a pay cut, trouble with their career, etc.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If one’s Four Pillars of Destiny<span id="footnote-ref-bbda"><a href="#footnote-bbda">[1]</a></span> leans towards the Yin affinity, he would even begin to notice unusual, unclean occurrences. Other legends say that when one walks along the street at midnight, or even evenings if one walks along a secluded path, one should never turn his head to answer any person’s call, especially if the voice sounds unfamiliar. As soon as a person turns his head, the ghost will extinguish one of the fires on your shoulder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This is why the saying goes, “men light fires, but ghosts snuff flames”. These are popular sayings among the military as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Perhaps it was a result of Qin Ye having already completed the netherworld odyssey once, but all he had to do was to think about it in order to perceive the three lamps hovering about Wang Chenghao’s body. Currently, notwithstanding that only one day had lapsed since they last saw each other, the lamps hovering about his body were almost entirely extinguished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was by no means a good sign at all. The fact that a radiant, hot-blooded teenager could be reduced to such a tragic state in just one day meant that this ghost was definitely not to be underestimated!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The netherworld and the mortal realms are two entirely separate planes of existence. Ordinary spirits would never be able to affect a mortal to such an extent.” Qin Ye had hung the soul sphere on his bag like a cute ornament. Arthis cautiously added, “I had once assumed a post in the mortal realm for a hundred years as well. Those entities depicted in mortal horror films, such as Sadako, Churenmei and Jason are all ghosts that are at least of the fifty-year grade.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Right now, I can already say with utmost certainty that the ghost we’re dealing with has obtained the shard of King Yanluo’s Seal not more than half a year ago. Otherwise, a mere mortal like your friend would already have perished.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is good news for you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye nodded his head as he looked at the dazed Wang Chenghao. Then, just as Wang Chenghao began to break out in cold sweat once more, Qin Ye began to speak placidly, “How did you discover it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Chenghao bit down on his lower lip, switched on his phone and showed Qin Ye the photograph that had mysteriously appeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His gaze lingered on Qin Ye, scrutinizing every expression on his face. When Qin Ye returned Wang Chenghao’s phone, and before he could even begin speaking, Wang Chenghao immediately grabbed hold of Qin Ye’s arm tightly and pleaded with a trembling voice, “Previously… I’m sorry for all I’ve done to you previously! I’ll never do it again… please… please save me just this once!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was a towering, well-built teenager who had habitually flaunted his endowment of strength in front of others. Yet, his feet were currently ostensibly weak and limp, and it was clear from the scars on his lips just how much he had bitten down on them last night. If not for the fact that he was on a public street right now, he might already have knelt down to beg Qin Ye for help. If their other classmates could see how Wang Chenghao was clinging on to Qin Ye like an ornamental brooch and pleading for his help, they might very well find themselves completely flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s speak somewhere else.” Qin Ye lifted his head as he responded resolutely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon Qin Ye finished speaking, Wang Chenghao dragged him off his bicycle, “Let’s go… you haven’t had breakfast, right? It’s my treat! I’ll buy you anything you want! And just leave your bicycle here. Once we get back, I’ll give you a Pinarello!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two students hailed a taxi. As soon as they hopped on, Arthis mocked, “Mercy? That’s an emotion only the weak possess.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you think I’ll actually have such useless feelings for someone who has only crossed paths with me for less than three years?” Qin Ye gazed out of the window as he responded placidly, “He’s no more than a sojourner in my life. That said, since this matter implicates him, it’s… convenient to have his help.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two students went straight to a small shop within the county town that was hailed by all high school students to be a “dating paradise”. This shop’s design was clearly inspired by various popular anime series. Even though the shop had been standing for more than ten years now, it had managed to keep prices low and maintain the quality of its products. Most importantly, the seating within this cafe was cleverly designed in booths, and the privacy offered attracted many couples, especially those who were in their early days of courtship.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Once they sat down, Wang Chenghao handed the menu over to Qin Ye, currying favour with him, “Feel free to order whatever you like.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye ordered an assortment of deep-fried skewers and a cold beverage. It was early in the morning, and the shop was not too busy yet. Naturally, the food that they had ordered arrived promptly. Qin Ye took a sip out of his iced citrus tea, “Tell me more about it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">His comment came out naturally, yet seemed somewhat arrogant at the same time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye’s disposition was clearly different from that which he displayed when he was in school. However, Wang Chenghao didn’t find anything wrong with this. His hands were wrapped tightly around the milk tea in his hands, while his eyes were quivering and filled with fear. It took him several deep breaths before he finally managed to organize his thoughts and explain the situation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">With a trembling voice, Wang Chenghao began, “Did you notice this - I’ve been eating at school everyday over the last few months?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye thought about it before nodding slightly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wang Chenghao shrank back slightly as he muttered, “This is because… the food at home has become completely inedible! I don’t know when exactly this began, but my dad has taken a liking to raw food in recent times. He first started by taking a fancy to Japanese food, and I welcomed its freshness. H-however, his condition began to worsen like an illness! Roasts, steaks, and the like - he began to lean towards the rarer side of things. From medium-well to medium, then to rare… and then finally to blue-rare<span id="footnote-ref-97e7"><a href="#footnote-97e7">[2]</a></span>.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All the meat at home is completely bloody and raw when you bite into it! It’s completely inedible! And that’s not all. My dad has also become very strange. Over the last ten days or so, I began to detect a very strong stench of cologne on his body. But… but the strangest part is that he had never worn cologne ever before! That’s right… that’s right! Since last week, my dad has even stopped eating rice altogether!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">These were things that could ordinarily be attributed to nothing more than mere quirks and idiosyncrasies. However, under the influence of Wang Chenghao’s paranoia, he began to string them all together and pour out his heart.</span></p>

After all, I’d only found it somewhat peculiar, but nothing went overboard. Until last night… last night…” His body began trembling uncontrollably as he gripped tightly to Qin Ye’s hands. His hands were already covered with sweat, “I’d clearly locked the door to my room, yet that woman was there, sitting at the foot of my bed at three in the morning! When she stepped out, she even left a trail of bloody footprints! F-furthermore…”</span></p>

What we do know is that Wang Chenghao’s father is the key to unlocking this mystery. He is most certainly dead. However, it is only his soul that is dead. His body still remains alive.

Whether that person died a violent death, or an unjust death, or something completely different altogether, it is invariably their pre-death obsession that keeps their spirit around and prevents them from moving on. Over time, these spirits turn into evil ghosts. When that happens, you can be certain that every single abnormality or peculiarity with the location or person it haunts can somehow be explained by the ghost’s obsession in its previous life. This is because ghosts will instinctively repeat their obsessions after death.</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yama Rising is finally hitting the shelves! I'm absolutely stoked about this novel simply because of its sheer magnitude and epic proportions. There are elements of cultivation and levels and kingdom building, and everything is stretched to a massive scale concerning an entire realm. If you like horror elements, the story follows the protagonist as he embarks on various investigations uncovering the truth behind supernatural incidents. There are moments in this novel which would resonate strong...</p>
