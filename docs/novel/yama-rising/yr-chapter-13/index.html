She was presumably adjusting her emotions and organising her thoughts. After a long pause, the soul sphere shifted slightly once more. Yet, before she could speak her mind, Qin Ye immediately quipped as he continued to massage his temples, “Arakshasa is far too much of a tongue-twister. For convenience sake, I’ll henceforth call you Arti, alright? Your full name shall be Arthis Minithel. It’s catchy, clear and easy to remember. And it’s even got international influences. What do you think?”</span></p>

Then, drawing a deep breath, she continued, “The main reason why this spirit is important has very much to do with you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A person who has consumed the fungus of aeons is immortal. His name no longer exists in the Book of Life and Death, and his existence straddles both the mortal realm and the netherworld. But by the same token, as soon as the balance between the realms have gone awry, you will surely die.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She continued indistinctly, “These situations should never happen in the first place. However, who could have expected that Ksitigarbha would actually fulfil his great ambitions? The only way in which you can continue surviving is to locate the first shard of one of the primordial treasures. That said, have you thought about this before…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She lowered her voice, before uttering each of the following words with pristine clarity, “Once you locate the first shard, you… will never be able to stop.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What do you mean by that…” Before Qin Ye could finish his sentence, his mind was suddenly struck with a revelation, and he quietened down completely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">I won’t be able to stop...that’s right! So that’s how it is!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He had to locate the first shard if he didn’t want to die. Yet, acquiring the first shard was also tantamount to striking the first note of the netherworldly overture. Once it begins… no one would be able to make it stop again!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After he located the first shard, he would immediately be pointed to the second shard, and the owner of the second shard would also be pointed to his existence. Then, when he obtained the second shard, the second shard would communicate with the third, and so on and so forth. At that time, regardless of whether he liked it or not, there would be no way of extricating himself from the vicious cycle any longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was an infinitely occurring loop!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arthis’ voice softened somewhat, “Furthermore… each and every shard of the primordial treasures are filled with boundless Yin energy. Any ghostly existence that lays hold of it - even one or two year ghosts, would find their strength amplified and comparable with a ten or twenty year ghost respectively. Kid… you’d better pray hard right now. If you’re unlucky and the owner of the first shard is already a malevolent ghast that is stronger than a D-Grade ghost, then… you will still be doomed to die three days from now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye remained silent. Instead, he shut his eyes and began to deliberate his options carefully. His fingers tapped rhythmically on the table, and the taps echoed crisply throughout the cold corners of his little home.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was like an urn filled with parasites of all sorts, and each of these parasites was given a shard of a primordial treasure - it was a survival of the fittest! As long as one was given a shard, it would have to fight to the death, whether it liked it or not!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">There was no escape.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">So…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The first mover has an advantage.” He opened his eyes, and a murderous intent flickered across the depths of his eyes. Incidentally, he had uttered this phrase at the exact same time that Arthis did.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Since there’s no longer any room for retreat, then there’s no point contemplating retreat itself. Either you die, or they die.” As a Judge who had been dishonoured for committing the most heinous of crimes, Arthis’ heart was naturally cold as ice. She glanced at Qin Ye, “I’d never thought that we would see eye to eye on this. Don’t worry, since we’re already bound by the blood oath, I will never stand idly by as I watch you die. Furthermore, I’d caught a glimpse of this Yin spirit earlier when I was in Hell, and I could sense that the scent of the primordial treasure shard isn’t too strong. You should count your lucky stars. The ghost manipulating him must not have obtained the shard too long ago.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Qin Ye nodded his head as he glanced at his phone once more. It was already 7.10 a.m.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Since the first mover has an advantage; and since there’s no way to summon the soul in the day, we’ll start with my classmate, Wang Chenghao!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If his first opponent didn’t perish in three days’ time, Qin Ye would be following in Granny Meng’s footsteps very shortly.</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as Qin Ye was embarking on the netherworld odyssey, a tall, well-built teenager living in the most upscale neighbourhood in Clear Creek County was lying on his bed with a frown on his face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was deep in slumber. Even though it was summer, his home was nevertheless equipped with a state-of-the-art central air conditioning system fully equipped with air-refreshing technology. One such system would cost upwards of RMB 100,000.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The home of Wang Zemin, the richest man in Clear Creek County, was located within the Canglan Neighbourhood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">All of the houses in this neighbourhood were detached villas. If one peered out of the windows of any of these villas, they would be blown away by a magnificent, unobstructed view of the Daba Mountain Range that stretched on for miles and miles on end. When the night breeze came, it would carry the gentle, rustling sounds of the bamboo forests on the mountains with it, bringing tranquility to the mind and easing the heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was also a very green neighbourhood. Naturally, the price of homes in this neighbourhood was comparable with the top neighbourhoods within the entire province. The exclusivity of this region also explained why there were only three or four villas in this location. There was even a pleasant looking forest not far away. The only drawback was that in the dead of the night, and under the dim glow of the moon, the forest gloom appeared somewhat eerie and creepy.</span></p>

A tall, burly eighteen-years-old lad was on the brink of screaming his lungs out.</span></p>

Wang Chenghao could no longer suppress the fear welling up in the depths of his heart and screamed out loud as he retreated more than a meter from the door.</span></p>

He wanted so much to flee from the only piece of wood separating him and the source of his terror. However, what he dreaded even more was the possibility that the door would immediately be opened as soon as he left. He wanted to secure the door to his room, yet this meant that he had to remain uncomfortably close to the very source of his terror itself.</span></p>

Finally, at 5 a.m., a cock crowed in the distance, and the knocking sounds finally ceased.</span></p>

Even though it was 5 a.m., and even though the knocking sounds had ceased, the sky was nevertheless still dark. Even in summer, the first glow of dawn came at approximately 5.30 a.m. Wang Chenghao silently prepared some cash with him as he continued to stare transfixed at the time on his phone. As soon as the clock struck 5.30 a.m., he immediately charged out of the front door like a madman.</span></p>

Even though there was nobody on the streets right now; and even though the air of the summer morning was far colder and damper than it was at home, he still felt as though he had finally shaken off the niggling source of fear that had badgered him for the entire night.</span></p>

 <p>Hey everyone!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yama Rising is finally hitting the shelves! I'm absolutely stoked about this novel simply because of its sheer magnitude and epic proportions. There are elements of cultivation and levels and kingdom building, and everything is stretched to a massive scale concerning an entire realm. If you like horror elements, the story follows the protagonist as he embarks on various investigations uncovering the truth behind supernatural incidents. There are moments in this novel which would resonate strong...</p>
