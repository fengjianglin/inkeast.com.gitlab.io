<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>"It's getting late." Yan Ruhuo looked out the window, then disappeared into a room, and returned with a bowl of porridge. “Eat something first, Qingyu. I’ll help you find your friends tomorrow.”</p>
 <p>"Thank you." Gu Qingyu was getting hungry as well, and took the porridge graciously. Ye Jin must be looking for her, there was no way that he would leave her alone, all by herself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin, Qi Yan, Mo Bai, Qi Yichen, Xie Zang, Murong Zuoyu, Xiao Qi, and Yan Zun. None of them would leave her behind.</p>
 <p>The porridge made by Yan Ruhuo was very delicious. She smacked her lips after finishing the porridge, and smiled at him. “Thank you, Brother Yan. Your cooking is really good.”</p>
 <p>He did not pay much attention to the way she addressed him, and he merely smiled softly at her praise. “Thank you for the compliment, Qingyu. It’s already getting late, do get some rest soon.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu nodded, laid down and snuggled into the covers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yan Ruhuo walked out of the room and closed the door gently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The storm continued, and every now and then, thunder claps would be mixed with the pattering of the rain as silver arcs of lightning danced through the sky. Her mind wandered back to Ye Jin and the others, wherever they are, they must be looking for her. Xian Di sounded like he knew Yan Zun, and that he was gathering the Spirit Gems to release Yan Zun from the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny. Does that mean that Xian Di was Yan Zun’s friend? If not, why would he help her travel to this time period to search for the Spirit Gems? Gu Qingyu sighed slightly and took out the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny from her sleeve. The jewel glowed faintly in the darkness, maybe that meant that Yan Zun was still in it. Then why wouldn’t he come out? Wait, is he avoiding Yan Ruhuo? Then what would happen if they meet? A mischievous grin spread across her face. She was tired, but she was not sleepy yet. So she closed her eyes and entered the spirit world.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was a barren wasteland, Yan Zun was not around. But she was not looking for him, she was looking for someone else. She may not know what had happened, but someone might. She closed her eyes gently, and after a while, a light appeared next to her. When she opened her eyes, a boy was standing in front of her. He bowed with his hand over his heart, “Master.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Abyss.” Gu Qingyu nodded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What are your orders?” Abyss asked with a smirk as he straightened. His youthful appearance really did not match his experience and age.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu also smiled and replied confidently, "You should know."</p>
 <p>"Are you asking about the others?” Abyss understood her, and when she nodded, he looked up and answered, “They’re here too.”</p>
 <p>“They’re here? If that’s the case, where are they?”</p>
 <p>“Each of you arrived at a different location, you are all separated right now.”</p>
 <p>Abyss seemed less grumpier than when she first met him. She nodded. “Okay, then where’s Yan Zun?”</p>
 <p>Abyss stiffened slightly at the mention of Yan Zun, and then he smiled. "Wasn’t he right in front of you just now?”</p>
 <p>“Right in front of me? You mean, he’s really Yan Zun?”</p>
 <p>Abyss said matter-of-factly, “Or who would he be? They were the same person after all.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu hesitated for a moment, and still said, "Yeah, but...they don’t look alike at all.”</p>
 <p>“That’s precisely why you’re here right? You have your answer.” Abyss returned her question without a hint of impatience.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu threw him a strange look. "Where is Xian Di?”"</p>
 <p>Abyss looked a little regretful this time. "I'm sorry, that is beyond me.”</p>
 <p>“Beyond?” She glanced at Abyss, he was not being snarky or difficult this time, there’s no reason for her to doubt his words. So she relented and asked something else, “Then do you know where the others are?”</p>
 <p>Abyss shook his head. "How would I know that kind of thing.”</p>
 <p>"Okay, thank you." She nodded and ended the conversation. Abyss disappeared, leaving her alone in the empty spirit world.</p>
 <p>She would be able to sleep easily, now that she knew that they were all here. But it would be difficult to find them, they could be anywhere. And where would the remaining two Spirit Gems be? Her heart jolted when she remembered what Yan Zun had said, "Actually, Xiqian has more than one Spirit Gem." &nbsp;Everything made sense now, they only found one during their visit to Xiqian because the other was hidden in this time instead. Therefore, the next Spirit Gem is at Xiqian in this time period. With a better direction and the next step planned out, Gu Qingyu gradually fell asleep.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>The next morning</strong></p>
 <p>The early morning sun shone through the window, and Gu Qingyu was awakened by a delicious smell in the air. She looked out the window, the rain had stopped and the sky was all clear. The bright sunny day was a stark contrast to the weather yesterday. She yawned and sat up. She felt much better, her strength was slowly returning and her headache had subsided. She slipped out of bed silently and walked out of the room to investigate the smell. She followed the smell to the kitchen. Yan Ruhuo was dressed in a white robe, similar to what he wore yesterday, and he was busy with something on the stove.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu walked up curiously, and he turned around at the sound of her footsteps. "Oh, you're awake. Good morning, Qingyu."</p>
 <p>"Yes, good morning, Brother Yan!" Gu Qingyu smiled and leaned over his shoulder to peek at the stove. "Are you making porridge?"</p>
 <p>"Ah, yes, because you're still recovering from a cold, it's better if you eat something light." Yan Ruhuo answered naturally, but also somewhat shyly, as he stirred the porridge.</p>
 <p>"Thank you for your trouble." Gu Qingyu nodded and hesitated, but still asked, "But what are you so nice to me?"</p>
 <p>His stirring paused as he tilted his head to look at her, a confused gleam in his eyes. "Do I need a reason to be nice to people?"</p>
 <p>Well, he has a point. He does not need a reason to be nice to people. But she would never hear that from Yan Zun. Gu Qingyu was a little dazed and then shook her head. "You are right, you don't need any reason or explanation."</p>
 <p>Yan Ruhuo resumed his stirring. After a while, he picked up a small plate, scooped a tiny bit of porridge, and poured it onto the plate. He brought the plate to his lips and took a small sip to test the taste. Then he put down the plate with a satisfied laugh, perhaps it tasted good. Then he prepared a bowl for her and set it on the table before doing the same for himself. "Here, go ahead."</p>
 <p>"Okay." She sat down at the table, picked up a spoon and slowly ate the porridge. It was delicious, each grain of rice melted in her mouth, several flavors such as meat, shrimp, and shiitake mushrooms were cleverly blended together in perfect harmony. Gu Qingyu sighed internally. She didn't know that Yan Zun was such a great cook. Yan Ruhuo sat beside her and ate the porridge. They ate in silence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Finally, when Yan Ruhuo finished eating, he wiped the corners of his mouth with his handkerchief and then smiled at Gu Qingyu slightly. "I will help you find your friends later."</p>
 <p>"Thank you so much!" Gu Qingyu immediately looked at him gratefully. "By the way, I want to ask you something."</p>
 <p>"Ask away, Qingyu."</p>
 <p>"Where is Xiqian?" Gu Qingyu asked tentatively. After all, the world in this time may be very different, it was better if she kept the details vague.</p>
 <p>Yan Ruhuo looked at her curiously. "Are you not from this area?"</p>
 <p>"Ah, yes, it's just that I lived elsewhere when I was younger. I've only came back recently." Gu Qingyu's smile was a little tense.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right then, she noticed some white-coloured thing behind him. Yan Ruzhuo was taken aback, then slightly tilted his body, a little cat jumped onto his shoulders with its furry tail swishing behind him.</p>
 <p>"This is...?" Gu Qingyu was a little curious, the cat was quite cute.</p>
 <p>"This is my divine beast, the White Tiger." Yan Ruhuo smiled. "Go west from here, and you will arrive at Xiqian in about a day."</p>
 <p>"Divine beast?" She's a divine beast herself, and that Yan Zun did call her his divine beast. Does that mean the cat that she was looking at was her in the past?</p>
 <p>"Yes." Yan Ruhuo stretched out his hand and gently rubbed the little white tiger's head very tenderly, "She's Yu'er, as in rain."</p>
 <p>"Yu'er?" That reminded her of the way Mo Bai calls her.</p>
 <p>"Well, she's adorable, isn't she?" &nbsp;Yan Ruhuo stroked the little white tiger on his shoulder with tenderness. It was really hard to believe that this person would turn into the bloodthirsty demon that she knew.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled. "Yes, she's really cute."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Okay, I'll go out and have a look first." Yan Ruhuo stood up.</p>
 <p>"Actually, it's fine." Gu Qingyu also stood up from her seat. "Thank you, Brother Yan, for your kind offer, but I think it would be better if I went to find them on my own instead. I would take my leave as well, thank you for your care during this short stay."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"But..." Yan Ruhuo hesitated, then shook his head, "No, Qingyu, you're still recovering."</p>
 <p>"It's okay, I already feel much better. And I'll just avoid vigorous activities." She shrugged, then bowed solemnly. "I am really grateful for your help, had you not found me, I might have died. You saved my life!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You don't have to be so polite..." He sighed and was going to continue, but Gu Qingyu had walked out already.</p>
 <p>"Goodbye, I'll see you later." Gu Qingyu waved at Yan Ruhuo and walked into the forest.</p>
