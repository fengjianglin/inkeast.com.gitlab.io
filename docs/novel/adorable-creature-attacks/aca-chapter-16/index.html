 <p><strong>Chapter 16: I became a man!?</strong></p>

 <p></p>
 <p><span style>When Gu Qingyu opened her eyes, she found herself lying in a bed, and a young man with a gentle and kind face was sitting at her side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Bai?” Gu Qingyu tried to sit up but Mo Bai gently pushed her back down on the bed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Gu, you were chosen by the Jewel of Desired Fate. You must be sensing some changes in your body.” Mo Bai smiled and continued, “Your body needs time to adjust, physically and mentally. Don’t move too much and take it slow for a few days.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, okay. I’m... I’m fine,” she said and sat up on the bed. Near her pillow lay the red rock, Jewel of Desired Fate, and surprisingly, she saw three familiar faces standing behind Mo Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai was a physician, so to see him first as she opened her eyes, was understandable. But she looked rather startled when Xiao Qi, Jia Qizhe and Qi Yichen appeared in her field of vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her initial response was to ask, “Did I faint?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The black-robed man entered the room before anyone could respond. “The Blood Jade’s power entered your body the moment you accepted it. That is why you went unconscious.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: small;">T/N: The rock is called Jewel of Desired Fate while Blood Jade is how it looks like.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was an alarming glimmer in Gu Qingyu’s eyes. She did not forget the ‘red rock’ he’d spoken of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are not to be alarmed. Nothing I do mean you any harm.” The black-robed man swung his sleeves. “Early tomorrow morning, you will go seek for a man named Murong Ranyue.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Her ears pricked. “Murong? Someone from the imperial clan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Precisely.” He nodded admittingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why him?” Gu Qingyu titled her head to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He is a reputed medical practitioner. You need something from him. A plant that possesses the ability to suppress the aura of the Jewel of Desired Fate,“ he explained.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Another doctor?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu quickly glanced at Mo Bai, “Don’t we have Mo Bai? Mo Bai is a highly experienced physician too!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What you’re looking for is a modified medicinal herb. No one but Murong Ranyue knows its formula.” The black robed man shrugged his shoulders. “He’s the most skilled in the arts of healing amongst the royalties in this country, but his weakness lies in combat. He’s currently residing in the capital, so it’ll be easy for you to find him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No——way——” Gu Qingyu drawled out the words. “But we just got out of there———”</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scorching sun blazed down on the parched earth, but Gu Qingyu was sweating a cold sweat. Her head was bent forward in deep contemplation, and trickles of sweat dropped down on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai, who walked next to her, glanced curiously at her occasionally. “Miss Gu, is everything okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmhm...” She wiped the sweat from her forehead. “I’m just trying to recall the precise agreement I made with that rock... And how we can get out safely from the capital again...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s what you’re worried about?” Jia Qizhe scoffed and pulled her in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nya?” Gu Qingyu looked at him with confusion all over her face. “That’s right.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Aren’t you just worried about being recognized by the people from home?” Jia Qizhe scoffed again. His hand emanated a blue light as he swiped it across her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Gu Qingyu noticed she was enveloped by the blue light emanating from his hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In dumbstruck silence, everyone present froze like ice statues and stared at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe slowly dropped his hand coming to rest at his side. He looked at her, up and down, admiringly, like he was seeing a fascinating work of art. “Mmhm... Not bad, Qingyu. Not bad at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu subconsciously lifted her hands and touched her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm, I don’t feel anything different... Why is everyone staring at me like I’m a freak?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She bent her head and looked down at her clothes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>...!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The light yellow dress she wore since morning had turned into a light purple men’s robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The light purple silken robe was elegant, embellished with elegant patterns and laced with exquisite embroidery of gold and silver threads.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mouth dropped down and her eyes widened, “Eeeh!?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She touched her hair. Her beautiful hairstyle which Xiao Qi gave her in the morning had changed into a men’s hairstyle, the same which Qi Yichen’s mentor had.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Male disguise, a typical escape ploy for females in dramas.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jia Qizhe... What a genius!&nbsp;</span></i></p>
