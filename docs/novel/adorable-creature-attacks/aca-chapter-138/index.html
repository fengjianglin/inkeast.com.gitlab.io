 <p>"Haha, sorry, I didn't mean it." Xie Zang laughed.</p>
 <p>At this moment, the door opened again. It was Murong Zuoyu.</p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger lifted her head from Ye Jin's arms. "Morning, Brother Murong!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes, good morning." Murong Zuoyu nodded and sat down.</p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger shook her head and growled at Ye Jin impatiently. "Put me down, I want to eat!"</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay." Ye Jin took out a soft mat and laid it out on an empty spot on the table, then gently set her on the mat. "Go ahead."</p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger roared as loudly as she could. “Oh! Then I won't hold back, time to devour everything! Bankrupt Brother Murong!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu furrowed his brows. Her comment, should he believe her, does worry him no matter his wealth. And he watched in horror as the tiny white tiger practically inhaled everything in her bowl. Every now and then, Ye Jin would add more food to her bowl as he watched her eat happily, he himself did not eat much. While she ate, Gu Qingyu thought about how she would deliver food to Qi Wan, before going to see Xian Di. They did plan to meet at noon, at the river where it all began.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Wow..." Qi Yichen was stunned from the side, "Brother Zhu, how is it the smaller you are, the more you can eat?" He genuinely thought that her appetite would decrease according to her size, but he did not expect that she would be able to eat so much. If Murong Zuoyu was having trouble keeping up with her appetite, would Hero Jia have trouble keeping up? Oh, poor Brother Jia. Gu Qingyu burped, and Qi Yichen turned to watch her, wishing that she might have had her fill. But she buried her face in her bowl again and kept eating. Qi Yichen was at a loss for word.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After a few more minutes, the tiny white tiger finally had her fill. She cleaned her face as she laid on the mat. "Hurry up and eat, we have to leave after this."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone unanimously looked at the leftovers on the table, each with a cringe on their face. Then the tiny white tiger curled up into a ball. "Wake me once you're done, I'm gonna nap for a bit." Their resignation turned to annoyance. All of a sudden, the bricks piled at the corner seemed very appealing.</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu clapped softly with a sigh. The door opened, and someone immediately walked up to clear the table and set the table with new dishes.</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen's eyes lit up. "Brother Murong! Oh, you are truly..."</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu quickly shushed him, then glanced at the tiny white tiger that was sleeping. He did not have anything else left. Qi Yichen nodded immediately as he stole a glance at Gu Qingyu. The tiny white tiger yawned lazily, her eyes narrowed slightly. Qi Yichen's heart dropped as he held his breath. But the tiny white tiger rolled over and continued to sleep. Murong Zuoyu exhaled and looked at Qi Yichen at the same time. Qi Yichen released his breath as well and patted his chest. It was precisely that exhalation that caught the tiny white tiger's attention. Her ears wiggled as she looked up with bleary eyes and a lazy meow followed, "Why is it so noisy?"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Xie Zang stared at Qi Yichen with wide eyes, he looked like he was going to kill him. Murong Zuoyu also glanced at Qi Yichen and the blade in his hand flashed for a second. Ye Jin looked at Gu Qingyu, smiled, and remained silent.</p>
 <p>"I...I'm a sinner...I will end myself..." Qi Yichen deeply regretted his decision as well.</p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger tilted her head and looked at the spread before her. "What happened? Why is there so much food? Could it be that I just had a dream of having breakfast?"</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu looked at Qi Yichen with an indifferent expression. "Death would be too easy. on you." Qi Yichen swallowed thickly, he agreed as well.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Just when Gu Qingyu was about to eat breakfast again, someone picked her up from the table and tucked her into their arms. "Xiao Yu'er, don't eat too much in the morning. You're gonna put on weight and get a stomach ache." Ye Jin rubbed the tiny white tiger's head.</p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger was still half-asleep and was a little confused. "Oh? I've eaten already?" Ye Jin sighed, he would like to know if she had her fill as well.</p>
 <p>As Gu Qingyu laid in Ye Jin's arms, she suddenly remembered that Qi Wan must not have eaten yet. He was still on bed-rest, so he could not join them for breakfast. She was planning to bring some food to him when Murong Zuoyu clarified with a faint smile, as if he had read her mind, "Someone has already brought breakfast to him."</p>
 <p>She nodded and looked up at Ye Jin. "Then can I..."</p>
 <p>"No, you can't visit him." Ye Jin answered before she could even finish her sentence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe~"</p>
 <p>"No way."</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe~ Zhezhe~"</p>
 <p>"Do not……"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhezhezhezhezhe~"</p>
 <p>Ye Jin helplessly held his forehead. "Well, only for a while."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately jumped up to the table happily, picked out a bit from each dish and piled it all on one plate. Then she held the plate with her teeth, hopped down to a chair, and to the ground before she left the room with a swing in her steps.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen sniffed. "Tsk, this sour smell in the air."</p>
 <p>Ye Jin glanced at Qi Yichen with a menacing look, and Qi Yichen shut up immediately.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu ran all the way to Qi Wan's room. Right before she could open the door, someone burst through the door and ran out of the room. It was Xiao Qi, she ran out of the room with her hands covering her face, the sound of her sobs echoed through the hallway. She did not see Gu Qingyu at all, and the door closed behind her with a loud bang. Gu Qingyu was a little confused and gently pushed open the door with her paw. Qi Wan inside did not lift his head and answered with his eyes still closed. "Miss, I should have told you before. My heart already belongs to Gu Qingyu. I cannot give you what is not mine."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's jaw dropped and the plate clattered to the ground, but the food remained on the plate. Qi Wan opened his eyes at the sound of the clattering ceramic and saw that it was Gu Qingyu at the door.</p>
 <p>"Boss..." Qi Wan said blankly.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was also a little embarrassed, she probably knew why Xiao Qi would leave in tears. She lowered her head slightly, picked up the plate again, and walked to Qi Wan's bed. She jumped up to his side, placed the plate next to his pillow, and just nudged it. She pretended that she did not hear anything.</p>
 <p>"For me?" Qi Wan was somewhat surprised.</p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger sat curled up beside Qi Wan and meowed softly, "Who else?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan immediately picked up the plate. "Thank you, Boss! I know you're the best!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned around and noticed the tray of food on the table. She was a little puzzled. "What about those?"</p>
 <p>"Ah, I didn't have much appetite just now." Qi Wan picked up a piece of cake and popped it into his mouth, savouring the flavour with each bite. "Hm, not bad."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at the cakes on the table, and then at the cakes on the plate. She was a little speechless. "Aren't these the same?"</p>
 <p>"I prefer to eat the one you brought." Qi Wan grinned.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger rolled her eyes. "Fine, enough. Are you better? We'll have to set off soon."</p>
 <p>"Where are we going?" Qi Wan sounded like he had no idea that they were leaving.</p>
 <p>"To the river."</p>
 <p>"To go after the Spirit Gem?" Qi Wan guessed.</p>
 <p>"Correct, good guess."</p>
 <p>"Okay, no problem." Qi Wan rubbed the tiny white tiger's head with a smile. "Of course I'm fine! Look at you, you're in even better shape than me!" And although he left that part unsaid, he still needed to protect her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger shook her head. "Then take your time, I'll be off first! We'll wait for you by the main gate."</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Qi Wan pinched the tiny white tiger's face. The tiny white tiger jumped out of the bed and ran towards the door. She did promise Ye Jin that she would not take too long, although would this be seen as too long? It would be terrible if Ye Jin got angry again.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Not long after she ran out of Qi Wan's room, a white robe appeared in front of her. Gu Qingyu looked up at Mo Bai.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er." He smiled slightly and greeted her. Gu Qingyu also nodded.</p>
 <p>As much as she had decided to put the past behind them, she still felt awkward around him, especially if it was just the two of them. Would Mo Bai feel the same way?</p>
 <p>Mo Bai seemed to have sensed her discomfort and sighed softly, "Yu'er, since everything is resolved, I'll be off first."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded again as she watched Mo Bai leave the mansion, completely alone. He did everything he could to try to make her happy, only to realise that she never wanted anything that he gave her. Because she wanted someone, someone that was not him, and she could not fit both of them in her heart. Just like how he could not fit anyone else in his heart, other than her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu sighed. Mo Bai was a really nice person as well, and if she could, she would split herself into pieces and just give each piece to each person. She was so deep in thought that she barely noticed that someone stood near her. He picked up with large warm hands, and a slightly cold voice came from behind her. "What are you looking at?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That surprised her and she immediately twisted around and saw Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>She denied with a firm shake. "Xiao Zhezhe! I haven't seen you for a few minutes but I miss you so much already!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Although it was obvious to him that she was just licking his boot, Ye Jin seemed to appreciate her effort. "Okay, Xiao Yu'er. It's about time, we should go."</p>
 <p>"Alright!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Jin held her as they walked to the main gate. Murong Zuoyu was already standing there, waiting for them in his usual purple robe.</p>
 <p>And Xie Zang was dressed in his trademark red chic robes as well. He turned around at the sound of Ye Jin's footstep and commented as he walked over with the tiny white tiger in his hands. But Xie Zang was not looking at them, he was talking about something behind them. "Oh, you're here?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The tiny white tiger mewed lazily, then turned around. Qi Wan was walking towards them as well. He greeted them with a smile. "Boss, am I quick enough?" His hair was now tied up into a high ponytail with a dark green ribbon, and he looked absolutely dashing.</p>
