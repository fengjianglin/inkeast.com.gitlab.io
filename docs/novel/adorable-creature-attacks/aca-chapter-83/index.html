 <p><em>Yeah, in such a big castle, where can that girl go?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu looked around. Qi Wan, Qi Yichen, Mo Bai ,and her were all the people in the lobby. At the same time, Jia Qizhe was slowly walking downstairs and behind him was Murong Zuoyu. Gu Qingyu lost interest in the results of their fight. She asked Jia Qizhe, "Did you see Xiao Qi?"</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe shook his head. "Why, isn't she in a group with Qi Wan?"</p>
 <p>"After the competition started, she walked off on her own." Qi Wan was also puzzled. "Should we look around?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, let's. Xie Zang is gone, there should not be any major threat, but there might still be weird switches and traps." Gu Qingyu walked towards the stairs anxiously. Jia Qizhe kept his pace behind Gu Qingyu. Gu Qingyu carefully sniffed the air, trying to catch Xiao Qi's scent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The trail continued up the stairs, which meant that Xiao Qi had gone through here. Gu Qingyu followed the scent trail and arrived at the roof.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Xiao Qi was there. She had her back turned towards Gu Qingyu, her hair fanned out and fluttered in the wind.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi?" Gu Qingyu called tentatively. Xiao Qi's back stiffened, and she turned around slowly.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu..." Xiao Qi smiled brightly at her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Where are you doing? Come here." Gu Qingyu said with a wave.</p>
 <p>On the surface, it looked like they were just chatting, but inside, Gu Qingyu could feel her heart pounding against her ribcage. For some reason, she was afraid.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi nodded and walked to Gu Qingyu's side obediently. She took Gu Qingyu's hand, her hand was cold. "Let's go, Xiao Yu."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded, and they walked downstairs together. Everyone was relieved once they saw the ladies walk down the stairs together.</p>
 <p>"It's getting late, please go and have a rest. There are a lot of rooms, and we will gather directly on the top floor tomorrow morning." Jia Qizhe's voice echoed through the lobby as he walked upstairs. "I'll go first, Xiao Yu'er."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and pulled Xiao Qi along. "Let's go too."</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi gripped her hand firmly and nodded. "Okay."</p>
 <p>"Good night everyone!" Gu Qingyu waved at everyone, opened a door casually, and walked in with Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>Closing the door, Gu Qingyu stared at Xiao Qi and squeezed her hand gently. "What happened? It feels... Xiao Qi, you're a little..."</p>
 <p>"I'm fine." Xiao Qi lowered her head. "Thank you, Xiao Yu."</p>
 <p>"No need to thank me, silly girl." Gu Qingyu rubbed Xiao Qi's head and tucked her in before lying down herself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>In the dead of night</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu tossed and turned, but she was just unable to fall asleep. After struggling against insomnia for a while, she stopped and listened closely. Xiao Qi's breathing was smooth and calm. She then slipped out from the covers, walked out of the room with light steps and closed the door with a small 'click'. She walked straight to the roof. As she came up the stairs, she realised she was not alone tonight. Jia Qizhe was there as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Why, can't sleep too?" Gu Qingyu smiled as she approached him, and stood right next to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Have you resolved whatever that's bothering her?" Jia Qizhe turned to her and asked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu sighed and shook her head. "No. Xiao Qi won't tell me a thing. I just hope it's nothing serious."</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan." Jia Qizhe stated. Although it was only two words, it made Gu Qingyu's dark eyes light up, as though she had just awoken from a dream. <em>Yeah, Qi Wan! I knew it was him!</em></p>
 <p>"In other words, the issue that's bothering Xiao Qi has to be related to Qi Wan!" Gu Qingyu nodded as she thought aloud.</p>
 <p>"Okay," He chuckled lightly. "Xiao Yu'er, you are so smart, you must have figured it out."</p>
 <p>She nodded. "I had an inkling, but I didn't want to think that way."</p>
 <p>"Hm." Jia Qizhe reached out and rubbed her head, "Xiao Yu'er, after we leave this castle, I will take you to a good place."</p>
 <p>"Huh?" She batted her eyelashes. "Where?"</p>
 <p>He gave her a mysterious smile. "It's a secret."</p>
 <p>"Fine, keep it to yourself." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and turned around, "I'm going downstairs, good night."</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a warm embrace pressed against her back. Jia Qizhe's arms were wrapped around her arms and his chin rested gently on her shoulder. "Good night." She blushed and fled immediately, Jia Qizhe's full-bellied laugh followed her. She returned to her room, laid down on her bed and out of habit, was about to visit the spirit world. But she suddenly remembered that Yan Zun was still resting, she gave up the idea and closed her eyes in frustration.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I had already gotten used to that ghost floating around.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>The next morning</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu opened her eyes, turned around, and found that Xiao Qi was standing in front of her bed.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi? What's wrong?" The sight of Xiao Qi in front of her bed had alarmed her and she jumped out of bed immediately.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi smiled, "I just wanted to wake you up."</p>
 <p>"Oh." Gu Qingyu adjusted her clothes and took Xiao Qi's hand. "Let's go."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Xiao Qi nodded and went out with Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>The pair made their way to the roof, but only Qi Wan was there, shivering in the wind. Qi Wan smiled and waved when he saw Gu Qingyu. "Good morning, Boss." He saw Gu Qingyu blinking and also nodded slightly at Xiao Qi. "Morning."</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi immediately blushed "G-Good morning." Looking at Xiao Qi, Gu Qingyu sighed secretly in her heart. <em>I really have to find time to talk to Qi Wan.</em></p>
 <p>The sound of footsteps came from behind, she turned around and there was Jia Qizhe, Mo Bai, Qi Yichen, and Murong Zuoyu.</p>
 <p>"Good morning, we'll head out after a meal." Gu Qingyu smiled at everyone, opened a nearby door. A table of delicious food appeared in everyone's eyes. This was what Xie Zang told Gu Qingyu before he left. If it were not for Xie Zang, Gu Qingyu thought that she would never have visited such an "ideal" castle in her lifetime.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan's jaw dropped to the floor. "Wow! So much food! It's almost..."</p>
 <p>With a snap, the fan in Qi Yichen's hand dropped as well.</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan, Qi Yichen, please close your chin. Pay attention to your image in public... ahem." Gu Qingyu reminded them.</p>
 <p>"Oh really, Boss. Then you should swallow all that drool..." Qi Wan pouted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen nodded approvingly. "There's even some on your clothes, Brother Zhu."</p>
 <p>"There is?" Gu Qingyu wiped her chin immediately. "Hey, there's nothing!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan and Qi Yichen laughed together.</p>
 <p><em>Boom!&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu pulled everyone into the room, leaving only Qi Yichen and Qi Wan at the door, and slammed the door in their faces.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan narrowed his eyes slightly. "Brother Qi, what should we do..."</p>
 <p>"At this moment of distress, I believe that we should unite in our shared suffering." Qi Yichen swallowed.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded and took Qi Yichen's hand with sparkling eyes. "Brother, you are right!"</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen: "...?"</p>
 <p>At this moment, the door opened with a tiny crack. Gu Qingyu stuck her head out and threw out a drumstick. "Finders keepers, sort it out between yourselves." She then shut the door again.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan and Qi Yichen looked at each other and immediately went after each other's throats.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Nice one, Xiao Yu'er." Jia Qizhe smiled gracefully. "Those two were such eyesores, I've wanted to do this to those two for a long time."</p>
 <p>"I don't mind throwing you out too." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Actually, you are an eyesore as well, Jia Qizhe."</p>
 <p>"Oh? Feel free to try." Jia Qizhe was completely unfazed. "If you can."</p>
 <p>"I really want to." Gu Qingyu filled her bowl lazily, then she asked out of curiosity, "Yes, Jia Qizhe and Brother Murong, who won yesterday?"</p>
 <p>"Do you still need to ask?" Jia Qizhe smirked. Gu Qingyu sighed.<em>&nbsp;As expected, it was Jia Qizhe.&nbsp;</em>However, his next sentence struck her like a bolt out of the blue. "Of course it was Mister Murong~"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu almost did a spit-take. Murong Zuoyu's face darkened at her surprised reaction. "Why, Brother Zhu does not believe in my ability?"</p>
 <p>"No, no, I definitely don't mean that!" Gu Qingyu swallowed the food immediately. "Brother Murong, you are awesome!"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, he's powerful and daring." Jia Qizhe almost sounded like he was laughing.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu laughed dryly a few times. "Oh, what's happened?"</p>
 <p>"Nothing." Murong Zuoyu looked at Jia Qizhe with a stone-cold face. Jia Qizhe also smiled, kept silent, and continued to eat.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Without Qi Wan and Qi Yichen, their meal was much quieter. The sudden silence was foreign and uncomfortable to Gu Qingyu, and for some reason, Murong Zuoyu seemed off. After eating, Gu Qingyu took the lead and walked out first. Qi Wan and Qi Yichen were still at each other's necks. She slowly picked up the forgotten drumstick. It was still warm, she gently blew away the dust and took a bite. "Hm, delicious!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan and Qi Yichen immediately stopped and looked at Gu Qingyu in disbelief together.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took another bite and Qi Wan immediately burst into tears. "Boss, stop eating!"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, it's all dirty! It's going to give you a stomachache!" Qi Yichen also cried, "Brother Zhu, throw it away!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Look at you both, poor things. Go inside, there's still some left."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What?" Qi Wan and Qi Yichen were both overjoyed, and immediately ran into the room.</p>
 <p>"It breaks my heart to see them like that!" Gu Qingyu covered her face.</p>
 <p>"And yet, who was the one that pushed them outside." Jia Qizhe smiled.</p>
 <p>"Yeah, who is it?" Gu Qingyu feigned ignorance. "There's a switch here. Quick, help me find it." She ran her hands along the wall.</p>
 <p>"Switch? Didn't Xie Zang tell you, Yu'er?" Mo Bai's gentle voice raised, but with a little doubt.</p>
 <p>"I forgot!" Gu Qingyu sounded as though she was about to cry. Mo Bai could only sigh at her reply.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>All’s well ends well. I’m glad that nothing happened to Xiao Qi. However, should you find yourself in emotional distress and might hurt yourself, please reach out to a loved one and/or someone you trust. Alternatively, you can also call various hotlines for help, such as the Good Samaritans. The specific number depends on your location in the world. Stay safe out there!</p>
