 <p>Ye Jin walked straight to his room with Gu Qingyu in his arms. He kicked the door open, walked in and closed the door in a fluid motion.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe, calm down..." Gu Qingyu swallowed nervously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, you know I'm on this ship. So why did you act so intimate with him?" Ye Jin placed her at the edge of his bed, anger and frustration was written all over his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I was wrong..." She could bury herself in the ground.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He grabbed a chair and sat across her. "What did you do that was wrong?"</p>
 <p>“I shouldn’t have hugged Qi Wan when you’re on the ship... " Gu Qingyu lowered her head. The temperature around them plummeted.</p>
 <p>"When I’m on the ship? With Qi Wan?" Ye Jin huffed at her response. "So Xiao Yu'er, you mean that if I'm not around, then you can hug and be all intimate with other men?"</p>
 <p>"No, no, no! That's not what I meant!" Gu Qingyu immediately looked up. <em>God! What have I said!</em></p>
 <p>"No?" Ye Jin's lips were curled, he seemed to be smiling, but he still looked angry.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe, just calm down..." She was grasping at straws. <em>It’s already bad when women get jealous, but that is nothing compared to when a man is jealous. But even then, that’s nowhere near comparable to when Ye Jin is jealous! That’s practically the end of the universe!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Jin nodded with a smirk. "How are you going to make up to me?"</p>
 <p>"Um..." She gulped before asking tentatively, "How do you want me to make up to you?"</p>
 <p>The smirk on his lip grew into a full smile. Then, he closed the distance between them as he crashed his lips against hers. Her eyes widened in surprise before they fluttered close. His lips were forceful and insistent at first, but it gradually slowed and softened as they pushed and pulled. It was akin to a sudden thunderstorm that eased to a comforting drizzle. His hand reached up and gently cupped her cheek. She relaxed into his touch, his hand was as warm as her burning cheeks. He tilted her head and deepened the kiss. Her left hand crawled up his neck while her right hand settled against his chest. She pulled him towards her and they fell back against the bed. Her fingers tangled in his long locks as he shifted above her, taking care to not press her hair. "Xiao Yu'er..." Between breaths, her name slipped from his lips in a husky whisper and she answered with a soft, breathy moan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>Bang! Bang! Bang!&nbsp;</em>A loud noise at the door broke the spell. Gu Qingyu almost jumped at the sound. Then, she recovered from her shock and tried to push him away. Ye Jin was frowning at the noise as he stopped and closed his eyes. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe?" She asked cautiously.</p>
 <p>"Shh." He held her gently. "Don't move."</p>
 <p>The banging on the door got louder, Qi Wan’s voice added to the cacophony. "Boss... Are you there, Boss? Boss! Ye Jin! I’m gonna kick this door down if you don’t open it in 3, 2..."</p>
 <p>Ye Jin suddenly got up and Gu Qingyu sat up. She watched as he walked over and yanked the door open.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan's stunned face appeared at the door. He flinched before he quickly scanned the room and found Gu Qingyu. "Boss! Are you okay?"</p>
 <p>"I..." Gu Qingyu looked up at him. "I'm fine..."</p>
 <p>"Boss, I just figured it out! This is both our fault! I can't let you take all the blame!" Qi Wan immediately bowed to her. His words rendered her speechless. She looked up, Ye Jin's face darkened again. She wanted to cry. <em>You're fueling the fire, boy!</em></p>
 <p>Qi Wan looked at Ye Jin with a serious look. “Although, to be totally honest, I don’t think either of us are at fault!"</p>
 <p>Ye Jin couldn’t care less about him, he walked directly to Gu Qingyu and sat down next to her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Er... Qi Wan, you can go." Gu Qingyu waved weakly at Qi Wan. <em>Obviously, Ye Jin cannot and should not be angered any further.</em></p>
 <p>Qi Wan shot Gu Qingyu with a worried look, before he stole a glance at Ye Jin. “Boss, is everything okay?"</p>
 <p>"Yes..." She nodded. Qi Wan then left the room reluctantly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Then, Xiao Zhezhe ..." Gu Qingyu carefully looked at Ye Jin. "You...are you... alright?"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, do you think I’m fine?" Ye Jin looked at Gu Qingyu with a smile.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry, &nbsp;Xiao Zhezhe." She reached over and touched his hand hesitantly. In an instant, her hand was wrapped in his, and their fingers intertwined.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe, it’s all my fault." Gu Qingyu lowered her head.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin held a soft gaze in his eyes as he looked at her. "Xiao Yu'er, do you think I will be angry with you?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu felt guilty when she thought about it.</p>
 <p>For her sake, Ye Jin tossed aside his sister and his powerful subordinates who had been loyal to him for many years. He gave them to her and allowed her to do whatever she wanted, but she...Even now, he still said that he was not angry with her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I shouldn't have hugged Qi Wan, I shouldn't have made you angry, I shouldn't..." The more she mulled over her guilt, the more words spilled out of her mouth. Soon, tears followed her words and she sobbed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin was taken aback by her tears, and he immediately wrapped his arms around her. "Don't cry, Xiao Yu'er. I’m sorry, please, don’t cry."</p>
 <p>"Wah! You are so pitiful, Xiao Zhezhe!" She wailed and cried even more.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin was speechless. <em>Are you actually crying for me, Xiao Yu'er?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu cried till she got tired and fell asleep in his arms. Ye Jin looked at the damp spot on his chest with a defeated smile. He ran his fingers along her hair, then gently tucked her into bed. He saw a wisp of red smoke in the air and the corners of his lips curled. "What, have you lost your patience, Yan Zun?"</p>
 <p>"Ye Jin, I’m warning you," Yan Zun's voice came, mixed with ruthlessness and anger. “Do not touch my people."</p>
 <p>"Then I do want to see how Yan Zun backs those words up." Ye Jin laughed nonchalantly. After that, the red smoke disappeared. Before Ye Jin could leave, sharp pain surged through his body. It was the Frost Poison, again. He gritted his teeth, and collapsed onto the bed.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu woke up in a daze, and stared up at the ceiling. <em>The bed seemed to be swaying a little, why? Oh right, I’m on a ship now. I was crying in Ye Jin’s arms... and, by the look of things, I fell asleep.&nbsp;</em>She rolled over, and she was suddenly staring at Ye Jin’s face. They were so close that her nose almost brushed against him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even when he was asleep, he was so enchanted and enchanting, as if capturing her soul. She couldn't help reaching out and pinched his face gently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Wow! It's actually pretty soft!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>His features remained still, it seemed like he was still fast asleep. So she continued her ministrations and caressed his surprisingly soft cheeks. Just as she sighed, Ye Jin mumbled dreamily, "Xiao Yu'er, does it feel good?"</p>
 <p>She flinched and looked up, her gaze met with Ye Jin's beautiful eyes.</p>
 <p>Her hand stopped stiffly on Ye Jin's face, not knowing whether she should continue or put it down.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu gulped.<em>&nbsp;I actually do want to stroke his face a few more times...</em></p>
 <p>Before she could react, she was pressed into his chest. Her hands were gently held by him and his enchanting voice came from above her head. "Xiao Yu'er, if you like, you can touch it anytime.</p>
 <p>Colour burst across her face. "Xiao Zhezhe ..."</p>
 <p>"Yes?"</p>
 <p>"I-I'm hungry!" Gu Qingyu stuttered.</p>
 <p>"Okay, let's go for lunch." Ye Jin smiled and got up, the thick blanket slipped down his body, and his smooth hair fell down like a waterfall and gently swept across her face, making her feel even more flustered. His collar was slightly open, revealing the contours along the base of his neck and his collarbone.</p>
 <p>"Why, Xiao Yu'er?" Ye Jin asked with a smile, "Stunned by my good looks?"</p>
 <p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Gu Qingyu said with a blush and immediately got up to straighten her clothes.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu and Ye Jin walked out the room together, Xiao Qi was standing at the door.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi?" Gu Qingyu was stunned. "What's wrong?"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu, I, I, I came to call you to eat..." Xiao Qi's face was flushed, she lowered her head and stuttered, "I-It's already a-a-afternoon."</p>
 <p><em>It's already afternoon? No wonder I am so hungry...</em></p>
 <p>"Oh, okay." Gu Qingyu nodded. "Thank you!"</p>
 <p>"Come on, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin beckoned with a smile.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and took Xiao Qi's hand. "Come, Xiao Qi, let's go together!"</p>
 <p>"Eh... Xiao Yu..." Xiao Qi raised her head, barely keeping up with Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>After lunch</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu and Ye Jin parted ways and she went for a walk with Xiao Qi on the deck. Along the way, Xiao Qi's face was still red. Gu Qingyu wondered, but did not ask much. Finally, after Xiao Qi glanced at Gu Qingyu for a few times, she stuttered, "Xiao, Xiao Yu..."</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu turned to look at Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>"That...um...I..."</p>
 <p>"Spit it out, no need to be so lady-like around me!" Gu Qingyu said readily.</p>
 <p><em>Being lady-like?</em></p>
 <p>Xiao Qi twitched her lips, and she was no longer restrained. She asked boldly, despite her flushed face. "Xiao Yu, have you two done the deed?"</p>
 <p>"We? What's the matter..." Gu Qingyu murmured doubtfully before she realized that she was referring to herself and Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>"Oh! That's the... oh!" Xiao Qi stomped, when she was about to reply, Gu Qingyu smacked her head lightly.</p>
 <p>"What's in your head every day? What happened to being a pure and lovely lady?" Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi retorted with a pout. "Xiao Yu, you told me not to pretend to be a lady!"</p>
 <p>"Ladies should keep their image at the right times!" Gu Qingyu flicked Xiao Qi's forehead again and walked forward.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi immediately followed, eager to hear more gossip. "So did you two..."</p>
 <p>"No." Gu Qingyu replied immediately, also feeling a blush creep up her face.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi's face immediately showed a disappointed expression. "Oh, and I waited so long..."</p>
 <p>"What did you just say?" Gu Qingyu turned around. "Wait?"</p>
 <p>"Well," Xiao Qi nodded. "I wanted to call you for lunch but I was afraid to disturb you two hahaha..."</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi, I think it's better for you to pretend to be a lady." Gu Qingyu sighed as she looked up. Murong Zuoyu was walking towards them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was dressed in a purple robe, his sword hanging on his waist. His hair was a little tousled by the sea breeze, but it better reflected his indifference and decisiveness. <em>Arrogant, cold, elegant; Dressed in purple; A sword that slashed through the heavens.</em></p>
 <p>"Brother Murong!" Gu Qingyu said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu nodded in response. He walked to Gu Qingyu's side. "Brother Zhu, I have something to discuss with you alone."</p>
