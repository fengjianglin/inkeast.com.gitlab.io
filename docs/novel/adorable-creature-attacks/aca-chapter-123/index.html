 <p>"Huh." Xian Di sneered and moved his finger gently, Qi Wan's ribbon immediately snapped and flopped to the ground as if all of its magic had been drained.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan's eyes sank but he was not going to give up. He gently tugged the remaining part of the ribbon and it returned into his sleeve.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"There's no way you're taking her, not when I'm around." Qi Wan narrowed his eyes slightly as magic swirled around him, waiting to burst.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xian Di did not seem fazed. "Then I will simply kill you first."</p>
 <p>"Hmph, big talk." Qi Wan snorted coldly. Just when he was about to strike, a bright blue light appeared behind Xian Di. Xian Di whipped around, black light shot out from his hand and he blocked the strike of blue. Gu Qingyu only felt a burst of joy. <em>Ye Jin! He's here!</em></p>
 <p>The blue light was from his sword, Ghost Howl. He raised the sword above his head and slashed down. Xian Di raised his head, tilted his body to the side and stretched out his arm. A shield of black light formed on his arm and took another blow from Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>"It's been a while, Shadow." Xian Di's expression was still indifferent.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin snorted coldly. "Really? Because I never want to see you again."</p>
 <p>As soon as Ye Jin finished his sentence, Xian Di vanished with a gust of wind. His disembodied voice echoed through the trees, "I will come for you soon, Gu Qingyu."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rubbed her eyes and looked at Ye Jin, and found Ye Jin was also staring at her. They stared at each other, in complete silence.</p>
 <p><em>I can hear your call, even if you say nothing; I can feel your languish, even if you did nothing.</em></p>
 <p><em>Qi Wan lowered his eyes and stepped back without a sound.</em></p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe." Gu Qingyu said, her voice was soft but clear.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin moved closer and pulled her into his arms.</p>
 <p>She was pressed into him as his arms wrapped around her tightly, as if he poured all of his yearning into her.</p>
 <p><em>I missed you so much. The happiest thing in the world is that when I am thinking of you, you were also thinking of me. The happiest thing in the world is simply two lovers embracing each other. I want to hold you, for you are my one and only in this world.</em></p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu also stretched out her hands and wrapped around Ye Jin.</p>
 <p><em>Can you hear how much I missed you? Of course you can, for I missed you as much as you have missed me.</em></p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, I can feel it." Ye Jin closed his eyes gently, "I can feel the beat of your heart... I can sense it, even when we were apart. But yesterday, for a short while, it disappeared. I couldn't feel a thing." Her heart started racing at that moment. He could feel everything about her, her life, her death, her recovery, her heartbeat. Everything about her.</p>
 <p>"I was so scared that you were gone." Ye Jin buried his face in the crook of her neck.</p>
 <p><em>But I couldn't find you anywhere. I searched everywhere that I could think of, but I could not find you. The world is just this big, why can't I find you anywhere? Every time I arrive at a new place, I become filled with hope, only to be disappointed again and again. Did you abandon me? Did you leave me behind? No, you would never do that. So something must have happened. All the more for me to find you. It was the only thing I can think of amidst the silence between us. Where are you, my dearest person?</em></p>
 <p>"I won't." Gu Qingyu choked a little.</p>
 <p><em>I will not leave you, no matter what.</em></p>
 <p><em>I felt you searching for me, everywhere.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin gently stroked her head."Let's go."</p>
 <p>"Yes." Gu Qingyu nodded and turned to Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan walked over with a smile, "Sheesh Boss, tone it down! Have some consideration for the singles!'</p>
 <p>"Hey, I pointed you in a good direction, but you didn't take that path. And now you're blaming me? You missed that ship." Gu Qingyu shrugged and mounted her horse. "Well, there's still another ship. Qi Yichen has probably recovered from his heartbreak by now, and he suits your tastes. Maybe consider him."</p>
 <p>"What the hell." Qi Wan rolled his eyes. "Do I look not straight to you?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at him with a puzzled look. "You certainly never thought of things in a straight line." Qi Wan was speechless.</p>
 <p>"Okay, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin looked at her with a smile. "I came here in such a hurry, I forgot to bring a horse."</p>
 <p>"Oh, what a coincidence, there's enough space for one on Qi Wan's horse." Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan with a smirk.</p>
 <p>"What?" Qi Wan blinked, his face innocent. "Boss, every time you smile like this, I know I'm going to get into some trouble."</p>
 <p>"Hm, very perceptive of you!" Gu Qing nodded and looked at Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>However, Ye Jin turned and hopped onto her horse instead. He settled behind her, his arms circled around her waist, and his chin rested on her shoulder. "Xiao Yu'er, this is just fine, let's go.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was dumbfounded. "Can I catch a break?"</p>
 <p>Her face turned scarlet in an instant. &nbsp;She tugged the reins gingerly and her horse trotted forward.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan sighed and kept up with them. "Oh, it takes skill to be a third wheel these days!" Gu Qingyu twisted her lips, but she dared not turn back. She sat ramrod straight, even her neck was stiff.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin obviously felt how tense she had become, he reached up and gently brushed her cheek. "Xiao Yu'er, are you still not used to me?"</p>
 <p>"No, it's not you, it's me... Um..." Gu Qingyu only knew that she was nervous and uncomfortable. Although she had always wanted to be with Ye Jin, she would get so shy and embarrassed when they were actually together. Alas, love was truly a complicated subject.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin's fingers were tangled in her hair, and he chuckled lightly. "It's okay, take your time."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu sped up, her breathing quickened.</p>
 <p>"Care to join as the fourth wheel?" Qi Wan leaned down and looked at his horse, who was chewing seeds with the leash in his mouth. The crunching sound was unsettling. The horse was frightened by him and frizzled as it trotted forward. Qi Wan rolled his eyes.</p>
 <p>"Where are we going?" Gu Qingyu finally remembered to ask.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was gobsmacked. "I thought you knew where you were going, Boss! I was following your lead!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu looked around, the scenery grew familiar. "We're almost at the Gu residence. Why don't I head back there while you two go meet up with Brother Murong?"</p>
 <p>"Boss, I think it would be better if you went in person~" Qi Wan started to analyze by example. "Look, for people who ran away from home, don't they usually return after accomplishing something?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah, but..." Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan doubtfully. "Are you and Ye Jin not enough?" <em>Both of them are top martial artists! And one of them is the elusive Shadow!</em></p>
 <p>"They don't know that~" Qi Wan nodded. "Over here, the only person with a proper reputation is Duke Murong Zuoyu. I think we ought to enlist his help at least, wouldn't you agree?"</p>
 <p>"Well, yes, then we'll go to the palace to find Murong Zuoyu." Gu Qingyu nodded and turned around. "What about the others?"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was close behind her. &nbsp;"They should arrive by night."</p>
 <p>"Alright! Let's mosey!" &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They stopped outside the gates leading to Dongxuan. Gu Qingyu gazed at the city before her and grew a little wistful. They had returned to where their story began. It felt like their story was coming to an end, and everything was circling to the beginning.</p>
 <p>Nothing has changed since she left. The flowers were still in bloom, and the grass was still lush and green. The trees were still thriving, and the streets were still full of people. Did anyone notice that she was away? Gu Qingyu couldn't help but look up at the sky and narrowed her eyes slightly.</p>
 <p>In the world where she came from, would Ran Ran mourn for her when she found that she died? And the hospital director, the department head, all of her colleagues, and all of her patients. Would they mourn for her? Would they even notice that she's not with them anymore?</p>
 <p>Qi Wan came over and patted her shoulder gently, maybe because he could understand how she felt. "Boss, at least a lot of people here care about you."</p>
 <p>Ye Jin also guessed what was on her mind and Qi Wan's word confirmed his thoughts. He dismounted and gently helped her off the horse. "Come on, Xiao Yu'er. Look ahead."</p>
 <p>"Yeah!" Gu Qingyu nodded and stood firm.</p>
 <p>The guard at the gates bowed respectfully as soon as he saw Gu Qingyu. "Third Miss of the Gu family!"</p>
 <p>"Yes." Gu Qingyu nodded. Some people still seemed to remember her.</p>
 <p>"Duke Zuoyu has ordered, if you are here, please go directly to the Duke's mansion to find him!" Another guard answered with a bow.</p>
 <p>"Duke Zuoyu's Mansion? Got it." Gu Qingyu nodded then faced Qi Wan and tilted her head. "Lead the way."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Qi Wan led them through the streets, and soon they arrived at a posh-looking mansion.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stared blankly at the door. "Wow, talk about impressive..."</p>
 <p>The person at the door was very excited when he saw Gu Qingyu, and declared with a bow. "Welcome home, Princess!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu felt the wind knocked out of her lungs. <em>What is going on this time?</em></p>
 <p>Ye Jin's face sank, and he narrowed his eyes unpleasantly. She knew that he was going to start spitting fireballs. She immediately tugged on his sleeve, and then smiled at the two people at the door. "You got the wrong person, but it's ok. I'm looking for Duke Zuoyu."</p>
 <p>"No, we did not get the wrong person." A man opened the door immediately, "Princess, please come in!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan also squinted slightly and sulked. <em>Come on, he could stand Ye Jin but Murong Zuoyu was also after his boss?</em></p>
 <p>"Qingyu." A familiar and cold voice sounded. Gu Qingyu looked up and saw Murong Zuoyu, who was in a purple robe and approached them from a distance. "Welcome back." There was a slight smile on his face, which breathed life and colour to his stone-cold features.</p>
 <p>"Thank you!" Gu Qingyu also smiled and nodded. "Brother Murong, long time no see!"</p>
