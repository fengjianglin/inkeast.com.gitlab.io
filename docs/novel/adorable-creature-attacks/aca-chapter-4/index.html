 <p><strong>Chapter 4: Divine Physician Mo</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style>T/N: Divine Physician(</span><i><span style>Shenyi</span></i><span style>/神医): A title, refers to an exceptionally skilled physician. Also a term of respect. </span><span style>Could be used for when an individual has high medical skills and knowledge, or ability to treat various kinds of illnesses.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Next day.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu rose up early in the morning, and dressed carefully in a lavender ancient-style chiffon dress, put her hair up in a simple hairstyle with a hairpin, then set out for the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for her excuse for leaving the manor, she had long since prepared one together with Xiao Qi. If someone happened to come looking for her, Xiao Qi would just tell them that she had left early this morning to practise her art skills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>With her Light Body Skill and her strong, nimble body, Gu Qingyu arrived safely at the foot of the mountain. She hid away her ears and tail before she entered a nearby village.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The villagers were unusually welcoming and friendly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She saw an elderly man walking past, and decided to ask him about the way up the mountain. “Are there any paths up the mountain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, but you might have trouble finding them... If you don’t mind, this ol’ man can show you the way,” said the elderly man with a laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu had an uneasy feeling, but she still answered with a cautious nod, “I’ll have to trouble you then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, not at all.” The elderly man chuckled and moved towards the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they walked for a bit, Gu Qingyu started to get the impression that the landscape behind them got stranger the more they walked.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Something is not right here!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why is there suddenly no path behind us? We definitely followed it here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She turned back around, only to find that the elderly man had mysteriously disappeared too!!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What——In——The——World?!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly she felt an unfamiliar skin touching her shoulder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nyaaaah!” Gu Qingyu screamed and turned around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Behind her stood a young man. He had a beautiful face with sharp features. His lips were rosy,&nbsp; and his teeth were white, glistening when he smiled. His long silky black hair touched his dark-cyan robe, so beautiful as if he was a deity descended from heaven.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You almost scared me to death!” Gu Qingyu held her hand to her chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“My apologies. Are you all right, miss?” asked the young man softly. The corners of his mouth rose into a small smile, a beautiful sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu shook her head. “I am... fine.” Her eyes glanced curiously behind him and asked, “Ehhh? How come the path appeared again??”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This mountain is known as the Illusory Cliffs. Those unfamiliar with the place are easily led astray by the monsters below, like evil spirits and demons. I, myself, am here because I’m in the need of a certain medicinal herb. I saw you on my way up, so thought I’d lend a hand. Do you need any help, m</span><span style>iss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes!” Gu Qingyu clung to him as if he was her last glimmer of hope getting somewhere on this mountain. “You're a kind man!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>She pondered for a moment, then asked, “...Um, I was wondering if you could also help me find a herb called Illusory Spiritgrass?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man glanced at the hands wrapped around his arm, he opened his mouth and closed it again. After a while, he asked curiously, “What are you planning to do with it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m getting it for a friend!” Gu Qingyu blurted out without thinking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Illusory Spiritgrass is the jewel of the Illusory Cliffs. It grows high up on the steep cliffs, and is very difficult to get hold of.” He shook his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu’s shoulders slumped and her head stayed down.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So Jia Qizhe was playing with me all this time... It sounds utterly impossible for me to find it! He clearly just doesn’t want to take me with him!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The young man let out a faint sigh when he spotted the downcast and unhappy expression on Gu Qingyu’s face. “Like you, I am also in search for the Illusory Spiritgrass, and I also happen to know where they grow. If you don’t mind, we could look for it together, miss. But whether we find it, it’ll have to depend on our luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sounds great!” Gu Qingyu nodded and followed him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Forget it! If we can’t find any, I’ll randomly just grab one of the plants around here. Jia Qizhe probably doesn’t even know the difference between grass or some weed!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu seemed to have forgotten something very important. Because for someone who had travelled back and forth the ends of the world, what possibly couldn’t he have seen yet?</span></p>
 <p><span style>As they walked further up the mountain, Gu Qingyu noticed that the trees and bushes closed the space behind them whenever they walked a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By the way...” Gu Qingyu finally broke the silence. “May I ask for your name, mister?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mister?” He seemed somewhat puzzled by the word, but he quickly replied, “My family name is Mo and my first name is Bai. Healing people is what I do and I live my life in seclusion on another mountain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: small;"><span style>T/N: Mister seems to be an unknown word for that era.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oooh! So it's Divine Physician Mo!” exclaimed Gu Qingyu and nodded understandingly. “My name is Gu Qingyu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Qingyu?” Mo Bai tilted his head just slightly, giving her a quizzical look. “The young lady from Gu Manor, who is known as willful and headstrong?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m really curious who started these rumours. How come even a lone and secluded hermit has caught wind of it!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Erm... about that... I...” She frankly didn’t know how to explain the rumours. Perhaps the Gu Qingyu of this world was truly as willful and headstrong as they say?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But having met you in person today, I’d say it’s merely just rumours.” Mo Bai chuckled and continued walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She finally let out a small sigh and followed behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moments later, they arrived at a steep cliff side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Standing here, close to the edge, Gu Qingyu suddenly felt like screaming at the top of her lungs. But she valiantly resisted the urge. Why? Because a handsome guy was right next to her...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re here.” Mo Bai stopped his pace, only a half step from the edge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu neared the edge, curiously gazing over, and looked down. Sure enough, she spotted some glowing grass.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To her own surprise, she didn’t feel as afraid of heights as she did back in her old world. Possibly one of the qualities of being a cat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I shall go down first. You can wait here for me unless something goes wrong.” Mo Bai took out a small piece of leaf from his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu answered with a nod, then tilted her head and looked at the leaf in his palm questioningly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai chanted softly under his breath as he tossed the leaf away. In the split-second the leaf touched the ground, it expanded and grew into a gigantic leaf.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stared bewildered at Mo Bai as he stepped on it. The gigantic leaf started to hover above the ground and then began gently descending down the cliff side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu watched him closely as he closed in the range, and with a single reach, the herb was effortlessly in his hands.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Isn’t this magic of his too much of a cheat?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stood there looking at the gigantic leaf with her mouth agape. Seeing Mo Bai coming back up so leisurely, her face filled with resignation. She silently mocked herself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why did I feel so thrilled when I could jump on roofs and leap over walls? It’s all just child’s play for these godly beings! To think I thought I was so special to have transmigrated into the mere body of a cat spirit...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Only a single stalk of Illusory Spiritgrass remained,” said Mo Bai remorsefully. “Although I am not sure about that cave over there, I sense it to be a monster’s den. It’s too risky, Miss Gu.” Mo Bai shook his head in regret. “I have a patient in wait, so I ought to return immediately... How about we come back another day?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That...” Gu Qingyu hesitated.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can only phantom all the schemes my relatives will set up for me after the competition tomorrow. Also, what should I do if Jia Qizhe decides to leave during the time period...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But it wouldn’t look good if I tried to steal the herb from him, especially when it’s for a patient. Moreover, this stalk was also harvested by him.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s just do as you say, thank you.” Gu Qingyu clenched her teeth and reminded herself that it was he who had brought her to this place in the first place. She decided to instead give that cave he mentioned a chance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai probed carefully, “The mountain roads are very dangerous. Will you allow me to escort you back, Miss Gu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu shook her head. “Thank you for your kindness, Young Master Mo. But I can continue on my own now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But...” Mo Bai tried to add something else, but he was quickly interrupted as Gu Qingyu pushed, pulled and butted him away with her.</span></p>
