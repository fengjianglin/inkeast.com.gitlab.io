 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“[Barrier]” Qi Yichen immediately took stand in front of Gu Qingyu. The fan in his hand responded to his chant and transformed into a white protective screen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Slash————</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe’s sword sliced deep into the black-clothed man’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...” The black-clothed man glared at Gu Qingyu grudgingly. His eyes were wide, his voice hoarse, and as his words turned into whispers, he fell weakly to the floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu was able to hear his last four words, “</span><i><span style>... can go to hell!</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wh-why is there someone out here trying to assassinate me... Could it be related to the Gu Qingyu of this world?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu couldn’t keep her eyes away from the lifeless body on the floor, staring at her with dead eyes. The scarlet blood was still flowing out of his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe wiped his sword as cooly as though blood had never stained it. “We planned to keep him alive for interrogation later. Looks like that’s impossible now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu glanced back at the dead body, then turned her gaze towards Jia Qizhe, almost frightened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingyu, do you have some bad blood with anyone out here?” asked Qi Yichen suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t...” she answered honestly. But she quickly became unsure... After all, she did not know the past memories of the former owner of this body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen smiled. “Qingyu, be more vigilant and careful in the future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmhm!” Gu Qingyu nodded. “So, I’ll see you two later? I can’t leave Xiao Qi waiting for too long.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, you should go.” Qi Yichen withdrew his fan.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu helped them closing the door and returned to her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Xiao Qi spotted Gu Qingyu walking through the door, she threw herself all the way from the bed. “Xiao Yu! Are you okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m good, nothing happened to me!” Gu Qingyu stroked Xiao Qi’s hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am aware of the limits to my strength, so I stayed here as you told so I wouldn’t get in your way...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Awww, good girl~ I’m fine! Let’s not forget that we have two powerful masters next door!” Gu Qingyu laughed again. “It’s late, try to get some sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmhm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu slept especially well this night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Early morning.</b></p>
 <p><span style>“Boom, boom, boom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The persistent loud knocking woke Gu Qingyu up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu was not a morning person. Suffering from bad morning temper, she felt really irritated and cranky when she was woken up by the sudden noise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Gu Qingyu was angry, there would be severe consequences!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She put on some clothes sluggishly, then walked to the door with her might bird’s nest of hair. “WHO IS IT!?” yelled Gu Qingyu as she kicked open the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And there he stood... Qi Yichen!!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stood there frozen by her appearance. His hand was dangling awkwardly in the air, as though he was going to greet her. His face seemed to say that he had seen something he was not supposed to see.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Gu Qingyu did not think twice before she slammed the door shut.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Noooooooooo————</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She fell to her knees and hid her face in her hands. “My image is ruined!! Aaaarghhh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xiao Qi finished dressing up and brushing her own hair, she walked to Gu Qingyu and asked, “Who was it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was Qi Yichen!” Gu Qingyu looked totally drained. “Can you help me fix my hair, Xiao Qi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course!” Xiao Qi enthusiastically picked up the comb from the table. “Rest assured, Xiao Yu! I’ll make your hair super pretty and dazzling! So shiny you can go make them blind!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>... Who is this savage person? What happened to my Xiao Qi? Return my innocent Xiao Qi!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu felt her brain overloading.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After getting dolled up, Gu Qingyu slowly opened the door again but saw another person standing outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Morning, Jia Qizhe,” she greeted him awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe nodded and said, “Qi Yichen went down earlier to order breakfast for us. He should be waiting, let’s go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Yes.” Gu Qingyu was compelled to face Qi Yichen, so she hid behind Xiao Qi, walking the half the speed of a snail’s pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen had a big grin on his face when he saw them arriving. He spoke to Gu Qingyu in the most natural manner, “It’s going to get cold, let’s dig in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since he’s acting as if nothing happened, I’ll do the same.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly there was a clatter of horse hooves outside the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Faster! We received a report saying that Third Miss is at this inn!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let her get away!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Loud voices could be heard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu felt uneasy when she heard the voices. She swiftly grabbed an armful of steamed buns and shooed everyone back upstairs to hide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The speed!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The vigour!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu shut the door with a loud slam. “How did they find this place?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe just stared at the steamed buns in her embrace and asked instead, “Are you very hungry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, I am! I didn’t even get to take a single bite!” She proceeded to stuff the food in her mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long, they heard the thudding of guards’ footsteps downstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should we do?” Gu Qingyu sat on the floor eating as she stamped her feet in frustration. Xiao Qi had a whole new level of respect for Qingyu after seeing her gestures and took notes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe looked at her as if she’d said something odd. “You think I’m afraid?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, but I don’t think it’s a good idea to slaughter our way out! Plus, Gu Family shouldn’t be taken lightly...” she said hesitantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were no feelings when she said the words ‘Gu Family’, as though she was just casually mentioning another household. In fact, such was the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right.” Jia Qizhe seemed to be in deep contemplation after hearing her sense of logic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>None of them seemed too bothered with the issues looming ahead. The atmosphere around them was rather calm and quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Qi Yichen let out a helpless sigh and said, “Let me try to delay them. Jia Qizhe, see if it’s possible to escape through the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Gu Qingyu looked confused at first, then her eyes shone as if she finally understood.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>The guards haven’t met Qi Yichen before!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She exclaimed excitedly, “Then let us meet up at that small stream we passed by yesterday in the bamboo forest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen gave her a nod of assent, then opened the door and went out. He ‘casually’ swung the door close, as to not draw any unnecessary attention to the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe quietly opened the window. He turned his head to Gu Qingyu, “You two first. I’ll be right behind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok!” Gu Qingyu nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu gestured at Xiao Qi, “Faster! I’ll lead, you stay in the middle and Jia Qizhe will bring up the rear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi nodded and didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It should be fine for me to use my Spirit Form since Jia Qizhe saw me using it back in the bat demon’s den. And Xiao Qi knows already.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The fluffy ears popped once more out of the sides of her head and a long tail slowly crept from underneath her body, wagging from side to side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She carefully peeked out the window to see if the coast was clear. When she thought it was clear, she gave them a nod and climbed out, jumping down first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi followed closely after, and Jia Qizhe last.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Inside the inn.</b></p>
 <p><span style>The guards rushed up as Qi Yichen just reached the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ransack this place!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let Third Miss escape!”</span></p>

 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>“Argh! I can’t do this anymore!!” Gu Qingyu fell like a leaf, collapsing flat on the ground. “Just leave me here!... Uhhh, if only you have the heart to leave me here!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Gu Qingyu tried to push her luck and stayed on the ground like a dead pig. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>“...” Jia Qizhe stopped and looked at her, then continued walking. “Move.”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Qi Yichen threw a glance in Gu Qingyu’s direction but followed behind Jia Qizhe.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Gu Qingyu peeped with one eye to see if they stayed. “I can’t believe it! You guys really have the heart to abandon me!” She shouted at Xiao Qi, “Xiao Qi! Wait!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Xiao Qi sprang back to Gu Qingyu’s side and helped her up, “Xiao Yu, it’s getting really dark. There are monsters everywhere at night, so get up and let’s go!”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Even pleading to Xiao Qi didn’t work anymore. So Gu Qingyu steeled herself and ran up to Jia Qizhe. She threw herself down and wrapped her arms around his legs like a monkey, “Aaaaah! Distinguished, admirable, handsome, elegant and magnanimous Hero Jia! Just a short break~ Pleaseeeeee~!”[/expand]</span></p>
