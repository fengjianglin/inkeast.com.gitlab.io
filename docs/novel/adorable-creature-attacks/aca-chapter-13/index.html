 <p><strong>Chapter 13: Hundred Whirling Leaf</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>More and more black-clothed men jumped out of the woods before Gu Qingyu’s eyes. She turned and looked at the others, who were busily fighting. Jia Qizhe seemed to be starting to have a hard time trying to continuously repel the never-ending attacks while Xiao Qi was also surrounded by enemies.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is there nothing I can do?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu turned her gaze back to Qi Yichen. There was still some faint green light shimmering around the remainings of the Thousand Blossoming Grass. Gu Qingyu bit her lips as she took out the Hundred Whirling Leaf from her pouch. She put the leaf to her lips and blew softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if the two of them had barely got acquainted, Mo Bai was the only one she could depend on right now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a soft and gentle melody rang out, white light condensed before her, and took form in the shape of a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The masses of light gradually dispersed. A young man walked out of the light, his black hair draped down over his dark-cyan robe and a faint white aura shimmered around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai was first slightly stunned by the perilous situation around Gu Qingyu, then smiled gently at her as he greeted. “Long time no see, Miss Gu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s great that you’re here, Mo Bai! I knew you would come!” Gu Qingyu got up from the ground and jumped to his side. “We were ambushed by them on our way up.” She pointed at the black-clothed men. “What should we do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai looked up at the assassins surrounding them. He lightly swung his sleeve and a cluster of leaves flew out. The leaves hovered gently in the air, almost peacefully, and then they all began to whirl. Suddenly, one leaf flew forwards, another followed, and then they flew in all directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu looked at the flying leaves, bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The leaves increased in numbers and speed. Multiplying by the second. The leaf storm sliced through the air, and wherever it passed, black-clothed men collapsed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Thank goodness I kept this one in my pocket!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after the leaf storm lifted, most of the enemies were either dead or heavily injured.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavens, Mo Bai! You’re so powerful!” Gu Qingyu felt all kinds of respect for him. “I’ll just stick with you in the future~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sure Miss Gu is exaggerating, but I’m humbled by your praise.” Mo Bai cupped his fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe groaned indistinctly in pain, but the sound couldn’t escape from Gu Qingyu’s ears. She quickly turned around to him. “Did you get hurt, Jia Qizhe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” The corner of his mouth twitched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oho, where did you get hurt? A strong person like you can get hurt?” She immediately ran over to him to look at his wound, then turned her head to Mo Bai. “Mo Bai, do you have any more of those herbs for wounds?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I do——” Green light emitted from his palm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch. I don’t need his herbs.” Jia Qizhe interrupted Mo Bai. He held out his hand in front of Gu Qingyu, “Look.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a deep cut on his right hand, blood oozed from the open wound as though each blood drop raced against each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh no! You’re losing too much blood! Mo——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I already said that I don’t need his herbs!” He furrowed his brows and raised his left hand over the cut, “『Cure』!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blue light emitted from his left hand and shone over the cut, healing the wound in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh?” Gu Qingyu was startled by the sight. “What——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not the only one who can cast recovery magic,” said Jia Qizhe arrogantly and proudly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu found Jia Qizhe, for some odd reason, very adorable when he was acting like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Th-then why didn’t you do it earlier?” Gu Qingyu was flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s none of your business.” Jia Qizhe slipped his sword gracefully back into its sheath. “On your feet everyone, let’s get moving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen and Xiao Qi closed in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu looked at Mo Bai, “I’m so sorry, Mo Bai. I didn’t know what else to do than to call upon you... Will you come with us or are you going to return now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The usual imposing manners of hers vanished without a trace, and the loud voice of hers changed to subdued tones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I suppose I could join you, Miss Gu. I won’t be idle, and you’ll have one more companion on the road.” Mo Bai smiled gently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm-hmm!” Gu Qingyu nodded excitedly. “Sounds great!” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Another strong individual joined us, all right. No more worrying about assassins with experts defending all sides!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe sneered and went ahead first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu gave him a strange look, then followed behind him while catching up with Mo Bai. Xiao Qi kept on at the same pace and Qi Yichen brought up the rear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe’s sword was emanating a fiery blue aura. He would slash down monsters on the road, many a time. An extremely disturbing sight and definitely not a pretty mood, or so Gu Qingyu thought.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai showed indifference. Qi Yichen looked like he thought there was nothing strange about it. And Xiao Qi, she was too occupied worrying about Gu Qingyu, who was sucking in air through her clattering teeth without stopping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Gu Qingyu thought, the worse she felt, until she finally couldn’t keep it in anymore. She asked cautiously, “Are... you in a bad mood, Jia Qizhe?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch.” Jia Qizhe sneered coldly. He slashed mercilessly down another monster to answer her question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Most people will have bad days now and then. Do you... like to slay monsters when you’re having a bad day?” Gu Qingyu asked again in the same cautious tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tch.” Jia Qizhe sneered coldly again, then slashed down yet another monster as his answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think it’s great that you have this approach to things when you’re experiencing a bad day...” Gu Qingyu sucked cold air through her teeth. “Please, have at it...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Gu Qingyu didn’t dare say anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai suddenly opened his mouth and asked her, “About this sir Jia, how exactly did you get acquainted with him?” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He did not just ask me that at the worst of times!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm... He’s my friend and... we’re on this trip together so...” Gu Qingyu tried her best to explain.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>... Why does it sound so ridiculous and bizarre when I say it?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh.” Mo Bai cast a sidelong look at Jia Qizhe. He looked like he wanted to say something else, but stopped himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingyu. When we meet my mentor in a bit, please excuse him if he says or does anything that offends you,” said Qi Yichen suddenly. “My mentor has the mischievous nature of a child, and very much likes to play innocent jokes on people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mischievous like a child? Prankster? Now, that really peaks my curiosity, I wonder what illness he’s struck with!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu chuckled softly. “Rest assured! I may not be able to fully cure him but——” Gu Qingyu gradually fell silent and turned to look at the young man dressed in the dark-cyan robe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Cure? Was I just discussing with Qi Yichen about how to treat his mentor? When we have a full-blown experienced physician in front of us? How foolish of me!!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Right. About that...” Gu Qingyu spoke weakly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah?” Qi Yichen looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I believe your mentor can be saved now.” She pointed her chin at Mo Bai. “Look, a Divine Physician in flesh and blood!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai just stood there, speechless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I forgot to mention that my mentor is stricken with mental illness, Qingyu,” Qi Yichen added.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So I was right from the start! Mental illness! He's mentally ill!!&nbsp;</span></i></p>
