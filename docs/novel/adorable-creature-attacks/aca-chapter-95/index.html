 <p>"Okay, it's getting late, and I should go to bed too." Gu Qingyu rolled over, "Master, you should rest early." <em>I don't know if it's because of Yan Ruhuo, when I saw Yan Zun, I felt an inexplicable sense of guilt whenever I see Yan Zun now.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Yan Zun noticed her unease.</p>
 <p>"It's okay, I'm just sleepy." Gu Qingyu brushed it off and closed her eyes. Although Yan Zun was puzzled, he dropped the subject after he saw just how sleepy Gu Qingyu was.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, Gu Qingyu fell asleep. Yan Zun pressed Gu Qingyu's sleeping points, then stood up with a smile. "Why, would you like me to throw you out myself?"</p>
 <p>A figure came out of the shadows, and he had a faint smirk as well. "Yan Zun."</p>
 <p>"Ye Jin." Yan Zun greeted him. The two devilishly charming gentlemen watched at each other. If Gu Qingyu was awake, no one would be surprised at her bleeding nose. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You should have noticed me for a long time?" Yan Zun raised an eyebrow.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin nodded: "Yes. Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny, how can you not pay attention?"</p>
 <p>"So, did you follow her for the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny as well?" Yan Zun grinned.</p>
 <p>"At first, but now, it's not anymore." Ye Jin smiled calmly.</p>
 <p>Yan Zun nodded "So, in the beginning you were after the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny and now you are after me?"</p>
 <p>"Yes." Ye Jin did not deny his deduction. "Yen Zun, you know, your existence is too dangerous. You let Xiao Yu'er enter a life that was not meant for her and put her through danger time and time again."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"So, are you going to destroy me?" Yan Zun smiled playfully, he looked at Ye Jin as though he was a child playing house.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I'm not certain of my true strength." Ye Jin shrugged. "Maybe I could try."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Very good." Yan Zun raised his head and narrowed his eyes slightly. He left the bed and walked across the room, his long red robes dragged on the floor. "Ye Jin, I have to say, you are strong, but you are only human."</p>
 <p>"Human..." Ye Jin's eyes did not fluctuate, "Perhaps."</p>
 <p>"And I am her master. So if I died, what do you think, wouldn’t she be devastated?" Yan Zun turned back and looked at the sleeping Gu Qingyu. The faint blue flame casted soft shadows on her features, she looked beautiful under the blue light.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin seemed unimpressed. "But, if you were alive instead, wouldn’t it bring her greater calamity?" A devious smirk spread across his lips.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Perhaps." Yan Zun copied Ye Jin's tone and answered vaguely.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, an overwhelming, sinister, dark aura appeared.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It seems that before dealing with me, you still have a big problem that has not been solved." Yan Zun sneered, turned into smoke, and dissipated in the air. Ye Jin tch-ed. His eyes settled on Gu Qingyu’s peaceful face, a small smile graced his features and he walked out. He slowly made his way to the lobby at the ground floor. In the center of the room, above the symbol of black flame, stood a man. Those white robes belonged in a painting.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Why, has the Divine Doctor finally lost his patience?" Ye Jin raised his eyebrows.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai glanced at Ye Jin lightly, his right hand rubbed the jade flute in his hand carefully. "It's not like Hero Jia is famous for his patience either.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin smiled frankly: "At least Xiao Yu'er didn't reject me, did she? Divine Doctor Mo ought to study that more. "</p>
 <p>"I don't need your reminder." Mo Bai raised his head slightly, his pupils were normal. "She will learn the truth, eventually. " There was no one else with them to guess what remained unspoken, both of them knew what the other was talking about.</p>
 <p>"Very well then." Ye Jin shrugged indifferently, still with a smile of evil spirits, he turned around and walked away in large strides. "Don't challenge me, or the consequences would be more than you can bear."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai's hand touched the jade flute tightly, and after a long while, he gradually loosened his hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The next day, when Gu Qingyu woke up, she found Yan Zun floating in the air without any surprise. She stretched out her hand and grabbed the hem of Yan Zun's robes. "Master, stop floating. Don't you feel tired floating all night?"</p>
 <p>"How did you know that your master had been floating for a night?" Yan Zun slowly sat down beside Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook his head: "According to your child-ahem, normal behaviour."</p>
 <p>She adjusted her clothes. "Okay, I'm going to eat."</p>
 <p>Yan Zun narrowed his eyes slightly and slowly disappeared into the air.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu pushed open the door and walked out, Ye Jin was heading in her direction.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Good morning, Xiao Zhezhe!" Gu Qingyu grinned.</p>
 <p>"Good morning, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin also yawned, his eyes narrowed like a lazy cat.</p>
 <p>"Did you sleep well last night?" Gu Qingyu immediately covered her nose, feeling that her nosebleed was about to start again. <em>Will I die because of excessive blood loss? I must be the first person in the world to die because of hemorrhage loss due to excessive viewing of beautiful men!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Jin leaned onto Gu Qingyu. "Yeah, I'm so tired, so much for me to clean up."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately blushed. "Oh, get up, Jia Qizhe! Let's go eat!"</p>
 <p>"Why, Xiaoyu'er is shy?" Ye Jin laughed, straightened himself and took Gu Qingyu's hand. "Let's go."</p>
 <p>"Um..." Gu Qing nodded and gave his hand a comforting grip.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin smiled happily.</p>
 <p>Led by Ye Jin, Gu Qingyu came to a small dining room. There are two bowls of millet porridge and some side dishes on the table.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, you can't eat too much in the morning, you need to eat something nutritious." After seeing Gu Qingyu's frustrated expression, Ye Jin looked at Gu Qingyu seriously, "Good, finish everything and I bring you out for lunch."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu sat down and looked around. There were only enough settings for two. "What about the others?" She asked curiously.</p>
 <p>"Maybe they are still asleep. I have sent someone to bring them breakfast." Ye Jin looked at Gu Qingyu expectantly. "Xiao Yu'er, would you like to try my cooking?"</p>
 <p>"You made all this?" Gu Qingyu couldn't help but pick up the spoon in surprise, scoop a spoonful of porridge, and put it in her mouth. The light taste spread across her tongue. Ye Jin picked up the chopsticks, picked up a slice of meat and held it near her mouth. She opened her mouth and took a bite. The thin slice of meat was supple, the thin layer of fat melted against her tongue and deepened the flavour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe, I didn't expect your skills to be so good!" Gu Qingyu exclaimed, "Whoever that marries you, that person is in luck!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You're right." Ye Jin smiled, and supported his head with one hand, watching Gu Qingyu sip her porridge.</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Gu Qingyu raised her head from the bowl. "Why don't you eat?"</p>
 <p>"It's enough to watch you eat." Ye Jin smiled slightly, full of soft warmth.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's face turned red again, and she was at a loss in the face of a romantic Jia Qizhe. "Don't be so mushy, let's eat."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Ye Jin picked up his spoon and began to eat.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Breakfast soon ended, Ye Jin reached out his hand and stroked Gu Qingyu's face.</p>
 <p>"What, what?" Gu Qingyu's face was red again.</p>
 <p>She wasn't disgusted, but she was too shy... Gu Qingyu might be ostentatious and brazen, but she was still a girl after all. As the saying goes, heroes fall before beauty.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin's index finger gently wiped off a grain of rice at Gu Qingyu's mouth, then he placed his finger against his lips, his tongue slipped out from those lips and it slowly licked away the grain of rice… And right then, she shot up from her seat. "Ahahaha Xiao Zhezhe, don't you still have something to do? Hurry up and come back early hahaha..."</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Ye Jin smiled enchantingly. "I can finish it within today. You must wait for me, Xiao Yu'er~"</p>
 <p>"G-good!" Gu Qingyu stuttered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin suddenly bent down, leaned into her and placed a soft kiss on her forehead. "See you soon." His fingertips swept gently over her cheek as he turned and left the room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was rooted in place, obviously shellshocked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After a long time, someone knocked on her door.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Who is it?" Gu Qingyu immediately recovered.</p>
 <p>"Boss! It's me!" Qi Wan's voice came from outside the door. Gu Qingyu opened the door, as expected, and saw Qi Wan's smile.</p>
 <p>"Good morning! Boss!" Qi Wan grinned.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "Good morning. Have you eaten?"</p>
 <p>"The leader of Ye had someone to deliver it! Breakfast was very good!" Qi Wan also nodded. "Boss, are you going to stay here all the time?"</p>
 <p>"That's the question..." Gu Qingyu held her chin with one hand, "Xiao Zhezhe said that he can finish things within today, then we will simply play for another day and resume our journey tomorrow!"</p>
 <p>"Okay!" Qi Wan blinked and blinked. "Boss, you take me to play!"</p>
 <p>"Well, okay." Gu Qingyu walked out of the room and suddenly turned to look at Qi Wan. "Yes, how did things go between you and Xiao Qi yesterday?"</p>
 <p>"What do you mean?" Qi Wan also looked at Gu Qingyu in wonder.</p>
 <p>"Didn't you talk?" Gu Qingyu gestured vaguely. "You know, about..."</p>
 <p>"What?" Qi Wan looked even more puzzled.</p>
 <p>"Oh! Don't pretend that you don't know!" Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Didn't you talk to her? What's the result?"</p>
 <p>"Oh! That's what you're talking about!" Qi Wan's face suddenly realised. "You should have said so sooner!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stared at him blankly.<em>&nbsp;Didn't I already say it?</em></p>
 <p>"Well," Qi Wan seemed to be thinking, and paused. "I told her, we are both still young, there's still a whole life ahead of us. We should focus more on ourselves, study hard and stay on the right path!"</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu almost shrieked. "You really said that?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah," Qi Wan smiled, "Isn't it really good? Really inspiring?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh, you idiot!"</p>
