<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>"Yeah, that's what nature is like." Gu Qingyu smiled. "And that's why we humans love to explore and learn more about nature."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Well, yeah..." Qi Wan sighed as he squinted and watched Gu Qingyu play with the fishes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An afternoon soon passed just like that. Time always flies when you're having fun, and just when you want that moment to freeze and stop forever, it had already passed. In a blink of an eye, it was already evening.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan stretched his back. "Okay, let's go, go back and eat~"</p>
 <p>"Uh-huh." Gu Qingyu reluctantly looked back at the scenery, then turned back and walked out of the forest with Qi Wan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Back in the palace, after dinner, Gu Qingyu asked the question that had been eating her away. "Qi Wan, I always wanted to ask, where is this place? Who are you, exactly?" She paused, then continued before he could respond. "Of course, if you don't want to say it, you don't have to force yourself."</p>
 <p>"If you want to listen to the boss, of course, I can say," Qi Wan raised his eyebrows, "This is called Ling Ding Mountain, I named it. And I am the boss of Ling Ding. It's sort of like an organisation as well."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh, that's what it is." Gu Qingyu nodded her head with a clear look, "Got it, thank you."</p>
 <p>"Well, there is still another place we can check out at night. Are you tired, Boss? Do you want to see it or do you want to sleep?" Qi Wan asked her.</p>
 <p>"Of course, let's go!" Gu Qingyu snapped her fingers and stood up. "Lead the way!"</p>
 <p>"Well, it was the same spot" Qi Wan narrowed his eyes and smiled. "It's just a different scenery at night~"</p>
 <p>"Then let's not waste time!" Gu Qingyu rubbed her hands together excitedly.</p>
 <p>"Oh, we might have to wait a bit more." Qi Wan looked out of the door, and it was still fairly bright. "The surprise would only show up at night."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu pouted. She laid on the table and played the chopsticks, hoping that time would pass quickly.</p>
 <p>Seeing her like this, Qi Wan couldn't bear to let her wait any longer and immediately stood up and smacked the table. "It's okay! It's a little early, but it'll still work! Let's go!"</p>
 <p>"Good! Let's do this!" Gu Qingyu also got up immediately, excited.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan grabbed her hand and walked out to the original springboard. They stood on the springboard, and just like before, Qi Wan slowed down the springboard with his ribbons.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everything was dark at first, but things were different when they arrived at the pastures. It may be night already, but it was not dark at all. Moonlight filtered through the clouds, specks of light floated in the cool air of the end of winter. It was fireflies. One by one, fireflies hovered among the grass with small lanterns, like scattered pearls. Their light glowed from hints of green to yellow, than back to green again. Gu Qingyu took in the scenery around her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Wan watched her quietly as he remained by her side. Under the faint moonlight, his face looked a little misty and soft. "Boss..."</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu turned to look at Qi Wan. She was in a very good mood, it was clear that she loved the surprise.</p>
 <p>Under the shining light of the stars, Qi Wan's face appeared soft. He took a deep breath, nervousness written on his face, and then he said slowly, "Qingyu, I love you."</p>
 <p>"I..." Gu Qingyu was stunned. She did not expect Qi Wan to confess to her so suddenly. She didn't know how to answer him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Seeing her lost and shocked reaction, Qi Wan lowered his gaze to the ground and hid the swirling emotion in his eyes. He smiled and said with a laugh, "It's so hard to find a soulmate in this world. I'm grateful to have a friend like you."</p>
 <p><em>Ah, friend? Soulmate?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu couldn't help but breathe a sigh of relief, and also smiled. "Well, then you should cherish it more."</p>
 <p>"What, haven't I cherished it enough?" Qi Wan asked with blinking eyes. Then he turned to look at the sky, "Yeah, this is enough."</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu didn't understand what he was referring to.</p>
 <p>"Spending time with you, one on one." Qi Wan reminded with a cheeky smile, "What will happen if Hero Jia finds out?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's face instantly turned green. "I think you will die miserably. Of course, I will not be much better."</p>
 <p>"Well, that's good! It'll be worth it to drag you down with me!" Qi Wan nodded thoughtfully.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu slapped his head mercilessly. "Get lost!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan massaged his head. "Ouch, Boss! You're so fierce, who would even dare to want to marry you except for me?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Tch, I can take care of myself just fine, I don't need nobody." Gu Qingyu answered Qi Wan with disdain.</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Qi Wan's expression suddenly realized. "You're a strong, independent woman!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Then tomorrow morning, I'll cook breakfast. Would porridge be good?" Gu Qingyu asked with her hand on her chin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Ahahaha, I don't want to trouble you, boss. You're a guest, there is no way I would let you do this!" Qi Wan gave her a sincere smile. "You should just shower and enjoy a good night's sleep, then wake up to a feast. Leave someone else to do it!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "Well said!"</p>
 <p>The night grew darker. Qi Wan just wanted to say something, but he heard Gu Qingyu ask, "Qi Wan, do you know about the Frost Lotus?"</p>
 <p>"Of course. I grew up on an extremely steep iceberg. Boss, what kind of thing do you ask?" Qi Wan looked at Gu Qingyu curiously. "I heard that Ye has been sending people to look for it, and they have lost many people over the years trying to find that thing. The Frost Lotus can cure all kinds of diseases and all the poisons in the world. In fact, there are some illnesses and poisons that can only be cured by it. It's definitely a good thing, but to get it at the cost of so many human lives? It's really suspicious."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan just told Gu Qingyu all of his speculations and thoughts. He really was not guarded towards her.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was also very moved and nodded. "I want to find it, I have to."</p>
 <p>"Is there something wrong with you?" Qi Wan immediately looked at Gu Qingyu, his eyes concerned.</p>
 <p>"Ah, no." Gu Qingyu shook her head, and she didn't intend to hide from Qi Wan. "It's Ye Jin."</p>
 <p>"No wonder... I guessed it before, otherwise, Ye wouldn't have poured so much into finding it." Qi Wan nodded and snapped his fingers, "Okay, I'll take care of this!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu copied what she used to see on television and clasped her hand together. "I thank you for this great kindness, and I will surely repay you in my next life!”</p>
 <p>"It doesn't have to be your next life, &nbsp;you can just marry me in this life." Qi Wan smiled gracefully.</p>
 <p>"Come on," Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Stop kidding, I'm sleepy. Let's go back together."</p>
 <p>"Mm." Qi Wan still narrowed his eyes and smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Oh yeah, what about my weapons?" Gu Qingyu frowned, suddenly thinking of the matter, "Can I call them back to me?"</p>
 <p>"If you want to, of course you can call it back. Your will just needs to be strong enough." Qi Wan nodded. "You can try it, but you can't summon it with usual means."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu wondered. "Why?"</p>
 <p>"That's the basic method, just a simple summoning and appearance. So if you want it to come to your side, then you have to add in more willpower and intent. Then you call out to it with your heart." Qi Wan nodded. .</p>
 <p>"Okay, I see." Gu Qingyu said thoughtfully, "Let's go."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>Back at the palace</strong></p>
 <p>She was led by Qi Wan to the door of a room. Qi Wan opened the door and bowed. "Boss, please!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu raised her feet and walked in. As soon as she entered the room, she was shocked by the magnificent decoration. She opened her mouth, her face in disbelief. "Qi Wan, do you have to be this extravagant?"</p>
 <p>"Haha, do you like it?" Qi Wan smiled. "Hurry up and sleep. Call me if there's anything, I'll be next door."</p>
 <p>"Well, okay." Gu Qingyu sat on the mattress, and immediately felt trapped, the bed was soft.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan turned back three times in a step, and his eyes were all “soft and tender”.</p>
 <p>Finally, Gu Qingyu couldn't help but ask, "Is there anything else?"</p>
 <p>"Boss, I'm so handsome, don't you want to keep me with you?" Qi Wan flicked his hair as he leaned against the table.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu grabbed a cup and threw it at him. "Come on, don't hide, I'll help you get a face lift."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan caught the teacup deftly. "No! Don’t! We can talk this out! Don't ruin my handsome face!"</p>
 <p>"Because you are so handsome, so handsome that you’re causing so much trouble, so I plan to ruin it and help you regain your humanity! Thank you very much!" Gu Qingyu said with a straight face.</p>
 <p>"Oh, I don't know why this baby was so sleepy..." Qi Wan immediately shouted and put the teacup on the table.</p>
 <p>"Well, do you want to stay, handsome?" Gu Qingyu's hand played with the teapot.</p>
 <p>"No, no! You must rest quickly!" Qi Wan immediately flew out and closed the door.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu laughed as she laid down on the bed. She had a fun day.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Tomorrow, I can go to find Ye Jin. I can barely wait...</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu somehow felt odd, but she couldn't think of what she overlooked. Suddenly, she suddenly looked up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny! I promised the Master that I would take back the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny but the situation did not go as planned and she did not manage to retrieve it. Oh, I'm really gonna have a headache tomorrow.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu scratched her head and laid down again, staring at the ceiling in a daze.</p>
 <p><em>The last time we met, it was in that strange liminal space. Maybe I can visit him in that space again? He did say that I can go there as long as I can sense him, shall I try?</em></p>
 <p>She closed her eyes and tried to enter the spirit world.</p>
 <p>The spirit world was gloomy and dark, the red in the sky and the earth had vanished, replaced by a sickly grey. Gu Qingyu clenched her fists and pulled off the Devouring Lotus hanging from her neck. The Devouring Lotus let out a bright light and lit up her surroundings. It was the only light source in that world.&nbsp;</p>
