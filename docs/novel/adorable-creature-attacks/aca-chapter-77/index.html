<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>A bamboo cottage in a quaint bamboo forest, with clear streams and moonlight. Tucked away in the bamboo forest, it was truly a hidden paradise. No, it was even more beautiful and enchanting than a hidden paradise, it should be a Xanadu. Gu Qingyu sighed sweetly. "It's so beautiful!"</p>
 <p>"So, do you regret it?" Xie Zang smiled slightly.</p>
 <p>The bamboo forest around the cottage was dense, and there was a small clearing beside the bamboo cottage. The giant, bright moon hung above the small estate. The stream ran in the backyard. <em>Ding, ding, dong, dong.&nbsp;</em>That sounded like a bamboo water wheel behind the building. Gu Qingyu shook her head immediately. "No regrets, not one bit!"</p>
 <p>"I just wanted to treat you to dinner first, Kitten. Demon wolf meat is exquisite, barbecued or steamed." Xie Zang sighed, "But Kitten, you clearly did not want to stay there for even a moment, so I had to bring you here directly."</p>
 <p><em>I regret it now! Can I please take back my words? Of course not, that's impossible.&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu had an urge to stab herself. "I was wrong."</p>
 <p>"Well, as long as you can change over to a new leaf." Xie Zang stroked the top of her head. Right then, she caught a whiff of something in the air. It is the smell of barbecued meat.</p>
 <p>Her eyes lit up. "There's food?"</p>
 <p>Xie Zang chuckled, the sound was deep, she could hear it rumble in his chest. "You're really a kitten." He patted her head, indicating that she could go in.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately ran into the cottage. As soon as she opened the door, a scrumptious spread unveiled before her. The smell and the sight made her salivate. "Oh my god!"</p>
 <p>"Oh!" Qi Wan, who followed her in, stared at all this with a daze.</p>
 <p>"My!" Qi Yichen's fan almost fell to the ground when he entered after Qi Wan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"God." Xie Zang finished their sentence with a smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately rushed to the table with Qi Wan and both of them tore into the spread.</p>
 <p>Initially, Qi Yichen still tried to maintain the image of "the graceful scholar". But his resolve faltered as he watched Gu Qingyu and Qi Wan. Finally, he threw away his fan in a perfect arch and joined in the fray. Jia Qizhe watched them as he slowly crossed his arms across his chest. "The starving ghost is reborn." Mo Bai simply smiled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You can join them if you want to, pretty face." Jia Qizhe smirked as he whispered to him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai laughed, he gently rubbed the jade flute in his hand, and whispered back, "I believe you're the one that wishes to join them, bitch."</p>
 <p>"Ah? You wanna fight?" Jia Qizhe looked at Mo Bai with contempt. Mo Bai merely smiled and walked outside. Jia Qizhe hmphed as he followed him out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu ate as she watched the two men, one in blue and one in white, disappear into the forest. "What are they up to?"</p>
 <p>"Don't ask questions you're not prepared to know the answers to." Qi Wan replied in between bites.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and returned to her plate. Finally, Xiao Qi caved and joined them at the table. All that was left was a smiling Xie Zang and a paralysed Murong Zuoyu, both of them stood at the side and watched them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, almost all the plates and bowls have emptied out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I didn't think you two would be such big eaters." Gu Qingyu rubbed her belly and commented.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Who are you talking about..." Qi Yichen rolled his eyes and stretched out his hand. The fan flew back into his hand. Qi Yichen opened it with a flick, sank into a nearby chair and fanned himself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu pouted, drank the last bowl of soup in one breath, and sank into the chair beside him. "Nice!"</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen was dumbfounded. Murong Zuoyu was dumbfounded. On the other hand, Qi Wan and Xie Zang smiled rather calmly and glanced knowingly at each other. Xiao Qi looked at Gu Qingyu and Qi Yichen with admiration.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The bamboo cottage may look small on the outside, but it was quite spacious inside, there were even enough rooms for each of them. Gu Qingyu nodded gratefully at Xie Zang. "Thank you, Lord of Xieli Castle."</p>
 <p>"You don't have to be so polite, Kitten." Xie Zang gave her a faint smile. "Go to sleep, there's more fun for you tomorrow~"</p>
 <p>That statement piqued her interest. "Where are we going next?" Xie Zang did not answer. Instead, he placed his index finger in front of his mouth as the corners of his lips curled upwards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, I don't want to know!" Gu Qingyu nodded vigorously, turned around, and walked back to her room. <em>Where's Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai? I should just prepare two bottles of medicinal oil first.</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu closed the door as she entered her room. Then, she walked across the room and opened the window. The silver moonlight poured down from the sky and shined on the stream. The ripples along the stream caught the light and the stream was adorned with silvery-white scales.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It's so beautiful!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was about to exclaim, but someone by the window had stolen her line. She jumped at the voice, there was no one else inside. She leaned out the window and checked. "Qi Wan?"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was outside, he leaned against the wall right next to her window. His green robe swayed in the moonlight. Somehow, even though she had long gotten used to his presence, the moonlight and the soft shadows changed his features. The sight of him stole her breath away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>There was only a window between them. One was in the house, alone; the other was outside, alone. His face had a devilish charm against the silvery moon, and as he turned, the light gleamed brightly in his green pupils. Like a lake on a warm spring day, accompanied by the fragrance of flowers, but also by the ripples from a sunshower. There was silence for a long time.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Finally, Gu Qingyu broke the spell. She turned away and asked, "What's up, Qi Wan?"</p>
 <p>He laughed a little. "No, it's nothing. I just came out for a walk and I saw you opened the window."</p>
 <p>She stared at the moon and murmured, "Maybe, only this moonlight will remain unchanged for thousands of years..."</p>
 <p>"Yeah." He heard her. Maybe it's because of their shared experience in transmigration, she always felt particularly close to Qi Wan, he was the only one that truly understood how she felt.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu held the windowsill with one hand and jumped up. Then she lowered herself and perched on the windowsill. When she had settled into her seat, Qi Wan slowly said, "Gu Qingyu, you don't really recognize me?"</p>
 <p>"Eh?" His question caught her off guard. "You are ..."</p>
 <p>"Well, you have so many patients, how can you remember which one I was." Qi Wan smiled self-deprecatingly.</p>
 <p>That revelation surprised her. "You were one of my patients?"</p>
 <p>He nodded. "Yeah, sort of."</p>
 <p>"Then why don't I remember you...?" She immediately began to sieve through her memory.</p>
 <p>"My appearance and my name have completely changed after I transmigrated. It's normal for you to not recognise me." Qi Wan shrugged nonchalantly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She looked at him curiously. "What is your real name?"</p>
 <p>He returned her curious gaze with a mysterious smile. "I'm not telling."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes at his response. "Fine, keep it to yourself. It's not like I wanted to know or anything..." A knowing grin then split across her face. "So you have a psychological disorder, Qi Wan. I couldn't tell at all. Why? Were you worried that the moment you told me, I would give you a second diagnosis?" She dragged out her last sentence, pausing after each syllable.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan jumped up immediately and spat. "Rubbish, you're the one that has a disorder! I'm perfectly healthy, don't lump me with you!"</p>
 <p>"You're perfectly healthy? I'm a psychiatrist. Why were you one of my patients if you did not have any mental health issues? What, did you see me for gynecology?" Gu Qingyu eyed him suspiciously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan spat again. "Nonsense! Also, can you even treat gynecological diseases?"</p>
 <p>"I can try. I did go to Med school." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "I didn't expect you to be like this, Qi Wan."</p>
 <p>"I didn't expect you to be like this either, Boss." Qi Wan suddenly cursed. "Oh shit!"</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Gu Qingyu turned around and looked at him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai are back from their fight! They must never see me with you, otherwise, I'm dead!" Qi Wan whined, "Why does this look like you're cheating with me, or that I'm stealing you away?"</p>
 <p>"There's no cheating or stealing going on." Gu Qingyu shooed him away. "Get going, I don't have any more medicinal oil. " Qi Wan was speechless.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu vaulted back into her room and opened the door.</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe was walking in from outside the house, and Mo Bai was behind him. This time, there were no bruises on their faces. She walked over with a little curiosity, but before she got too close, she heard Mo Bai mutter as he lightly glanced at Jia Qizhe. "You're good, bitch."</p>
 <p>"You're not a slouch yourself, pretty face." Jia Qizhe scoffed. "Although, your men are horrible at group fights."</p>
 <p><em>Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai! I didn't expect you two to be like this!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>But she quickly caught the keyword. <em>Group fights? I already knew that they weren't ordinary people, but they didn't seriously drag out each others' lackeys for a group fight, right? That being said, who won? Judging from their conversation, it was Jia Qizhe?</em></p>
 <p>"Your men are not very good either." Mo Bai turned around, he was about to head back to his room, but his eyes met with Gu Qingyu's curious gaze.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu waved awkwardly. "Erm... I just arrived... I didn't hear anything..."</p>
 <p><em>Doesn't this sound like I actually heard something?</em></p>
 <p>"Ah, no, actually I was here from the start..."</p>
 <p><em>The start of what? This is not helping either!</em></p>
 <p>"I……"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's hand continued to gesticulate in the air, Mo Bai showed her a gentle smile. "Yu'er, it's so late, why are you still up?"</p>
 <p>"Well..." Gu Qingyu swallowed thickly and looked at Jia Qizhe. "I actually..." <em>What? Waiting to see which one of you won?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>An idea popped into her head. "Oh, I was about to sleep, but neither of you were back, and it's so late. So I came out to check, ahahaha..."</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, were you worried about me?" A smile spread across Jia Qizhe's face. "Go to sleep, staying up late is bad for your health." He took Gu Qingyu's hand and escorted her to her room. He even closed the door behind her. &nbsp;After he came out, he saw Mo Bai's gloomy eyes and smiled, "Why, haven't you had enough?"</p>
 <p>The jade flute on Mo Bai's hand suddenly flew towards Jia Qizhe, Jia Qizhe dodged. But Mo Bai had thrown the jade flute with so much momentum that it kept flying, and it broke through Gu Qingyu's door. She was about to take off her clothes and go to bed. The jade flute had flown right across her face and gave her a fright. In order to not to let it damage Xie Zang's cottage any further, she held out her hand and grabbed it. The jade flute stopped after leaving a red, bloody mark on her palm.&nbsp;</p>
