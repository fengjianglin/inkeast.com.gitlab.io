 <p><strong>Chapter 17: Are you more handsome than me?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Oooh, Jia Qizhe! I never expected you to come up with something like this!” She gestured to Xiao Qi to bring out a mirror from her bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stood still and looked at herself in the bronze mirror she’d bought for a bargain previously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her black hair had been bound up. Her face was perfectly clear, sharp and defined, and her eyes were bright. Wearing the light purple robe, she looked full of vigour, a full-blown man. A handsome young man. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I didn’t think I could look so good!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu caressed her own face lovingly. “So handsome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfft.” Qi Yichen burst out laughing. “I’ve encountered plenty of self-loving individuals, but you are the first to be more narcissistic and self-loving than my mentor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, thanks for the compliment~” Gu Qingyu looked happy and pleased as she put away the mirror, then continued to pat her cheeks in a matchless fashion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Jia Qizhe tapped her on the head, “Are you very handsome?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh-huh!” Gu Qingyu nodded without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He tapped on her head again, “More handsome than me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh-huh... Hmm... Eh?” She nodded again but felt something wrong. When she looked up at him and saw the gloomy frown on his face, she immediately shook her head, “Of course not!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So what are these two doing?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen looked at them like they were idiots. “Are you two comparing whose more handsome?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Any opinions?” Jia Qizhe cast him a sidelong glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen chuckled as he casually flicked back his long side-fringe with his fan, “Hehe~ Me, of course!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pffft——!” It was Gu Qingyu’s turn to burst out laughing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Mo Bai gave a pleasant little laugh while walking beside Xiao Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re the most handsome?” Jia Qizhe asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen nodded with undeniable self-love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe smiled eerily, “I think you’ll look even more handsome if you lost an arm. Do you want to die?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen shook his head promptly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu felt speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh my goodness! Must everyone be so self-centred, narcissistic and have sharp, malignant tongues in this party? Well, except for Mo Bai and Xiao Qi...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the journey, the time seemed to pass very fast as chatter and laughter flowed easily between the five of them. Soon they arrived at the gates of the capital, the Imperial City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can we take a walk around the city first? Like sightseeing and shopping?” Gu Qingyu looked at Jia Qizhe pleadingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Amongst the members, Jia Qizhe was practically the commander and ruled the decision making.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Jia Qizhe glanced at her first, then looked up and down the bustling street. Finally, he nodded slowly, “Sure...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yaahooo~!” Gu Qingyu was over the moon about his approval for once. She was so excited that she jumped up and down, completely uncaring about how foolish she must have looked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The five of them walked through the main street, lined with stalls and shops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four handsome men and a pretty woman came walking together down the street.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were so conspicuous that the commoners almost stopped and saluted them at the same time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu’s male disguise made her quite the handsome fella, almost on par with the other young men in the party.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu looked around from stall to stall when she finally found something that caught her eye. She dragged the others with her over to a colourful stall for a look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, boss~ I want this one! And, um, this one!” She held up a sapphire-blue hairpin on her left hand and a pair of amethyst-purple earrings on her right hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have great taste, young master!” The vendor smiled brightly. “But... are you buying these for yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Certainly!” She didn’t seem the least bit suspicious of the odd question the vendor asked her. “Who else could I give them to if not to myself?” She looked from side to side. “Well, one of them is for Xiao Qi... But the other three have no interest in these fancy things.” She fondled the accessories in her hands lovingly. “Aaaaa~ How can I have such good taste~” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do you... Do you have interest in these fancy things?” asked the vendor cautiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Any woman would be interested in these!” answered Gu Qingyu naturally. She had completely forgotten that she wasn’t a woman anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So because any woman would be interested in these, you are also very interested?” asked Jia Qizhe softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Naturally, I...” She paused and sucked her upper lips. She suddenly had the feeling that something was not right and cast a glare at Jia Qizhe, “Naturally, I have </span><b>zero</b><span style> interest!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tossed the accessories back at the stall to prove her ‘disinterest’, then swung her sleeves and left, leaving the vendor merchant stunned, mouth agape and speechless...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai’s eyes suddenly lit up. He seemed to have spotted something of interest and walked ahead alone. Gu Qingyu followed him out of curiosity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He crossed the street, walked down, and stopped in front of a building. Gu Qingyu looked up at the sign.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hundred Herb Hall.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ah, I knew it! What could possibly attract someone like Mo Bai? A pharmacy, of course!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you never been here before, Mo Bai?” asked Gu Qingyu quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mmm.” He nodded slightly. “I usually get what I need in the wilds, but I never thought that a pharmacy in the Imperial City could have so many rare species of herbs and other medicinal ingredients.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It does.” Gu Qingyu mumbled, “After all, this is the largest pharmacy in the whole capital.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai bought a bundle of herbs, which Gu Qingyu helped pick up for him. Curious about what he bought, she tried to probe what kind of herbs was inside it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, a very familiar figure walked in the pharmacy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman was elegantly dressed in a pink dress. Her long dark hair swayed softly with every step she took. She was so beautiful, but in her eyes was a certain shrewd slyness, far beyond her years.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>————It’s her! She’s the one who tried to kill me before back at Gu Manor!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu subconsciously grabbed a hold of Mo Bai’s sleeve and held it tight in her grasp. Feeling the tug on his sleeve, Mo Bai glanced at Gu Qingyu quickly. Her alarmed expression made him puzzled, so he followed her gaze and fixated his eyes on the young woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai asked quietly, “Do you know her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She is supposedly my elder sister.” Gu Qingyu lowered her voice, “</span><i><span style>She tried to harm me in the past, but luckily I managed to escape before anything bad happened</span></i><span style>.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, the young woman turned and looked towards Gu Qingyu’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes met.&nbsp;</span></p>
