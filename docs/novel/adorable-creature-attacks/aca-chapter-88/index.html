 <p>As they entered the tower, thoughts raced through Gu Qingyu's mind. <em>They were just welcomed into Ye's headquarters, where Jia Qizhe had brought them here. Does that mean Jia Qizhe is the leader of Ye? Then, who is Crow, the old man I met back at the outpost in Xiqian?</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe instructed as they walked in. "Take care of these people, they are guests."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Someone immediately flew out of nowhere, stood in front of Qi Wan and others, and bowed. "All of you, please come with me."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu laid quietly in Jia Qizhe's arms, but she was panicking inside. <em>I didn't expect Jia Qizhe to be the leader of Ye. Sure, I was prepared for the idea that Jia Qizhe is definitely not your average joe, but this! I did not see this coming.</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe rubbed Gu Qingyu's head and walked up the stairs, all the way to the top floor. They did not see another person on the way. However, she clearly sensed they were not alone, many people were watching them from the shadows. Her senses were much more sensitive than usual because of her current form. The scrutiny, almost surveillance from the unknown unsettled her and she arched her back, all of the hair on her back stood up. Sensing the uneasiness of the little white tiger in his arms, Jia Qizhe comforted her and smoothened her fur and spoke, "You can all leave."</p>
 <p>In an instant, Gu Qingyu immediately felt that the stares had vanished and only Jia Qizhe's footsteps echoed in the stairwell. "Don't be afraid, they're all my men." His voice were gentle. His steps before a door, Jia Qizhe reached out and gently pushed the door open and walked in. The door closed automatically behind him.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu raised her head and looked at Jia Qizhe. "Meow?" <em>What are you doing?</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe placed a blanket on the table, and then set the little white tiger on the blanket. Then, took out a ball of yarn from nowhere, and placed it near the little white tiger's paw. "Here, do you like it?" Finally, he sat down near the table.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was dumbfounded: "... Meow?" <em>Yeah right! But looking at the ball of blue yarn, it does seem quite enticing...</em></p>
 <p>In the end, under Jia Qizhe's watchful gaze, Gu Qingyu rested her paws on the ball of yarn and gave it a small push.</p>
 <p><em>Eh? It's really fun!&nbsp;</em>She curiously used both of her paws, pushed and pulled the ball of yarn. The yarn unraveled as she played and rolled all over the blanket.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe burst out laughing as he watched her. "I'm glad you like it, Xiao Yu'er." He rubbed Gu Qingyu's head and got up. "Xiao Yu'er, you'll have to play on your own for a while. I'll be back soon."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu barely minded his absence, she was immersed in the world of yarn balls. "Meow." <em>Bye, see you.</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe smiled, went out and closed the door. Gu Qingyu continued to roll the ball of yarn...</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>Snap!</em></p>
 <p>The door was opened again, but Gu Qingyu did not notice who it was. She was too occupied with the ball of yarn. "Meow?" <em>Jia Qizhe, are you here again? Come and help me!</em></p>
 <p>The visitor only saw a cat on the table. Its whole body was wrapped in blue wool. The cat laid on the blanket on the table, and it seemed to be entangled in wool. And yet, it seemed to be absolute bliss. The visitor laughed at the sight. "Boss, to think you will be like this one day!"</p>
 <p>"Meow?" <em>Qi Wan?</em> Gu Qingyu stopped at his voice, raised her head, and just as expected, a dark green robe greeted her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan walked over, clearly holding in his laughter. "Wow, I never thought you would have so much fun with just a ball of yarn..."</p>
 <p>"Meow!" <em>You're not a cat, how would you understand this?</em></p>
 <p>"So do you want me to untie you?" Qi Wan watched her.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Meow!" <em>Of course, hurry up!</em></p>
 <p>Qi Wan held in his laughter and slowly unraveled the yarn. "I have to say, boss, it's quite impressive that you could do this to yourself."</p>
 <p>"Meow!" <em>Hurry up! Or I'll bite you!</em></p>
 <p>"Okay, okay..." Qi Wan gradually removed the yarn around her, taking care to not hurt her. "Did it hurt?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook her head, moved her body, and stared at the Spirit Gem at the edge of the table. "Meow!" <em>Whether or not I can change back depends on that thing!</em></p>
 <p>"This Spirit Gem can help you turn back?" Qi Wan was surprised and passed the Spirit Gem to her. "Boss, you're saved!"</p>
 <p>"Meow ..." <em>Don't say it as if I was chronically ill or something! But how do you use this thing?</em></p>
 <p>"Try holding it in your mouth?" Qi Wan stuffed the gem into her mouth.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu jumped away immediately, and bit Qi Wan's finger instead. "Meow" <em>You asked for this!</em></p>
 <p>"Ow, ow, ow..." Qi Wan let go immediately and checked his hand. There was already a tiny teeth mark. "Boss, you are so mean..."</p>
 <p>"Meow." <em>Thank you for the compliment.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Suddenly, Gu Qingyu's ears shook. There were footsteps in the corridor. She glanced at Qi Wan. "Meow!" <em>Hide! Jia Qizhe is back!&nbsp;</em>Her paw pointed to the window.</p>
 <p>"Then..." Qi Wan looked at the Spirit Gem in his hand.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu quickly held the Spirit Gem with her mouth, and kept it inside with one paw while pointing and waving at the window. "Meow!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded with confidence and jumped from the window. As soon as he disappeared, Jia Qizhe opened the door. Gu Qingyu's heart suddenly jumped. <em>If I remember correctly, we are on the thirteenth floor? Good luck, Qi Wan.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Jia Qizhe looked so pleased and cheerful that she almost had trouble recognising him. Gu Qingyu couldn't reply because of the Spirit Gem, so she stared at Jia Qizhe with wide eyes instead. This cute look made Jia Qizhe stretch out his hand and rub her head. He looked at the window. "This ..."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was shocked. However, Jia Qizhe continued, "This window is not closed, you're going to catch a cold like this."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu breathed a sigh of relief, but Jia Qizhe kept talking. "Xiaoyu'er, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hide this from you for so long."</p>
 <p><em>Hide? Is it about his true identity?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu blinked and blinked as she watched Jia Qizhe return to his seat at the table.</p>
 <p>"I..." Jia Qizhe stared at the patterns on the blanket and avoided her gaze. "Xiao Yu'er, listen well, my real name is Ye Jin."</p>
 <p><em>Ye Jin? That's a beautiful-sounding name!&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu continued to stare at him, imploring him to continue.</p>
 <p>"Yes, I am Ye Jin, the leader of Ye." Jia Qizhe pursed his lips and lowered his head. "Sorry Xiao Yu'er. I really didn't mean to keep this from you..."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu saw the guilt in his eyes and in an instant, she was feeling the same guilt as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Jia Qizhe... I'm sorry, I've also kept many things from you. If I can, I would tell you. I would personally tell you everything, right now.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu suddenly felt a sense of dizziness, and then she saw the white fur on her paws fade bit by bit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe raised his head and saw Gu Qingyu in her pink dress.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled and slowly spoke. "Jia Qizhe, thank you for telling me this. Now, I also have something to tell you." Ye Jin nodded.</p>
 <p>"There is a world, this world is thousands of years from the world we are in, or it's another world entirely. Either way, in that world, there was no magic or martial arts. That world was governed by science. Is that too confusing?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu tilted her head as she continued her explanation. “Everyone is equal in this world, everyone helps each other, there is no distinction between nobility or peasantry. The buildings there are all high-rise buildings, that is, very tall houses. There are cars...well, a car is this mode of transport that has four wheels and small windows... I, In short, I come from that world."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She paused. "That's the real reason why the third Miss of the Gu family changed."</p>
 <p>"Huh." Ye Jin smiled. "And Qi Wan came from the same world as you?" Gu Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin was silent for a while, he thought to himself.<em>&nbsp;In fact, this is very obvious. I figured it out after your explanation. Qi Wan shares a common language with you, the two of you have inside jokes, and only terms and phrases that the two of you understood. Admittedly, sometimes I get jealous of him.</em></p>
 <p>"Ok, I understand." Ye Jin got up and pressed Gu Qingyu into his arms. "Xiao Yu'er, thank you."</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu smiled. "Jia...Ye Jin, how's Qi Wan and the rest?"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, if you feel uncomfortable, you can continue to call me Jia Qizhe." Ye Jin gently ran his fingers through her hair, "They are all safe and well. I have already arranged for them to be well taken care of. "</p>
 <p>"Ok." Gu Qingyu nodded. "Alright. This time everyone spent a lot of energy, it is time to take a good rest."</p>
 <p>"There are many interesting places in this area, Xiao Yu'er. Can I show you around?" Ye Jin tilted his head and looked at Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned down his offer. "Let's go together after we collect all of the Spirit Gems. "</p>
 <p>"Very well." Ye Jin's lips curled. "Xiao Yu'er, you can anywhere in this place. I have something to deal with, it's estimated to take two or three days, but I'll finish it as soon as possible. By the way, if you miss me, just ask someone here to come and get me."</p>
 <p>"You think too much." Gu Qingyu waved her hand as pink settled on her cheeks. "Go, get going." Ye Jin smiled, ruffled her hair and walked out.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu watched him go down the stairs before approaching the window and opening it.</p>
 <p><em>Where is Qi Wan? There is only an empty river… Oh! There's a river! And here I was wondering why there wasn't any sound.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>She was about to leave and head downstairs to check, but she heard a weak voice. "Boss, I'm here..."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately looked down and found that Qi Wan was hanging onto the window sill!</p>
 <p>"How did you do that?" Gu Qingyu said as she tugged on his clothes and pulled him up.</p>
 <p>"Boss, be more gentle! Ah, you caught my neck... Ugh..."</p>
 <p>After Qi Wan came up, he fell into a daze. Gu Qingyu did not waste any time, a few slaps woke him up. "Hey!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan regained his senses, but he was still confused. "Where is this? Boss, you're so mean, you actually hit my handsome face..."</p>

 <p>More names! Jia Qizhe is actually called Ye Jin and he’s the leader of Ye. Also, a nice heart-to-heart conversation between him and Gu Qingyu. This ship is sailing fast…</p>
 <p>On an unrelated note, I personally headcanon that Jia Qizhe either used to keep a cat, and that’s why he knows how to take care of one, and/or that he knits, which would explain why he has a ball of yarn at the ready. Let me know your thoughts!</p>
