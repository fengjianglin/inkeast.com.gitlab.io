<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Gu Qingyu woke to a dull pain in her head, she reached up and covered her head with a moan. She opened her eyes and stared up at the canopy of an ornate bed. Her whole body felt weak and she could not get up.</p>
 <p>A clear female voice came. "Miss, are you awake?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned her head and saw a woman standing beside her with a basin of water in her hands.</p>
 <p>"Miss, I am here to wipe your face for you. You can call me Xiao Qin." Xiao Qin smiled and placed the basin on the table. She pulled out a small towel, dipped it into the basin, wrung it dry then approached Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu scanned her surroundings. The room was wide, like a palace... No, it is a palace, with an opulent and luxurious layout and exquisite and meticulous decorations.</p>
 <p>"Where is this?" Gu Qingyu shifted slightly, tilted her head, and avoided Xiao Qin's hands.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qin's hands stiffened in the air, but she was not annoyed. She slowly withdrew her hands and returned the towel to the basin. "Is Miss complaining that the water is cold? No worries, I will change it now."</p>
 <p>"I'm asking you where this is." Gu Qingyu felt her voice hoarse.</p>
 <p>"Don't rush, Miss, it will be fine soon." Xiao Qin smiled and walked out with the basin.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu only felt a sense of speechlessness. <em>This is completely a communication barrier, okay! She is obviously trolling her!</em></p>
 <p>When Xiao Qin walked into the palace again, the water basin in her hand was steaming hot.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu gave up. "Beauty, I’m hungry."</p>
 <p>Xiao Qin raised her head, her smile remained the same. "Okay, I will tell someone to serve food now."</p>
 <p>"Beauty, can you let your master come?" Gu Qingyu asked tentatively.</p>
 <p>"Miss, the meal is coming soon, please bear with me." Xiaoqin nodded with a smile and gently wiped Gu Qingyu's face with the warm towel.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's lips twitched in annoyance. <em>It seems that I met a master today! She is even better than me...</em></p>
 <p>"Okay, Miss, please wait for a while" Xiao Qin put away the towel, picked up the basin, bowed, and walked out.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu closed her eyes, feeling very helpless. <em>What is pretending to be cool? This is the real master! I'm so weak!</em></p>
 <p>It didn't take long for the door to be opened.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was too lazy to raise her eyes. "Beauty, is the meal coming?"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>No one replied, only the sound of light footsteps, one after another, until the person reached her bed. As the smell of herbal fragrance wafted closer, Gu Qingyu suddenly opened her eyes and turned around. The person standing near her bed was in a white robe. He held a tray, filled with dishes, a glass of water, and a bowl of porridge, with a gentle smile.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er." He smiled and called her name, the same way he always had. He placed the tray on the table, then sat down gently at the edge of her bed.</p>
 <p>"Mo... Bai?" Gu Qingyu looked into his eyes incredulously.</p>
 <p>He smiled. "Yes, it's me. Yu'er."</p>
 <p>"Why..." She swallowed thickly as her heart pounded madly in her chest. .</p>
 <p><em>Why... is it... Mo Bai...</em></p>
 <p>"What's the reason? There's no reason, Yu'er." Mo Bai's slender fingers gently caressed her face, she froze against his touch.</p>
 <p>She sighed and decided to cut to the chase. "Do you want the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny? Or the Spirit Gems?"</p>
 <p>"I want... you." His hand gently lifted a stray lock of her hair and tucked it behind her ear.</p>
 <p>She suddenly locked her eyes with Mo Bai's, his expression remained determined, and his eyes were still dark black.</p>
 <p>"Mo Bai, don't joke around. "Gu Qingyu grinned bitterly, "If I guess right, you are the Emperor of Nanyou.”</p>
 <p>"Yes." Mo Bai did not deny it and nodded calmly.</p>
 <p>"Got it." Gu Qingyu closed her eyes gently. "You can go now."</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, be good and eat." Mo Bai picked up a bowl of porridge from the tray, scooped a spoonful and brought the spoon to her lips. She didn't move, and didn't even want to open her eyes.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai smiled gently. "I said, I'll cook porridge for you." She remained still.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It was not until this stalemate continued for a long time that Mo Bai pulled his hand back and put the bowl back on the table.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, I thought when I bought you back here, I could get rid of all the people around you. But I didn’t expect so much disruption..." Mo Bai sighed and got up.</p>
 <p>"What do you mean?" Her eyes snapped open and she looked at him.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai held out his hand, and resting on his palm was the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny, bundled up in a strange silk thread.</p>
 <p>"Is there anything in here? I just don't know what it is." Mo Bai held up the jewel and turned it over in his hand. "Since I don't know what it is, then I'll just seal it."</p>
 <p>"Don't you dare!" She hissed.</p>
 <p>"By your reaction, there should be something inside." Mo Bai smiled, turned around, and walked towards the door.</p>
 <p>"Come back!" Gu Qingyu tried to push herself up, but it felt as though she was bound by something. "Mo Bai!"</p>
 <p>"Yu'er," Mo Bai didn't look back. His gentle voice turned cold. "I know you like Ye Jin. I’ve always known."</p>
 <p>"So what?" Gu Qingyu asked with a deep frown.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai tilted his head to look at her, his lips curled in a handsome arc. "I want him to die."</p>
 <p>At that moment, her heart sank into icy waters.</p>
 <p>"Ye Jin is so powerful, so it doesn't matter if you throw him into the sea..." Mo Bai's chuckles were low and deep. "No wings, no magic, it doesn't matter..."</p>
 <p>"Stop, please..." Gu Qingyu closed her eyes in pain.</p>
 <p>His chuckles grew louder. "Yu'er, if you follow me, I'll spare him. How’s that? The Empress of Nanyou, that is a nice title, no? If you like, I can eradicate the other three countries for you, as long as you want it, I will give you this world!"</p>
 <p>He paused and did not give her the opportunity to answer. "Yu'er, think about it, and when you made up your mind, tell someone to get me." He left the room without looking back. Gu Qingyu watched him with despair. She stared at his back and watched him go further and further away.</p>
 <p><em>Yan Zun... what will happen to him?</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Xiao Qin walked in, still smiling. "Miss, I came to help you with your meal."</p>
 <p>"No. I won’t eat." Gu Qingyu refused without thinking.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qin seemed to not hear it. She supported Gu Qingyu up and set a pillow behind her. "Miss, be careful."</p>
 <p>"I've already said I’m not eating." Gu Qingyu couldn't move, she was at Xiao Qin's mercy.</p>
 <p>"Miss, why are you resisting? Is there anything wrong with the emperor?" Xiao Qin picked up the glass of water from the tray. "Since that's the case, let's drink some water."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu opened her eyes in annoyance. "I said I’m..." Her words suddenly got stuck in her throat.</p>
 <p>She saw Xiao Qin dip her fingers into the water and wrote on the table—<em>Miss, I placed the antidote to the Bone Softener in this porridge.</em></p>
 <p><em>Bone Softener... Am I poisoned with Bone Softener? No wonder I can't move.</em></p>
 <p>Xiao Qin continued to write. <em>Please believe me.</em></p>
 <p><em>Well, since there is no other way, let's bet on it!&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qin smiled, picked up the porridge on the table, scooped up a spoonful, and brought it to Gu Qingyu’s lips. Gu Qingyu opened her mouth and swallowed slowly.</p>
 <p>That way, a bowl of porridge slowly bottomed out. Gu Qingyu felt pain spreading inside her body. Anyhow, she was recovering, she could move her hands now.</p>
 <p>She looked at Xiao Qin, mouthing. <em>Why are you helping me?</em></p>
 <p>Xiao Qn continued to write a few words on the table--<em>I know Miss does not have it easy, I know Miss is a good person. I don’t want to see the emperor imprisoning you, and I don’t want him to commit greater sins.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded, dipped her fingers into the water, and wrote on the tabletop—<em>I will leave immediately once I’ve recovered.</em></p>
 <p>Who knows, Xiao Qin shook her head—<em>No, wait for the night.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and smiled.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qin also smiled. She reached out her hand and handed a jade bracelet to Gu Qingyu. <em>If Miss went out, could she hand this over to a storyteller on the corner of Ancheng in Nanyou?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took the bracelet and replied--<em>Of course.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The sky had darkened, Gu Qingyu also felt that her physical strength was almost restored, so she got up and bid farewell to Xiao Qin.</p>
 <p>"The Imperial Palace’s gates will close in an hour’s time. Miss must leave before then." Xiao Qin shook Gu Qingyu's hand.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded, also holding Xiao Qin's hand. "I know, thank you. Do you...want to come with me?"</p>
 <p>"No," Xiao Qin shook her head bitterly. "I can't go."</p>
 <p>"Why?" Gu Qingyu was puzzled.</p>
 <p>"All of the emperor’s people demonstrated their loyalty by taking medicine. Should the emperor be displeased, then when he wants us to die, we must die." Xiao Qin sighed. "And Miss, are you not afraid of me dragging you down?"</p>
 <p>"Of course not, you saved me." Gu Qingyu shook her head. "If that’s the case, take care! If you really want to go, I will definitely come back for you with an antidote!"</p>
 <p>"Take care, Miss." Xiao Qin smiled and did not respond to Gu Qingyu's last sentence. Gu Qingyu nodded and walked out.</p>
 <p>Fluffy white ears emerged from the top of her head, and her tail swished and swayed behind her. Gu Qingyu felt that her hearing, sense of smell and her sight had improved greatly. She jumped gently and landed on top of a wall. When she got to the backyard, she carefully slipped down the side of the wall and landed back on the ground. Suddenly, her ears wriggled. A group of people was heading her way, their footsteps sounded like patrolling soldiers. She looked around, her eyes locked on a tree, and she leaped onto the branches.</p>
 <p>The patrolling soldiers passed her by in a hurry, but there were fewer soldiers than she expected. <em>I wonder if Mo Bai is too trusting of Xiao Qin?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>She waited for them to disappear past the corner before jumping off the tree. Xiao Qin had drawn a map for her, she followed it and ran to the gates. <em>Less than an hour left.&nbsp;</em>Her toes lightly touched the floor, she ran without making a sound. her hair whipped in the air, her robes were flying behind her, she did not stop.</p>
 <p>There were no guards at the gates. Now, there is only one thing left on her mind. <em>Find Ye Jin! He must be alive!`</em></p>
 <p>Before she could cross the threshold, the world around her spun and her strength was sapped away in an instant. She collapsed, but even then, she reached towards the gate.</p>
 <p>Everything faded to black.</p>

 <p>Honestly, this chapter feels like the perfect place to end on before going on hiatus. It almost feels like the season finale, leaving behind questions and plotlines to be answered when the series returns. On that note, thank you for all your support. ACA will now go on hiatus and I will return with season 2 (or should it be season 3?) in July.</p>
