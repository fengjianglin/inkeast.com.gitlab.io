 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu averted her eyes to the floor. “Stop looking at me like that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, I’ll believe you this once.” He held up his sword and wiped it leisurely with a cloth. “If we’re leaving soon, then we have to go stock up on supplies first. We need multiple teams, and each team will have a list of things to buy.” He put away his sword. “Let’s draw sticks,” he said, swiped his hand across the air, and six blue-coloured bamboo sticks appeared, circling above the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone turned simultaneously to look at Gu Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh... I’ll pick first?” She reached out her hand as tactful as possible, then picked the one closest to her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As the saying goes, 『Sometimes what seems to be the most dangerous, may just be the safest』~~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The moment she touched the bamboo stick, it formed into a symbol.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Gu Qingyu had received her sign, everyone else picked a straw until none remained.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is in a team with me?” Gu Qingyu looked around curiously. She was hoping for either Mo Bai or Xiao Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe took turn and looked at each and every symbol, then his expressionless face turned to her, “Me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can....” Gu Qingyu mumbled glumly, “I stay here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.” His answer came quick and clean.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a quick answer!... My heart is breaking...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded stiffly at him, then looked up blankly at Xiao Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It seems that I ended up with Young Master Qi.” Xiao Qi looked back at her blankly, blinking, indicating that she had it worse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu suddenly felt better.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If Xiao Qi is with Qi Yichen, then what remains is Mo Bai with Murong Zuoyu? Hmm, it’s actually quite peaceful like this...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>T/N: If only she knew...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do we need?” She looked at Jia Qizhe, “Just tell everyone their tasks and we can get moving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm,” he nodded dully. “Our current wrapping cloths are getting worn-out, so we’ll need new ones. Mo Bai, your team will be responsible for those, and you may go purchase any herbs or other ingredients too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe continued, “Xiao Qi, you and Qi Yichen will be responsible for all provision needed for our journey.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Food?” Gu Qingyu immediately protested, “Why is Qi Yichen responsible for our food? Can’t I go instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe in his unyielding manner replied again, “No. We’ll be buying other daily necessities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t we change tasks with them then?” she asked with anticipation written all over her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Gu Qingyu walked up to Qi Yichen in silence. “Qi Yichen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes? What can I do for you, Brother Zhu?” He was in high spirits since he already knew what she wanted to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qi Yi... I mean, brother Qi~” she tried her best to ingratiate herself with him. “While you’re at it, could you also bring something for me? I’m not asking for much! Stop looking at me like that, really!” Then she went rambling on endlessly, “You could just bring me some roasted chestnuts, tanghulu, mutton skewers, steamed buns...” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, she finished telling him her wish list of food, and Qi Yichen nodded assent to her request. He had a vague idea of what she wanted him to bring, “Mmm, don’t worry. I got it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt much better hearing his affirmation for her request. As to why she had chosen to ask Qi Yichen over Xiao Qi is because he was more reliable in this aspect. Xiao Qi was easily excitable and could forget things in the heat of the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, we’re off.” Mo Bai stood up from the table and swung his sleeves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wore a long white robe with large loose sleeves, with his long jet-black hair loose over his shoulders. He looked very meek and docile. Sometimes, Gu Qingyu thought that Mo Bai was more suited towards being a scholar than a doctor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ok.” Jia Qizhe nodded and got up to leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Farewell, everyone. See you at noon.” Qi Yichen waved his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, see you then.” Gu Qingyu turned to Mo Bai, “Byebye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bai-bai?” For a moment his eyes seemed puzzled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu laughed, and then quickly explained, “Haha... that’s how we say ‘goodbye’ back where I am from~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, hehe,” Mo Bai laughed also. “Byebye.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, you learn fast~” Gu Qingyu turned around, “Haaa? That asshole! Where did he go again??”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She ran out of the inn and saw Jia Qizhe in the distance, “Heeeeeey! Wait for meeeeeee!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>They wandered around the bustling streets, pausing to visit the shops and look at the stalls. The street cries of the merchants could be heard everywhere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jia Qizhe, Jia Qizhe~, I want that one~!” Gu Qingyu’s eyes were sparkling brightly and intently fixed on a bracelet. “Nnn~ Can you get it for me~?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why would you want to buy that?” He walked at a relaxed pace with his arms crossed in front of his chest. “Brother~ Zhuuuu~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yikes, stop butchering my pretty name.” She curled her lips, “I want it because I am a girl, okay?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe replied with a casual air, “But you’re a young man right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ahhh,” she wailed but could only watch on helplessly as the bracelet moved further and further away. “No! Don’t leave me~~~” She grasped her chest, reaching out for it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can’t understand it.” He let out a sigh. “Why do all women like these so much?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We wear them to catch people’s attention! They make us prettier!” she replied naturally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As it sounded even more absurd to him, Jia Qizhe said, “Drawing people’s attention to you is easy! You just have to roll around in a mud pool, and I can assure you’ll get a head-turning rate of a hundred percent. Then if you want to get prettier, you simply just have to wash away the mud from your face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” She didn’t know if she should cry or laugh. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why am I even acquainted with this person?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We don’t know each other. See! You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she was about to leave, she heard Jia Qizhe’s voice behind, “Boss, how much is this?”</span></p>
