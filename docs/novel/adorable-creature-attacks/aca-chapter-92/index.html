 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu smiled, "Do you feel bad, Ye Jin?"</p>
 <p>"Of course I feel bad! Does your hands not hurt?" Ye Jin's eyes were full of anger.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu saw Ye Ya hiding behind Ye Jin with a sly grin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It hurts!" Gu Qingyu nodded and looked at Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin snorted coldly. "You don't even know how to take care of yourself when I'm away! Don't you know that this worries me?"</p>
 <p>"...Ga?" Gu Qingyu’s thoughts grinded to a halt.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin closed his eyes, and when he opened it again, it was already calm. He covered her hands with his own, "Xiao Yu'er, next time, just let someone do this on behalf of you. Why do you have to be so angry and hurt yourself?" His voice is soft. Ye Ya's face was full of incredulous expressions.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's face is also full of incredulous expressions. "What are you saying?"</p>
 <p>"Your hand must be very painful." Ye Jin rubbed Gu Qingyu's hands. "Why won't you take care of yourself? I really hate it when you injure yourself like that."</p>
 <p><em>Injure myself? I didn't mishear right, I slapped someone and he calls it injuring myself?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled awkwardly. "I'm fine."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, I'm sorry I'm late." Ye Jin pressed Gu Qingyu into his arms, "Tell me, how did she bully you?"</p>
 <p>Ye Ya's eyes widened “Why? Why? Big Brother Ye Jin!”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was even more embarrassed. She looked at Ye Ya, whose face had turned stingingly red. It looked more like she bullied Ye Ya.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Even though she was awkward and embarrassed, Gu Qingyu grimaced and relaxed into Ye Jin's arms. "Xiao Zhezhe! She said that the person you always loved was her!"</p>
 <p>"Oh? Why don't I know?" Ye Jin squinted slightly, he didn't look at Ye Ya, "Men."</p>
 <p>Crow walked in immediately, and his smiley mask made his thoughts unreadable.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin tilted his head slightly, and Crow stepped forward and grabbed Ye Ya.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Big Brother Ye Jin! Big Brother Ye Jin!" Ye Ya immediately cried out, "Why! Why do you treat Ya'er like this!"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, how do you want to deal with her?" Ye Jin looked at Gu Qingyu and smiled with charm.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu thought for a while. "Well..." It seems quite difficult to make a decision.</p>
 <p>"I don't want to see her again." Ye Jin looked at Gu Qingyu with a serious expression. "And I don't want to see you angry again."</p>
 <p>As soon as his words fell, Crow immediately covered Ye Ya's mouth and dragged her away. Her muffled cries followed them. Gu Qingyu released the breath she was holding as she watched Ye Ya disappear though the door.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"What's the matter, Xiao Yu'er? Why do you look so sullen?" Ye Jin rubbed Gu Qingyu's head.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu pursed her lips. "To be honest, I was really scared at that time."</p>
 <p>She was gambling on Ye Jin's heart. If Ye Jin didn't believe her, he would definitely side with Ye Ya; if Ye Jin believed her, he would naturally teach Ye Ya a lesson. Therefore, when Ye Jin's face was cold and there was a little anger in his eyes, Gu Qingyu felt that she had fallen into a frozen fjord.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't be afraid, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin touched Gu Qingyu's head, "I will never leave you, nor will I let you leave me."</p>
 <p>He paused for a while, then placed his hand on her cheek and stared into her eyes. Ye Jin's eyes were full of seriousness and affection: "Xiao Yu'er, I love you."</p>
 <p>Love, not 'like'. Gu Qingyu stared back at him and finally, her lips curled slightly. "Yeah! I...I love you too." Ye Jin's smile was as bright as the sun.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Jin took an obsidian whistle out of his sleeve and gently hung it in her neck. "Blow it when you miss me. It's too much of a hassle to find someone to come get me."</p>
 <p>"Sure." Gu Qingyu nodded, stared at the obsidian whistle and smiled.</p>
 <p>"I'll try to get things done tomorrow. But just call me whenever you miss me." Ye Jin stretched out his long fingers and gently flicked her forehead. She blinked and nodded.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Jin left the training hall. Gu Qingyu left soon after, Qi Wan was there as soon as she stepped out.</p>
 <p>"Boss, I just heard one of Ye's people say that Ye Jin's sister is back. Have you been bullied by her?" Qi Wan was worried.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook her head. "No, Ye Jin has helped me bully her."</p>
 <p>"Huh, I'm scared to death!" Qi Wan exhaled. "Boss, you're so simple and innocent, you don't know when you are bullied!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu eyed him suspiciously.<em>&nbsp;Am I simple and innocent? Why don't I know it myself?</em></p>
 <p>"Ah, it seems that I am really simple!" Gu Qingyu shook her head. "I wonder if the slaps I gave her just now were too light?"</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Qi Wan froze, "You slapped her?"</p>
 <p>"Huh." Gu Qingyu said with a sigh. "Like the tropes in novels, &nbsp;that white lotus slapped herself as soon as Ye Jin showed up. So, I thought she could use more help to elicit more sympathy, so I lent her my hands and slapped her a few times. "</p>
 <p>"So... what about Jia Qizhe?" Qi Wan swallowed weakly.</p>
 <p>"I was still worried, but he barely looked at Ye Ya." Gu Qingyu thought. "What exactly is his relationship with Ye Ya?"</p>
 <p>"Siblings?" Qi Wan was thinking too. "That can't be right, he shouldn't be so cold if they are actually siblings. When I saw Jia Qizhe walking here all worried and angry, I thought you would have gotten in so much trouble, so I rushed over." He paused. "If Jia Qizhe really sided with Ye Ya, then I'll take you away and blow up this place on the way out!"</p>
 <p>"Thank you, Qi Wan!" Gu Qingyu smiled.</p>
 <p>Thank you for being here with me. To have someone who will stick with you through all sorts of shenanigans. He’s not your lover nor your elder brother. Whenever he has anything, you're the first person that comes to mind. Even if you do something wrong, he will stick by you through thick and thin. And when the two of you fall into a bottomless abyss and thought that you two were going to die, he would hold onto you as tight as he can through the whole fall. He will do everything to make you smile. Compared to you, everything is just a grain of sand. He will do everything he can to get everything you want and bend over and backwards for you. If there is such a boy beside you, please cherish it. By the way, tell him "Thank you".</p>
 <p>Thank you for being this strong shield that allows me to do whatever I want to do. Because with you around, the sky will not fall. Thank you, you may not be my lover, but only you can see my most vulnerable side. We understand each other, and we can know what the other is thinking with a look. I am really grateful to have you.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Wan also grinned slowly. "You don't have to thank me, Boss!"</p>
 <p>"Well!" Gu Qingyu nodded. "Let's go! The scenery looks really nice, we could check it out."</p>
 <p>"Okay~ It's a great honour, Your Majesty!" Qi Wan's eyes turned into half-moons.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After speaking with Crow, Gu Qingyu and Qi Wan walked out of the tower and came to the nearby woods.</p>
 <p>"There doesn't seem to be anything interesting here, aside from the scenery. If only I have a camera!" Gu Qingyu sighed.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan watched Gu Qingyu, frowned, and seemed to be thinking about something. Suddenly, his eyes lit up and walked to a tree. "Boss!"</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu raised her head and looked at Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>"Do you want to hear the voice of nature?" Qi Wan looked very happy.</p>
 <p>"Yeah, speak English." Gu Qingyu leaned against a tree.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan pouted. "Urgh, mood-killer. Well, do you know how to blow leaves?"</p>
 <p>"No." Gu Qingyu shook her head and raised an eyebrow at the same time, "Do you?"</p>
 <p>"Uh-huh!" Qi Wan nodded, jumped up, and settled on one of the branches.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There was a green leaf in his hand, he placed it on his lips and blew gently. The melodious sound followed the wind through the foliage, through the forest, through the river.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu followed the music and looked up at Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>His dark green robe was picked up by the wind, the robe danced in the air, and the sleeve swayed. &nbsp;His long hair was pulled up, and it also rose and fell with the wind. His eyes were slightly closed, and his hair brushed his cheeks repeatedly, and he seemed to be immersed in the moment. Gu Qingyu used to think that Qi Wan belonged to the kind of "flamboyant fancy prince" type, but she didn't expect there to be such an elegant side...</p>
 <p>At the end of the song, Qi Wan lowered the leaf and opened his eyes. His eyes were full of smiles, and he fixed his eyes on Gu Qingyu. "Well, Xiao Yu'er, have you finally fallen for me?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes "There must be a limit to your narcissism."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan laughed and hopped down. "So, Boss, do you want to learn how to do this?"</p>
 <p>"Hell yeah!" Gu Qingyu nodded immediately.</p>
 <p>"Cool." Qi Wan took another leaf from the branch again, wiped it with his sleeve, and handed it to Gu Qingyu, "Yes, put it on your mouth first, and try to copy what I'm doing."</p>
 <p>"... Sure." Gu Qingyu took the leaves.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>Evening</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu sighed. A whole afternoon had passed.</p>
 <p>She glanced annoyingly at Qi Wan, who was rolling on the floor beside her. "Had enough to laugh?"</p>
 <p>"Gahahaha... Boss gahaha...I can’t breathe from all that laughing... Not that I'm really judging you... gahahaha... after an afternoon... the tunes you blow out are getting more and more nice gahaha..." Qi Wan quacked as he rolled on the ground, like a penguin who is about to starve to death.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and kicked Qi Wan. "Oh, get up. Let's go back for dinner."</p>
 <p>"Gaga, what should I do if I can't get up..." Qi Wan was still rolling, and there seemed to be a trend that he would laugh until dawn.</p>
 <p>"Okay, then don't." Gu Qingyu walked back, "Just die from all that laughing, I heard that there will be a lot of demons at night, don't stop."</p>
 <p>"Nonono!" Qi Wan jumped up immediately, catching up while holding his stomach. "Boss, wait for me, gahaha..."</p>

<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p>Sorry for the delay, I planned to at least release these two chapters simultaneously, but as you can see, it’s a little intense. Gu Qingyu has made her choice, and wrote a friend-zone speech that I struggled to translate and capture the mood. The first time I read through ACA in full, I was firmly in Team Jia Qizhe, the two of them do have chemistry and Jia Qizhe’s behaviour reminds me of a lot of familiar, ‘CEO who’s smitten with you without you doing anything’ tropes. But over time, Mo Bai and Qi Wan grew on me, so I am quite conflicted in this chapter. Well, the story is far from over, we will just have to wait and see. </p>
