 <p>After having a 'conversation' with Qi Wan, Gu Qingyu clapped her hands and dragged Qi Wan out of the room. "Go apologise to Mo Bai!"</p>
 <p>"Boss... Why are you so protective of him..." Qi Wan burst into strips of tears. "Help!... I'll go apologise to him, ok?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "Go, I'm waiting for you in my room. There's something I need your help with."</p>
 <p>"Yes, my lord!" Qi Wan whipped around and walked down the hallway. "Brother~ Mo~"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Go away." A cold voice replied in the distance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu laughed with her hand over her mouth as she went upstairs and back to her room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"My dear apprentice." Yan Zun floated slowly through the room. "You haven't listened to what your master has to say."</p>
 <p>"Eh? Is it about Xiqian's grand library?" Gu Qingyu looked at Yan Zun curiously and closed the window.</p>
 <p>Yan Zun nodded, half reclining on Gu Qingyu's bed and played with his hair, twisting and coiling locks of hair around his finger. "Yes, Xiqian has many untold secrets."</p>
 <p>"Well, start talking, Master!" Curiosity lit up in her eyes. "It must be interesting!"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, it is very interesting." Yan Zun nodded as he smiled enchantingly. "That scholar's fan in particular. It's hiding some things even the scholar himself doesn't know about. And, that scholar owes his life to that fan. Without it, god knows how things would have played out that night."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu leaned in. "What do you mean?"</p>
 <p>"Do you have his fan?" Yan Zun gave her a cunning smile. "Oh, there is a person in his fan~"</p>
 <p>"Person?" Gu Qingyu looked at Yan Zun in doubt. "You mean a soul? Like you?"</p>
 <p>"Don't lump us together." Yan Zun huffed disdainfully. "I am actually capable of protecting you in danger."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes, thank you, Master!" Gu Qingyu nodded with minimal appreciation. "What about that person?"</p>
 <p>"The soul dissipated, maybe from overusing its power." Yan Zun sounded indifferent, as if he had been talking about the weather, "After all, it is still too weak. Only about a hundred years of training."</p>
 <p>"Hm... So Qi Yichen doesn't know about her?" Gu Qingyu felt sorry for the unnamed soul.</p>
 <p>Yan Zun shook his head. "He is different from you, and that person is also different from me. I chose you, and I have the power to actually let you see me."</p>
 <p>"Huh." Gu Qingyu pursed her lips. "Master, can you save her?"</p>
 <p>Yan Zun shrugged and released the locks of hair. "You may be able to exist in a different form after death. But if the soul itself disappears, there is nothing that can be done."</p>
 <p>"I know, thank you, Master." Gu Qingyu nodded slowly as she digested that information. "So that's the big secret in Xiqian's grand library?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No, hardly." Yan Zun raised an eyebrow. "There's still..."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Boss!" Qi Wan broke into the room. "I'm here!" Yan Zun disappeared in that second.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Dammit!" <em>Again, really?</em></p>
 <p>"What's wrong with you, Boss?" Qi Wan looked at Gu Qingyu with a puzzled expression. "Didn't you ask me to come here?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu nodded with a sigh.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan saluted. "I have apologised to Brother Mo! How else can I be of service?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Spar with me." Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan sincerely. "I don't think you will refuse such a tiny request!"</p>
 <p>"Of course not!" Qi Wan said immediately. "Let's go, right now. To an empty spot?"</p>
 <p>"Well, okay, do you know where that would be?" Gu Qingyu questioned.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded. "Of course! Come with me!" He jumped out of the window.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was in a daze as she watched Qi Wan jump down without a shred of hesitation. A loud 'thud' came from below. She finally said, "Jesus, wow, this may be the second floor but it's still much taller than the tree outside..."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She decided to take the stairs instead. As expected, Qi Wan waited for her downstairs with a sullen expression, something was stuck to his messy hair.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Let's go!" Gu Qingyu while stifling a laugh. &nbsp;Qi Wan nodded and went out sulking.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They arrived at an empty lot. Gu Qingyu's Soul Chain slowly appeared and circled her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I always feel that your weapon is a bit scary, Boss..." Qi Wan hugged himself. "Every time I see it, I feel cold, like there's a sudden gust or something..."</p>
 <p>"Oh." Gu Qingyu shrugged indifferently. "It's probably not a big deal. Let's get started, Qi Wan. "</p>
 <p>He nodded, and a ribbon flew out of his sleeve.</p>
 <p>She was still careful, even if the opponent was Qi Wan. She held the chain with one hand and struck. He jumped up immediately, and his ribbons flew out one after another. He dropped gracefully and stood on top of the Soul Chain as the ribbons were sent flying towards her.</p>
 <p>She immediately bent over, the ribbon brushed over her head, but not without a slight graze.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The other end of the chain flew out and hit Qi Wan. He twirled in the air, then stood on his ribbon. The spinning momentum caused the other end of the ribbon to coil and wrap around Gu Qingyu and pulled her towards him.</p>
 <p><em>Every one of them is so powerful ...</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu made a last stand. She extended her sleeve arrow and released a bolt at the ribbon that pulled her towards Qi Wan. However, the ribbon simply dodged the bolt. Then, it wrapped around her crossbow sleeve, making it impossible for her to fire another bolt.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right then, Qi Wan came to Gu Qingyu's side and held her by the waist with a wide grin on his face. "How was it, beautiful?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu slapped away his hand and kept her chains. Qi Wan's ribbon also returned to his sleeves. "What's the matter? Boss, are you unhappy?" Qi Wan smiled cheekily. "Why don't we continue, I'll let you win this time?"</p>
 <p>"Get off." Gu Qingyu walked away. "You are also very powerful, it seems that I really need to practice more."</p>
 <p>"I'm more than glad to spar with you again!" Qi Wan nodded obediently. "Whenever, wherever. You can always find me if you want more practice."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu looked into the distance. "The sightseeing was a good idea, we can finally take a proper break."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes, let's just all have fun, Boss!" Qi Wan saluted.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Without realising, they had walked back to the inn. By the time they returned, it was already evening. Mo Bai stood by the entrance of the inn. He smiled gently when he saw Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What is the feeling of a wife waiting for her husband to return home...</em></p>
 <p>Mo Bai walked up to Gu Qingyu and Qi Wan. "Yu'er, he's about to wake up."</p>
 <p>"Really?" Gu Qingyu nodded in surprise. "Can I see him?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After getting Mo Bai's permission, Gu Qingyu immediately ran upstairs to Qi Yichen's room. His eyes were still closed, but his fingers twitched a little. Without hurry, Gu Qingyu found a stool and sat near his bed. Before long, he slowly opened his eyes.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Yichen's eyes were glazed for a while, then it gradually focused.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He looked at Gu Qingyu, there was a strain in the way he tugged the corners of his lips. "Qingyu."</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu answered. For some reason, tears were starting to well up in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>For someone so just and uncorrupt, he would have no trouble assuming the throne. He would have made a fine king, actually. And yet, he willingly gave everything for that man, without asking for anything in return. And the person in his fan... also ended in tragedy.</em></p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Qi Yichen suddenly laughed. He lifted his hand and tucked a strand of hair behind her ear. "Qingyu, I'm sorry."</p>
 <p>"You don't have to apologise. You don't have to say anything, Qi Yichen." She placed her hand on top of his. "I saved you, not for you to do anything more reckless. Qi Yichen, I just want you to be yourself." Although her words were a bit confusing, she believed that with Qi Yichen's intelligence, he would understand her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He nodded. "Didn't the Prime Minister of Xiqian die that night?" He was referring to when Zhi Wei stabbed him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu laughed at his reply, her laughter was mixed with a sigh of relief.</p>
 <p><em>Does this mean that he's moving on? Or, should I say, moving forward?</em></p>
 <p>Qi Yichen lowered his hand, still smiling. "Where is the next stop?"</p>
 <p>"Sightseeing." Gu Qingyu took out his fan from her sleeve. "Don't forget this, and remember to use it."</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen took the fan. "Okay."</p>
 <p>"Here, have some porridge first." Gu Qingyu lifted the bowl of porridge from the table, scooped a spoonful and held the spoon against his lips. Right now Qi Yichen was like a newly born child, dazed, lost and a little ignorant. He was going to need some guidance. Qi Yichen opened his mouth very obediently and ate the porridge. Gu Qingyu nodded in satisfaction and as she brought another scoop. Soon, Qi Yichen finished the bowl of porridge. Gu Qingyu was surprised by his good appetite.</p>
 <p>"Rest well. Tomorrow we'll visit a couple of scenic locations. It will also make your body recover faster. Don't worry, me and Mo Bai are here. Nothing would go wrong." She gave him another faint smile. "Good night."</p>
 <p>She left his room with the empty bowl and closed the door gently. As the door closed, she heard him whisper, "Good night."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Boss," Qi wan came up to her as soon as she left Qi Yichen's room. "Actually, I was injured."</p>
 <p>"What happened to you this time?" Gu Qingyu stared at him impatiently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It hurts here!" He placed his hand over his heart. "I want you to feed me porridge too!"</p>
 <p>"Go away." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and shoved the bowl into his hand. "Go wash it."</p>
 <p>"I have to wash this too?" Qi Wan looked at Gu Qing incredulously, "Boss, I'm Qi Wan, are you sure you didn't mix me up for someone else?"</p>
 <p>"No, seven thousand, seventy hundred, Qi Wan, not wrong!" Gu Qingyu nodded. "I'm going to bed first, just get it done!"</p>
 <p>"But...." Qi Wan bemoaned and walked out silently with the bowl.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu waved at him, satisfied, and walked upstairs.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan sulked as he did the dishes. "Oh, what kind of world is this? The handsome Qi Wan has to do the dishes, what else is possible?"</p>
 <p>"This!" A big man next to him showed him a pair of swollen lips. "I just took a sip of water and this happened!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan winced as he nodded and gave the man a thumbs up. "Cool!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Meanwhile, with Qi Wan out of her hair, and Qi Yichen all safe and sound, Gu Qingyu could finally continue her conversation with Yan Zun, about the secrets and mysteries hidden in Xiqian.</p>
