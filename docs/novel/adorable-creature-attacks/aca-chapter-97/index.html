 <p><em>But even this is impossible... The top intelligence organisation! The leading assassination organisation! Just kidding!</em></p>
 <p>"Can't think of it?" Ye Jin gently touched Gu Qingyu's head, "killed?"</p>
 <p>Nightingale could feel the cold sweat coming out of her back. The leader's methods often made people long for death. And she also understood the difference in value between her and the woman in front of her. Compared to this woman, she couldn't even count as a grain of sand.</p>
 <p>"I don't mean that, Xiao Zhezhe." Gu Qingyu also touched Ye Jin's face. <em>Huh? Why does it feel so good?</em> Seeing Ye Jin didn't seem to be angry, Gu Qingyu simply took advantage of the opportunity and caressed his face a few more times. "After all, it is your men. You do have the power to dispose of her, but it is a bit too much.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Well, okay, I know." Ye Jin reached up and covered her hand with his own, and his voice cooled down in the next second, "Nightingale, from now on, you shall not appear before me." Gu Qingyu glanced at Nightingale, and suddenly felt that Ye Jin was too kind, too trusting to her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes." Nightingale's face was pale, and she retreated.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe..." Gu Qingyu looked at him with some guilt, "Why do you do this?"</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Ye Jin looked at her tenderly, not aware of what she was referring to.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I... why do you ... indiscriminately or even unreasonably side with me?" Gu Qingyu lowered her head. Although she was very happy and did not feel bad in this way, she would not say "Don't be so good to me" like pitiful characters on television, but Ye Jin really... no matter whether it is Ye Ya or Nightingale, he was completely biased towards her&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Because, between logic and my wife, I can only choose one." Ye Jin smiled with a smile on his face, "Xiao Yu'er, you asked me that yourself."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's face reddened. <em>I did, but!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Jin laughed at her flushed face. "You are so cute, Xiao Yu'er. Stop worrying about it, come up with me."</p>
 <p>"But... is it okay?" Gu Qingyu raised her head. Nightingale said Ye Jin was working on something highly confidential. But his tone was relaxed and calm...</p>
 <p>"If it's you, of course you can join me." A faint smile graced his lips as he gently lifted a strand of hair in front of Gu Qingyu's forehead with her hands, and tucked it behind her ear.</p>
 <p>And as he grew satisfied with the sight of her burning, red face, he chuckled and walked forward. Gu Qingyu smacked her face angrily before she kept up with Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They went up the stairs, and stopped at a door. Ye Jin pushed the door open, and leaned back, making way for Gu Qingyu to enter. Gu Qingyu also smiled at Ye Jin and walked in.</p>
 <p>As soon as they entered the room, she saw a pile of papers lying on Ye Jin's table. Gu Qingyu blinked curiously, and then looked back at Ye Jin who had entered the door, and sat on the chair beside him. As she looked up, she saw a person sitting opposite her, with a beautiful face and dark hair. The man nodded at her, and Gu Qingyu immediately sat up straight.</p>
 <p>"You don't have to be so restrained, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin smiled. "Things might get boring for a while, but I have a library here. If you are interested, you can check it out."</p>
 <p>"Ah? Oh, good..." Gu Qingyu looked at the man opposite with curiosity. He looked at Ye Jin, as if he had something to say.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stood up, Ye Jin tapped on the table gently, and at the same time, Gu Qingyu heard a snap and a door opened behind her.</p>
 <p>"Go, I'll be right here." Ye Jin leaned on the chair and flashed his trademark, charming smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately covered her nose and ducked into the library.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as Gu Qingyu entered the library, she was shocked by the sight in front of her. Rows after rows of neatly-arranged books, the smell of paper and ink permeated the air. It was a real library! Gu Qingyu looked curiously from left to right, picked up a book and flipped through it gently. She looked up and saw Yan Zun floating in the air. Yan Zun leaned down, his chin settled on the crook of her neck. &nbsp;"Well, this book is very rare. I did not expect that it would be here."</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu murmured and found that the book was about the Frost Poison.</p>
 <p>Yan Zun floated around the library, and finally returned to Gu Qingyu's side. "Apprentice, your teacher found that there are some long-lost books here~ And," he paused, "And, most of them are on the most hidden secrets in Ye."</p>
 <p>"That dramatic?" Gu Qingyu's eyes widened. No wonder the man outside looked like he wanted to say something.</p>
 <p>"Well, it is quite exhilarating." Yan Zun narrowed his eyes and smiled, "Have a flip through, it would help you a lot~"</p>
 <p>"Em... Does Ye Jin... trust me too much?" Gu Qingyu hesitated and continued to read the book about Frost Poison.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You deserve his trust, don't you?" Yan Zun rubbed Gu Qingyu's head.</p>
 <p>"That's right ..." Gu Qingyu suddenly turned the page and read out a passage. "The Frost Poison can only be cured by the Frost Lotus that blooms on the Frozen Mountain?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah," Yan Zun nodded. "But this lotus is very rare. Like the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny, there are countless people who want to take it, but they have not found it. Instead, they all found the Frozen Mountain to be their final resting place."</p>
 <p>"Hm." Gu Qingyu closed the book gently and put it back to its original position.</p>
 <p>"Do you want to find it?" He read her thoughts.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu nodded, "I... ow!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Before her words were finished, Yan Zun had flicked her forehead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don’t think about what’s not there, that’s not what you should think about. Do you think you can do it by yourself? Do you know how much people Ye has invested in the Frozen Mountain in recent years? None of them came back." Yan Zun looked at Gu Qingyu with a stern, berating glare.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu blinked. "But that's their business, it has nothing to do with me, right?"</p>
 <p>"But Ye Jin's matters involve you?" Yan Zun raised an eyebrow. "You know, Ye Jin is not an ordinary person."</p>
 <p>"I'm not an ordinary person." Gu Qingyu muttered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You know that's not what your master meant." Yan Zun sighed and rubbed her head. "Are you sure that this is all the great leader of Ye is? Just the head of an intelligence organisation?"</p>
 <p>His sentence set off a lightbulb in her head, and her eyes sank.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Under Yan Zun's unwavering gaze, Gu Qingyu's expression showed a smile. "Perhaps."</p>
 <p>"How? Have you figured it out?" Yan Zun smiled.</p>
 <p>"Well," Gu Qingyu nodded and shook his head again, "If he wants to, he would tell me eventually." Yan Zun sighed softly and disappeared in the air. Gu Qingyu turned around and saw Ye Jin standing behind her. <em>How much did he hear?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The sudden realisation that he had been there had left an awkward atmosphere between them. "Jia Qizhe, when did you get here?"</p>
 <p>"Just now." Ye Jin smiled and came over, pressing Gu Qingyu's arms in her arms, just like usual.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"That, I ..." Gu Qingyu stammered, she was not sure if Ye Jin had heard it.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin stroked her head. "I heard everything." <em>He heard it! He heard everything!&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu instantly wanted to smack her head against the bookcase, but considering the durability of the bookcase, she wisely chose to lower her head and avoid Ye Jin's eyes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Look at me, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin held up her face gently and stared into her eyes. &nbsp;"Xiao Yu'er, listen carefully. Everything I am about to say comes from the bottom of my heart. Yes. I want you to know everything about me. "</p>
 <p>"Uh-Huh." Gu Qingyu also nodded and met his gaze.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He said he wanted to let her know everything about him.</p>
 <p>"I am the martial arts hero Jia Qizhe, the leader Ye Jin and the Shadow of the monarchs, Ye Jin" He gently caressed her cheek.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"The Shadow of the Monarchs?" Gu Qingyu blinked her eyes in doubt.</p>
 <p>"Yes." Ye Jin hooked his lips, revealing a charming smile, "It can be said that the whole world is in my hands."</p>
 <p>"It's so exciting?" Gu Qingyu's eyes widened. "Wouldn't that mean that I have a chance to wreak havoc?"</p>
 <p>"If you want, I can give you the world." His thumb brushed over her cheekbones.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's face quickly became red again. That would not be necessary, I won't be able to bear such grievous crimes."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin laughed. "Xiao Yu'er, I'm right here, who would dare to even accuse you?"</p>
 <p>"You have a point..." She pursed her lips. "But, going back, what does the Shadow of the monarchs mean?"</p>
 <p>"Every country's heirs must show absolute obedience to the Shadow. The Shadow is not the emperor, but his authority is greater than kings and emperors." Ye Jin slowly lowered his hand and shifted to hold her hand instead. "And you, Xiao Yu'er, have authority over the Shadow. Even I must absolutely obey you."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled embarrassedly. "Xiao Zhezhe, how did you become such a romantic overnight?"</p>
 <p>"Why, you don't like it?" Ye Jin leaned into her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No, not..." Gu Qingyu shook her head immediately. "I ..."</p>
 <p>"So you like it?" Ye Jin laughed loudly.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu glared at him and stormed out with a huff. Ye Jin followed behind her, still grinning from ear to ear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Back in Ye Jin’s office, Gu Qingyu heard a knock on the door.</p>
 <p>"Come in," Ye Jin said, pulling out a chair for Gu Qingyu. "Xiao Yu'er, here."</p>
 <p>Wind, Lightning and Thunder, who just entered the room, had eyes as wide as saucers. Gu Qingyu was also not discreet, and sat down on the chair.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, are you angry?" Ye Jin looked at Gu Qingyu with a bit of curiosity. Gu Qingyu blushed, and turned away. Wind, Lightning and Thunder were all confused. <em>What in the world happened to their leader? </em></p>
