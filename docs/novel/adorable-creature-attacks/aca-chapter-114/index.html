 <p>Gu Qingyu sensed that she had fallen into an unfamiliar realm, everything around her was dark.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Where is this place? This is so annoying. I could only make out anything within half a meter, based on the tiny bit of light from me. What is going on?</em></p>
 <p>It seemed that she felt something in the midst, and she suddenly turned around and saw another light. It's Yan Zun.</p>
 <p>"Master?" A grin immediately split across her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes." Yan Zun sauntered towards her as if nothing in the world could cause him to hurry. "You've not seen me for days, did you miss me?"</p>
 <p>"Days?" Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "It's only two days. Say Master, what is this place?"</p>
 <p>"This is a place that allows your teacher to communicate with you." Yan Zun smiled and charmed, "but in order to get here, you will need to be able to sense me."</p>
 <p>"And I did! I sensed you!"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, otherwise how would you be here?" Yan Zun looked very satisfied, he reached out and stroked her head. "Stupid apprentice, well done."</p>
 <p>"What should we do next?" Gu Qingyu asked, "Master, I thought you're really powerful, how did Mo Bai manage to seal you?"</p>
 <p>"I let my guard down." Yan Zun sighed. "I didn't think that person would give the one thing that could seal me again to the royal family of Nanyou."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu said, surprised. "Seal you again?"</p>
 <p>"Well, things are better this time. The Emperor of Nanyou didn't use that thing at the moment, but I would not want to deal with that at all, even with my current strength." Yan Zun narrowed his eyes, clearly annoyed.</p>
 <p>"Master, I will rescue you!" Gu Qingyu declared as she looked at Yan Zun. "Please believe me. This is also a good opportunity to train myself. I can do this, on my own, without you by my side." &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yan Zun smiled. "Okay, then make me proud."</p>
 <p>"Well!" Gu Qingyu nodded with a smile, "Wait for me, Master!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The darkness dispersed and ushered in blinding light. Gu Qingyu slowly opened her eyes. Mo Bai was very close to herself. He was leaning down and staring right into her face. That surprised Gu Qingyu and she let out a yelp. Mo Bai laughed as he straightened himself. "Yu'er, I tried waking you several times, nothing worked. You gave me a scare."</p>
 <p>"Ah? Really?" Gu Qingyu thought on her feet. "Maybe I'm just too tired."</p>
 <p>"Then go and get some proper sleep. Don't force yourself to stay up with me." Mo Bai gently stroked her head.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Um..." Gu Qingyu looked at the brightly lit hall, and then out of the window, the sky had gone completely dark. She was asleep for a really long time. She stood up and stretched. Then, she caught a peek at his desk, reports still piled the table. "Mo Bai, have you been reading these reports this whole time?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah." He nodded.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at him with some surprise. "Aren't you tired?"</p>
 <p>"You're here with me, so I'm not tired." Mo Bai stroked Gu Qingyu's head again. "Come on, Yu'er. You must be hungry."</p>
 <p>She would not have realised if he had not mentioned it, her stomach was rumbling a little. She nodded vigorously. "Yeah, I'm hungry!"</p>
 <p>Mo Bai laughed softly. "Let's go."</p>
 <p>He took her hand and led her out of the study. His gentle big palm wrapped hers, it was firm and determined.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Mo Bai, is this what you have always wanted? To have your loved ones stay by your side forever, and never leave you again. So you choose to hold onto them tightly and never let go. What a contradictory and determined person you are.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After dinner, Mo Bai sent Gu Qingyu back to her room.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, sleep earlier today, and we will head out tomorrow." Mo Bai looked at Gu Qingyu tenderly, and his face appeared soft under the sway of the light.</p>
 <p>"Okay..." Gu Qingyu nodded and smiled.</p>
 <p>After watching Mo Bai leave the room, Gu Qingyu turned around and sat on a stool instead.</p>
 <p><em>I need to do something, we are already heading out tomorrow. Or, Nanyou would be destroyed at this rate. Even if Mo Bai is even more powerful, he can only support one side, what about other places? Time and tide waits for no man, he's not gonna make it. Now there is no one else to rely on but myself.</em></p>
 <p>Suddenly, there was a soft rustling right above her, she looked up immediately. A dark green robe descended from the sky.</p>
 <p>"Boss, it's me!" Qi Wan looked at Gu Qingyu with a wide grin.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu pretended to look at him suspiciously. "Who are you?"</p>
 <p>"You... really don't recognise me?" Qi Wan's expression collapsed. For a moment, he seemed forlorn but he quickly recovered. "We met before, allow me to introduce myself. I’m Qi Wan, your husband!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was speechless, only Qi Wan would be this shameless.</p>
 <p>"Why, are you so surprised to learn that a handsome guy like me is your husband? You're so elated that you can't speak? Oh, my dear, don't be like this, that's embarrassing me!" Qi Wan reached out his hand and put on a posture that he thought was very handsome, and even flicked his hair. "Come, baby! Leap into your husband's arms! I will take you out of here!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Enough, you can leave now." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Are you itching for a spanking after such a long while?"</p>
 <p>"Eh?" Qi Wan suddenly raised his head and stared at her. "Boss, didn't you lose your memories?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smacked her forehead. "Come on, even my amnesia would be cured from that level of stimulation and shouting."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan suddenly stretched out his arms and hugged Gu Qingyu tightly. "I thought you would never remember me again!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu felt that his body was trembling slightly and he sounded as though he was sobbing. She reached over and patted his back gently. "Okay, it's okay. Thank you, Qi Wan. Thank you for worrying about me, and thank you for bringing back my memories. Do you know? If I didn't see you, I probably wouldn't remember."</p>
 <p>"Me?" Qi Wan raised his head and looked at Gu Qingyu, his expression was surprised, "Me?"</p>
 <p>"Uh-huh." Gu Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>"Wow ha ha ha Boss, you actually love me so ha ha ha ha..." Qi Wan laughed heartily, his eyes full of joy.</p>
 <p>"Go away." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and pushed him away. "It's dangerous here! The whole palace is crawling with Mo Bai's men, do you have a death wish or something?"</p>
 <p>"Boss! Death is a worthy risk if I could see you again." Qi Wan's expression was affectionate.</p>
 <p>"I actually believed it." Gu Qingyu pouted. "Okay, I'm not kidding, it's really dangerous here. Get going! It'll be really bad if you get caught."</p>
 <p>"Boss, can I take this as you worrying about me?" Qi Wan chuckled.</p>
 <p>"Ah, read it as such." Gu Qingyu replied perfunctorily then thought carefully, and instructed, "Also, notify everyone else to stop the battle and come to the Imperial City."</p>
 <p>"Yes, my lord!" Qi Wan saluted. Suddenly, his eyes steeled and immediately stepped forward to grab Gu Qingyu's hand, "Come with me!"</p>
 <p>He gently pinched Gu Qingyu's hand, and Gu Qingyu immediately understood his signal. Mo Bai was here, and there was no time left to hide.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>He would rather expose himself to danger and give up the opportunity to escape, all while knowing that he will definitely be caught if he stays than run away and cause Mo Bai's suspicion. Gu Qingyu felt her eyes stung a little, but when she felt the cold air approaching behind her, she struggled against Qi Wan's grip. "No! I'm going to find Mo Bai!" Mo Bai must not be allowed to find that she has recovered her memory, otherwise everything would go to waste!</p>
 <p>"Yu'er!" Mo Bai's voice came and sent a huge wave of energy flying towards Qi Wan. Qi Wan sidestepped, but he did not manage to dodge it entirely. Blood trickled out of the corner of his lips.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It pained her to see him hurt, but Gu Qingyu stepped back to Mo Bai's side. "Mo Bai, let him go. He didn't hurt me."</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, are you sure?" Mo Bai looked at her with concern.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook her head. "Yes."</p>
 <p>Mo Bai seemed to be relieved, and then stroked Gu Qingyu's head. "Good, leave it to me. You should go out first, everything will be fine." Then the look in his eyes changed. "Tsing Yi, send the empress to my palace."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Tsing Yi, who had been standing next to him, took two steps forward. Gu Qingyu could tell that he never planned to let Qi Wan go, so she tugged on his sleeve with a whimper. "Mo Bai!"</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Mo Bai turned around and looked at Gu Qingyu, his eyes full of softness. Gu Qingyu shook her head and looked down. Qi Wan seized the opportunity and sent out one of his ribbons. The dark green ribbon wrapped around the beam at the top of the ceiling. But right then, Mo Bai condensed the dark light in his hand into a dagger and threw it at Qi Wan. Qi Wan froze for a moment, then stretched out his other hand. Another ribbon flew out from his sleeve and wrapped up the dagger as he flew towards Mo Bai.</p>
 <p>"Be careful!" Gu Qingyu instinctively blocked Mo Bai and shocked him. He grabbed her and jerked her back. The ribbon sliced open his arm. Qi Wan was also shocked, he didn't mean to injure Mo Bai. But at the very least, Gu Qingyu was safe. He was about to leave when the following scene shocked him to his core.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Blood was gushing out of Gu Qingyu's chest. A dagger pierced through her as Tsing Yi stood behind her with a vicious glare and gritted teeth.</p>
 <p>"Die!" Tsing Yi cursed as Gu Qingyu's expression turned rigid.</p>
 <p>"Boss!" Qi Wan screamed. And before Mo Bai could react, he flew towards Tsing Yi and released all of his power. Ribbons flew out from him at a blinding speed and left gaping holes in Tsing Yi.</p>
