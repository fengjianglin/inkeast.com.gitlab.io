 <p>Reading the situation, Xiao Qi immediately walked away, leaving only Gu Qingyu and Murong Zuoyu.</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu nodded slightly. "I wonder if Brother Zhu knew Murong Qize was killed?"</p>
 <p>"I..." She looked at the horizon in the distance with a guilty conscience.<em>&nbsp;Should I tell him the truth?</em></p>
 <p>He remained silent for a while, and then slowly spoke. "Brother Zhu, was Ye Jin behind it?"</p>
 <p>She raised her head to look at Murong Zuoyu's eyes. His eyes were honest, with their usual coldness. "Yes, Brother Murong, I don't want to hide it from you." She gave a frank nod. He sighed softly, there was no trace of anger, which was not what she had imagined.</p>
 <p>"What's the matter, Brother Murong?" She frowned. <em>After all, Murong Zuoyu sighed for the first time. What could make him sigh?</em></p>
 <p>"There is someone behind him, you need to be more careful." He looked at her, his eyes deadly serious, "I can't find the real identity or details of that man, I just know that he is very strong. Brother Zhu, please be careful. "</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu felt her heart stirred from the concern. "Hmm!" She feigned a relaxed smile. "Aren't you also with me?"</p>
 <p>"Brother Zhu, I will protect you." He had a solemn look in his eyes, he was making a promise to her.</p>
 <p>"Thanks." She also nodded. He gave a faint smile and walked away. His smile is beautiful.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stared dumbly as Murong Zuoyu left. Suddenly, she smelled a faint fragrance mixed with herbal scent. She followed the scent and turned back, Mo Bai was standing behind her, watching her with his gentle eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Mo Bai?" Gu Qingyu was startled. "When did you show up?"</p>
 <p>"Did I scare you? Sorry, Yu'er." Mo Bai said softly.</p>
 <p>"Ah, it's okay, what's wrong?" She smiled back.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, I have found the Frost Lotus you mentioned." He smiled like a child waiting for compliments.</p>
 <p>"What? Really? Where?" She exclaimed and immediately asked.</p>
 <p>"In addition to the Frozen Mountain, there are also some in Nanyou." Mo Bai said with a smile.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and bowed. "Thank you, Doctor Mo! This lady can not possibly repay this great grace and great virtue!"</p>
 <p>"It is a great grace, huh..." Mo Bai's eyes darkened, and then he looked at her and smiled gently. "If you can't repay me with money, you can pay me with your love instead."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu raised her head and looked at him, and saw that there was nothing but a smile in his eyes, so she played it off like a joke. "Okay! We can skip all the trouble by having you married to me, but do give me a big dowry!"</p>
 <p>Mo Bai laughed, "Yu'er..."</p>
 <p>Before he could finish his sentence, they heard Qi Yichen's roar in the distance. "Qi Wan, you bastard! Give me back my fan!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked in the direction of the sound, then shook her head helplessly. "Ah, the two kids are at it again!"</p>
 <p>Mo Bai gave Gu Qingyu a puzzled look. "Kids?"</p>
 <p>“Technically, they’re more like brats" Gu Qingyu nodded, satisfied with her explanation. And then she dragged along Mo Bai by his sleeve. "Come, let's go check it out!"</p>
 <p>"Okay." Mo Bai's eyes were stained with a little smile, and he walked forward with Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Arriving at the "playground" of the two "brats", Gu Qingyu saw Qi Yichen and Qi Wan sitting side by side, one was in green, the other was in white. They were both sitting with their legs raised, munching on sunflower seeds.</p>
 <p>"Can I ask how you two reconciled this time?" Gu Qingyu eyed them curiously. Qi Wan spat out some husks, then nudged Qi Yichen with his elbow. Qi Yichen also spat out a seed husk. The two of them each took out a fan from their sleeves at the same time, and opened them together in synchronisation.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>I am Unparalleled!&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am Invincible!</strong></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"I’ve only realised this just now, but we are really like family. So why must we fight so hard?" Qi Wan sighed, waving his fan.</p>
 <p>"It's too hard!" Qi Yichen also sighed, waving his own fan. Suddenly, his movements stiffened in the air.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at him with concern. "What's wrong with you?"</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen's face slowly turned white, and then he bent over and gagged. "The horrid stench from this fan is still very strong!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan forced a smile and fanned the wind, pretending to be indifferent. "Are thy a fool? This scent is no foul smell! Thy merely need to see things with a closer eye."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen was taken aback for a moment, and then quickly answered. "Thy should take the first sniff, to see the truth of my words."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Thy are a big fool, big fool, big fool! Important things must be repeated three times!" Qi Wan fanned himself.</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen's complexion changed, tossing his fan and pounced on Qi Wan. "You’re the fool!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu silently watched these two "brats" start to "play" again and rolled her eyes. "Mo Bai, do you have some sunflower seeds? Also, a small bench."</p>
 <p>"...What's the use?" Mo Bai looked at Gu Qingyu sceptically, but probably already knew in his heart.</p>
 <p>"To watch the show! Don't you think the days at sea are too boring?" Gu Qingyu stared at Mo Bai matter-of-factly and at the same time, actually moved a small bench over from somewhere. After setting up the seats, she took out some sunflower seeds from her sleeve, sat on the small bench and patted the space beside her. "Come! Don't be shy! Take a seat!"</p>
 <p><em>Can I say no?&nbsp;</em>However, it was not possible, Mo Bai smiled indifferently, gently brushed his sleeve, and also bent down to sit down.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded in satisfaction, took out a melon seed to eat, and handed some to Mo Bai. <em>Can I not take it?&nbsp;</em>However, it was not possible, Mo Bai smiled indifferently, stretched out his fair-white hands, and took over the seeds in Gu Qingyu's hands.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded with satisfaction, and at the same time stooped down to pick up Qi Wan and Qi Yichen's fans on the ground and handed one to Mo Bai.</p>
 <p><em>Can I leave?&nbsp;</em>However, it was not possible, Mo Bai smiled gently and took the fan gracefully.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded in satisfaction, while munching the seeds, she opened the fan to fan herself, and at the same time signaled Mo Bai to do the same.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai finally replied, "No."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu raised her head with a smile on her face. "And here I was thinking that you're a bit weird today."</p>
 <p>"...What's weird?" Mo Bai looked at Gu Qingyu's eyes, with a gentle smile of his own.</p>
 <p>"Um, never mind." Gu Qingyu took the fan in Mo Bai's hand and wanted to get the seeds back too, but Mo Bai's palm closed.</p>
 <p>"What's wrong? Pass them back, I did go too far." Gu Qingyu reached out her hand.</p>
 <p>"No, Yu'er." Mo Bai curled his lips, "I want them now."</p>
 <p><em>Did I hear correctly?! He...wants them now?&nbsp;</em>She did not push any further, withdrew her hand, and continued munching her handful of seeds. The pair watched Qi Yichen and Qi Wan wrestle and roll on the ship’s deck.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"How long do you want to play?" Gu Qingyu called out to them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Never!" Qi Yichen roared.</p>
 <p>"You're wrong!" Qi Wan immediately strangled his neck. "Till one of us dies!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu grimaced and felt a little bored, so she got up and put away the small bench. Mo Bai also stood up, copying her. Gu Qingyu looked at Mo Bai, and then Qi Wan. "Mo Bai, walk with me."</p>
 <p>"Sure." Mo Bai smiled softly.</p>
 <p>They strolled on the deck. The oncoming sea breeze set them in good spirits but it was a little cold on the skin. Suddenly, the ship began to shake. Gu Qingyu was shocked, and immediately grabbed the side railing, while Mo Bai stretched out his hand and supported her.</p>
 <p>"What's going on?" Gu Qingyu frowned and raised her head, then she spotted a sailor in a black robe running over to them.</p>
 <p>"Ma'am, Sir, the ship is sinking due to some unknown problem, please get on the escape raft as soon as possible!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook her head. "What about the others?"</p>
 <p>"Leader Ye is looking into the cause. The others are also rushing to the escape raft, and we urge you two to do the same as soon as possible." The sailor bowed.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu asked anxiously, "Where is he? I'm going to find him."</p>
 <p>"The leader said that the madam should rest assured, he would join her soon." The sailor's humble attitude directly ignored Mo Bai’s whitening pupils as he remained behind Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, let's go." Mo Bai closed his eyes gently and opened it again, with its normal colour. "Remember just who Ye Jin is."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. <em>Yeah, Ye Jin is no mere mortal, with incredible powers. Despite knowing all this, I couldn't help but worry.</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They followed the sailor and soon came to the other side of the ship. Murong Zuoyu, Qi Yichen, Qi Wan and Xiao Qi were already there, waiting for them. The shaking had stopped a while ago, but they could feel the ship slowly sinking.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately turned back and looked at the sailor. "What about Ye Jin?"</p>
 <p>"The leader asks you to go first." The sailor lowered his head without saying anything more.</p>
 <p>"Boss, let's go first," Qi Wan frowned when he saw Gu Qingyu. "He must not want you to stay in danger, but if you stay, he would worry more. If you really must stay, I will stay in your stead!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu suddenly raised her head, seeing the resolve on Qi Wan's face. He was not joking at all. Xiao Qi also looked at Qi Wan. She was amazed, and finally, she slowly lowered her head.</p>
 <p>"Okay, let's go." Gu Qingyu glanced back at the ship worriedly, gritted her teeth in determination. Qi Wan was right, not only would she not be able to help by staying, but it might also drag Ye Jin down, but...</p>
 <p>"Can't you use your wings?" She asked Qi Wan anxiously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan laughed dryly. "Boss, do you think anyone can fly?"</p>

 <p>Ooooh, things are about to get interesting. I shall not build up the suspense too much. Chapter 107 and 108 will be released tomorrow, before the short hiatus.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>If you have not heard, I have to take a short break due to messy life arrangements at the moment. You can learn more in the announcement post. In short, ACA will be going on a short hiatus for the month of June, and resume daily releases in July. Thank you once again for your support.&nbsp;</p>
