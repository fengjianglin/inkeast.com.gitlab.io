 <p>"Okay, okay, I’m back, but I think I swallowed the Spirit Gem. What should I do?" Gu Qingyu said, looking at Qi Wan anxiously.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan looked surprised. "Boss, how did you swallow such a big gem?"</p>
 <p>"I don't know!" Gu Qingyu cried out, "I swallowed it! Now the key is how do I spit it out!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan stared at her sympathetically. "Good luck, Boss. Maybe when you will spit it out eventually again?"</p>
 <p>"Go away." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "I'm going to see Xiao Qi and the others, bring me there."</p>
 <p>"Alright!" Qi Wan kicked the door open excitedly. "Let's go!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu kept up with Qi Wan, and after twists and turns, they arrived at an area in the tower.</p>
 <p>"It's here." Qi Wan pointed to a row of rooms. "Everyone lives here."</p>
 <p>"Huh." Gu Qingyu picked a random door, held out her hand, and knocked gently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The door opened, and Xiao Qi's face greeted her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi!" Gu Qingyu immediately pounced on her, "How are you?"</p>
 <p>"I'm fine." Xiao Qi hugged her back, glanced at Qi Wan who stood at the side and stepped back to open up a path, "Come in."</p>
 <p>"Sure!" Gu Qingyu walked in and sat down at the table in the centre of the room. She was very relaxed and at home, there was only Xiao Qi and Qi Wan around. "Oh yeah, what happened when I fell asleep?"</p>
 <p>This was what she always wanted to ask, because since waking up, the atmosphere between Jia Qizhe and everyone seemed strange. Qi Wan didn't say anything, while Xiao Qi filled her in. "A group of people came out and took the Spider Queen away. They called Hero Jia ... Sire. Then, we came here."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "I see, we'll take a break and stay here for a few days. And, about what happened, I'm sorry for scaring you, Xiao Qi." She looked at Xiao Qi apologetically.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi held her hand and gave it a squeeze. "No, I actually want to thank you, Xiao Yu. If you hadn't stepped in, then I'm afraid I would have died in the hands of that giant demon."</p>
 <p>"Yeah!" Gu Qingyu also squeezed Xiao Qi's hand, "I really didn't expect that I was a tiger, and a White Tiger on top of that?" She nodded. "Well, I always thought I was just a cat, I didn’t expect the tiger to really show its power! "</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Xiao Qi also looked very emotional. "It's really surprising!" Qi Wan cringed a little, but he remained quiet.</p>
 <p>"This story tells us that we can't just look at the surface in all things, but in the long run~ maybe someone you offended today will kill you fiercely tomorrow!" She turned and gave Qi Wan a knowing look.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan felt a shiver go down his spine. "Boss, we can talk things out, I really didn't provoke you..." He suddenly remembered the moment Qi Yichen was pressed under her paw, and his face turned white instantly.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled and patted Xiao Qi on the shoulder. "I'm gonna head next door and talk to the others." Xiao Qi nodded. Gu Qingyu went out without forgetting to wink at Xiao Qi, and closed the door.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She walked out then knocked on the room on the left.</p>
 <p>"Who!" The door was opened impatiently, "Do you know that I am..."</p>
 <p>His sentence was suddenly held in stasis.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu saw a beautiful and elegant man with messy hair staring at her with wide eyes.</p>
 <p>"Qi Yichen?" Gu Qingyu narrowed her eyes suspiciously at the person in front of her. "What happened to you? Why is your hair a mess? And your clothes are in disarray!"</p>
 <p>His collar was open, revealing smooth skin and his sculpted collarbone. Gu Qingyu immediately covered her nose and looked into the room, and found that Mo Bai was walking towards her.</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry! I came at a bad time! Please, continue!" The words tumbled out of her mouth and she shut the door immediately. Inside the room, Qi Yichen covered his nose as blood trickled down his nose, the door had smacked him in the face. "Brother Zhu, you..."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu said excitedly, shouting from outside. "Carry on! Hurry!"</p>
 <p><em>Although I knew Qi Yichen is... but it's surprising to see Mo Bai. Oh well, I will miss Mo Bai, but it showed that Qi Yichen has moved forward, right?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just as her imagination was running wild, the door opened again, and Mo Bai's anxious face appeared. "Yu'er, listen to me..."</p>
 <p>"Hey, you don't have to." Gu Qingyu said with a smile, "It's really my fault, I shouldn't have..."</p>
 <p>"Yu'er!" Mo Bai cut her off with a shout. "I was changing his bandages."</p>
 <p>"Oh~ You were just changing his bandages~" Gu Qingyu nodded slowly. "It's ok, carry on, don't mind me!"</p>
 <p>"I'm already done." Mo Bai rubbed his eyebrows. "Yu'er, wipe away your nosebleed first."</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu was stunned, her hand rushed to her face and she wiped away the blood with her handkerchief.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the same time, Qi Yichen stepped out from the room. He had already sorted out his clothes and hair.</p>
 <p>"Alas, what a wet blanket." Gu Qingyu sighed quietly as she stared into Qi Yichen's eyes as if looking at a misguided teenager.</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen felt his lips twitch in annoyance, but he ignored her words.</p>
 <p>"Ah!" Gu Qingyu sighed again, "Well, I'm relieved to see you so lively."</p>
 <p>In fact, she was always worried for Qi Yichen. His injuries had not healed, and they were all caught in a dangerous battle, so Gu Qingyu was very worried about whether Qi Yichen's body could withstand it. According to what they just said, Mo Bai helped Qi Yichen change his bandages. Then it meant that Qi Yichen should be fine.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"By the way, do you know where the Spider Queen is held?" Gu Qingyu suddenly asked.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai shook his head. "Ye Jin was handling the matter. If Yu'er wants to know where she's kept, I can accompany you to find it."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu said and nodded. "Thank you... Mo Bai, wait a minute, I'll go and see Brother Murong."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu knocked on the door next to it. Murong Zuoyu still had a cold face. When he opened the door and saw Gu Qingyu, his stony face turned to one of surprise. "Brother Zhu?"</p>
 <p>"Huh!" Gu Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>Although she has shed her disguise, Qi Yichen and Murong Zuoyu still preferred to call her "Brother Zhu". Surprisingly, she did not have any qualms with it.</p>
 <p>"You are all right." Murong Zuoyu seemed relieved.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled: "Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you, Brother Murong. Without you, we would not have been able to capture the Spider Queen!"</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu shook his head. "It's hardly worth mentioning. I'm just glad that Brother Zhu is well."</p>
 <p>"I'm going to find the Spider Queen first to see if there are any clues." Gu Qingyu 's eyes sank, "I always feel that this attack was not so simple."</p>
 <p>"Agreed." Murong Zuoyu nodded. "Do you want me to come with you?"</p>
 <p>"No, it's ok, Brother Murong." Gu Qingyu smiled and she went out. "See you around!" Murong Zuoyu gave her a nod.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu and Mo Bai had just walked up the stairs when three people approached them. The one in the middle wore a black smiley face mask and was dressed in a black robe.</p>
 <p>"Uncle...Uncle Crow?" Gu Qingyu tilted her head and asked.</p>
 <p>Crow coughed and nodded unnaturally. "It's me." His voice was still hoarse.</p>
 <p>"It's good to see you, Uncle Crow." Gu Qingyu immediately greeted him respectfully. Laughter escaped from the two people behind Crow. They did not wear masks, but only wore black clothes, so their faces were easily seen. They were two men, probably in their thirties.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What's so funny?" Crow glanced back at the two of them with dissatisfaction. The two immediately closed their mouths, but it was not hard to see that they were still fighting a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Uncle Crow, where are you guys off to?" Gu Qingyu looked at Crow curiously.</p>
 <p>"I was waiting for you, for your orders, as instructed by our leader." Crow bowed his head slightly.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "Thank you. Your leader said that I can do whatever I want. Can you take me to wherever I want?" <em>Well, let me set things up.</em></p>
 <p>"Uh... yes." Crow nodded, even though he was unsure why Gu Qingyu would ask such a question.</p>
 <p>"Well, I want to see the Spider Queen" Gu Qingyu smiled.</p>
 <p>Crow seemed hesitant. "Miss Gu, this..."</p>
 <p>"But you said I can go wherever I want, and you'll bring me there." Gu Qingyu raised her eyebrows.</p>
 <p>Crow finally relented. "Miss Gu, please come with me."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu followed Crow, Mo Bai fell in step behind her. But Crow stopped and said to Mo Bai. "Sir, please stay."</p>
 <p>"Can't I go?" Mo Bai's smile was polite, but Crow clearly felt a sense of pressure from the person in front of him.</p>
 <p>Crow replied calmly. "Only Miss Gu has the leader's permission to go as she pleases. Please, you will have to stay here, Mister Mo."</p>
 <p>"Forget it, Mo Bai," Gu Qingyu tugged on his sleeve. "I'll go alone, thank you."</p>
 <p>Mo Bai agreed with a defeated nod. "Yu'er, be careful."</p>
 <p>She assured him. "It's alright, they're all Jia Qizhe's men anyway..."</p>
 <p>"Ye is incredibly honoured to have Miss Gu's deep trust in us and our leader." Crow bowed again. The leader did tell them to get in the way of "that guy called Mo" as much as they can.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shrugged. "Let's go."</p>
 <p>Mo Bai looked away and kept quiet.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu followed Crow and the two other people up the stairs.</p>
 <p>Along the way, Gu Qingyu watched Crow curiously.</p>
 <p>"Ahem, may I ask Miss Gu, what's the matter?" Crow cleared his throat awkwardly.</p>
 <p>"Uncle Crow, your mask is so beautiful!" Gu Qingyu sighed in admiration.</p>
 <p>"Uh..."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Actually, you look better when you take off the mask!" Gu Qingyu said sincerely, but immediately realised she might have gone out of line. <em>People who wear masks in novels or TV series usually have a sad backstory. Like a huge scar, some form of disfigurement? A la, the Phantom?</em></p>
 <p>She changed her mind from the sudden swell of guilt. "Of course, if Uncle Crow is used to wearing a mask, you don't need to take it off."</p>
 <p>"I don't mind..." Crow cleared his throat yet again. "It's just that the leader told me that I can't take off my mask."</p>
