 <p><strong>Chapter 18: Oh my! What a coincidence, my dear 'elder sister'!</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A cold sweat broke out on her forehead.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Her heart froze instantly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>D-did she recognize me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai took Gu Qingyu's trembling hand in his and held it tight. “</span><i><span style>Calm down. She doesn’t seem to have recognized you,</span></i><span style>” he whispered into her ear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt as if a stone had been lifted off her chest when she heard his reassuring voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For some reason, Gu Qingyu trusted Mo Bai more than anyone she'd ever trusted in her life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wasn't afraid of the second young lady per se, but she was afraid of the young lady going back reporting on her to the family. The Gu Manor held great influence and power in this country, especially so in the Imperial City. Gu Qingyu understood that there would be great trouble if her father got wind of it that she was currently in the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman turned her eyes back forward and walked past Gu Qingyu to the counter. She exchanged a few words with the owner of the pharmacy, then turned, looked at Gu Qingyu again, and headed straight towards her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good day, young masters.” The young woman greeted the two of them with a soft and gentle voice, smooth like water, as she did a slight curtsy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu composed herself and looked at the young woman with a smile. “What may I do for you, miss?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I can’t lose momentum here!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman returned Gu Qingyu’s smile. “I heard just now from the owner that you bought the last batch of the 『Seven Coloured Grass』. Because, little I, am in an urgent need of the herb, I’m willing to pay five times the price you paid for that bundle. What do you say, young masters?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hoh~ She could almost be nominated for Best Actress in the Academy Awards.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu curled her lips. “Miss, don’t tell me you believe money can buy you anything?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman looked confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu didn’t give her a chance to reply as she continued flatly, “You may use money to buy herbs, but don’t think that you can do the same with others’ lives. All life is precious, so we shouldn’t trample on it so easily. Don’t you think so too, miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And with that said, Gu Qingyu took Mo Bai’s hand and they left the pharmacy, leaving behind a bewildered young woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why does his voice sound so familiar...” mumbled the young woman to herself. “Who could he be...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jia Qizhe turned around to say something to Gu Qingyu, she and Mo Bai were already gone. He frowned and quickly glanced around, but they were nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Later as he went in search of them, he spotted the two at the entrance of a building. They were just leaving a store hand in hand, and Gu Qingyu was even smiling with relief at Mo Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe walked up to them with a frowning face. “What were you two doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you remember that girl who tried to assassinate me? We just met her inside this pharmacy.” Gu Qingyu knitted her brows, she didn't bother hiding her disgust. “It was good that Mo Bai bought the last of the Seven Colored Grass before she could. Otherwise, it might’ve been used for another one of her terrible acts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For now, I think it’s best for you to change your name,” said Qi Yichen, who just had come, with his hand rubbing against his chin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ooh? Excellent idea! But what should I be called?” Gu Qingyu’s eyes held a wild glint of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Blacky?” Qi Yichen seemed to be in deep thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of name is that!” Jia Qizhe exclaimed, raising one eyebrow at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded noncommittally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe continued, “In my opinion, I believe ‘Whitey’ suits her more!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfft——” Gu Qingyu laughed. “Your naming senses are exceeding one another!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You flatter us.” Jia Qizhe curled his lips. “If you’re not satisfied with the names we came up with, why not think of one yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Bai, what do you think suits me?” There was a different sort of ‘sincere affection’ in her tone when she asked Mo Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm... what do you think of changing your family name to ‘Zhu’ for the time being?” suggested Mo Bai tentatively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, very well!” She was so happy with his suggestion that she clapped her hands. “What about the name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although the letter ‘Zhu’ means ‘bamboo’, a symbol of noble character, it is also very ordinary. While ‘Fan’ means ‘mortal’, is also earthly and common. I suppose you wouldn’t mind being called Zhu Fan?” A faint smile appeared on his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded her head approvingly. “Sounds great! From now on, I’ll temporarily be known as Zhu Fan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhu Fan, we’re leaving,” said Jia Qizhe tonelessly, and went on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oi, Oi!” She hastened her pace and grinned mischievously. “Brother Jia, wait for me~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shut up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>And so, the sound of happy chatter and laughter followed as Gu Qingyu's party advanced towards the palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um, how do you suppose we get in...” asked Xiao Qi at last, after being invisible and neglected for a long while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go and survey the area for possible routes. We’ll operate at night.” Jia Qizhe turned gracefully around.</span><span style> “Go, let’s find an inn to stay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, okay...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu frowned. She felt something from the pit of her stomach calling to her. Feline instinct warned her that someone was following them. Someone... very powerful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they found an inn close to the palace, the first thing Gu Qingyu did after entering was to order food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dig in, dig in! Only with a full belly will we have enough stamina to move!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others didn’t deny she was right this time, so each man sat down and began to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After the ‘excellent’ meal, Jia Qizhe wiped the corners of his mouth delicately and stood up. “I’ll take my leave now. If you can, try to get some rest and prepare for our mission tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I shall go with you!” Gu Qingyu rose from her seat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?” He raised his eyebrow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, me.” Gu Qingyu stood there, placing her hands on her hips, and yelled like a fishwife, “What kind of attitude is that? Do you have something against me? Hmpf! Don’t forget that I’m a c——...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She abruptly stopped in mid-sentence. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What am I trying to say? That I’m a cat spirit!? Oh my god, I almost blew my cover! I can’t let Qi Yichen and Mo Bai know, otherwise they might start treating me like a monster!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t forget you are a what?” asked Jia Qizhe in a playful tone. He had long predicted it would turn out like this, and what she was going to say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The frown on her face seemed to say, ‘I am thinking seriously. Disturb me and you’re dead’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh... I am the cute, dexterous, lively, witty, good-natured, intelligent and brave... Zhu Fan!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, sure, you’re right. Let’s go then.” He waved his hand and gestured for her to follow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s okay with this kind of... excuse?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aiyo~ Gu Qingyu, how clever of me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bye bye!” She waved her hand at the other three. “We’ll be back very soon~!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Qi Yichen stuffed food in his mouth as he waved his other hand, “Okokok. Go, hurry up and leave!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hurry up and leave...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Shouldn’t you be blessing us and telling us to come back safely?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m disappointed in you, Qi Yichen...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yu, stay safe and come back soon, okay?” Xiao Qi smiled and waved back at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai didn’t say anything and just smiled at her. He pointed at her little pouch.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh, it’s a Hundred Whirling Leaf. He must be meaning for me to use it if something happens.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sigh~... Still, Mo Bai and Xiao Qi are the best to me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu smiled back then turned around to the door. Of course, Jia Qizhe was nowhere to be seen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She flew immediately out of the inn and down the street. She ran as fast as she could until she finally caught up with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mere thought of being able to catch up to Jia Qizhe was very gratifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jia Qizhe looked at Gu Qingyu’s bright and pleased face, he let out a sigh ‘reluctantly’, “</span><i><span style>Sigh~</span></i><span style> I hate to break it down to you, but I hope you realise that you can’t match me in speed.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? What do you mean?” Gu Qingyu’s smiled vanished like the sun behind a cloud.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If it wasn’t me waiting, how could you possibly catch up to me?"&nbsp;His eyes were full of teasing mockery.&nbsp; "But aren’t you too slow? I imagined you to be somewhat faster.”</span></p>
