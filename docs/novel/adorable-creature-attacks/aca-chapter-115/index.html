<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>Tsing Yi's body stiffened as she lowered her head in shock. Her body was punctured by multiple ribbons as her own blood dyed her clothes crimson. Pain tore through her, she opened her mouth to let out a scream, but no sound came out. He did not let her go easy, even her death had to be painful. Her eyes widened at that realisation as her grip on her dagger loosened and she slumped to the ground. The man in dark green had avoided her vitals, so Tsing Yi was still alive. In fact, she was kept alive so that she could suffer in agony. <em>This man, Qi Wan, was even more ruthless and unforgiving than Mo Bai. Just who is he?</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu also slowly fell to the ground and into Mo Bai's arms. Mo Bai immediately knelt down, let Gu Qingyu lie on his knees, and looked at the person in his arms with shock and panic. "Yu'er...Yu'er!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu could only hear Mo Bai, she raised her head slightly and looked at him as she managed to squeeze out a faint smile. "Mo Bai, I'm sorry....I haven't really been able to help you."</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, stop talking, I'll heal you!" Mo Bai's hands glowed with stars, but Qi Wan grabbed his hand and stopped him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai raised his head and met Qi Wan's angry and cold eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Mo Bai, listen to me," Gu Qingyu coughed. "Don't... continue anymore... Actually I have... restored my memory... I'm sorry... I lied to you... please...…"</p>
 <p>Her words were suddenly stuck in her throat.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er!" Mo Bai's pupil shrank suddenly. "No!"</p>
 <p>Then, a pair of hands shoved him to the side as Qi Wan pulled Gu Qingyu into his arms. Icy rage was all that was on his face. "This is what you wanted? Your insanity is what killed her."</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry... I'm sorry..." Mo Bai looked at Gu Qingyu in Qi Wan's arms, "Yu'er..."</p>
 <p>"Do you know? If I didn't care about her feelings, I would have destroyed this city and dragged her out of here! Did you know? You're the one that she kept fussing over even after her memories came back. She was worried about you! But what did you give her? What can you give her?" A ribbon flew out from Qi Wan and wrapped Tsing Yi into a bundle. He leapt up and left.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai sat on the ground in a complete daze. "Yu'er... how could this be..."</p>
 <p><em>I still ended up hurting you.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Wan soared through the air with Gu Qingyu in his arms. And with a shake, the ribbon wrapped around Tsing Yi loosened and she plummeted to the ground. A man in black caught her right before impact. The man in black watched Qi Wan go away, then bowed his head respectfully before he turned to face Tsing Yi.</p>
 <p>"You... who are you..." It took all of her strength to squeeze out her question.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Your people call me Kuro, I work for Qi Wan." Kuro smiled at her slightly, and his beautiful face shone like a demon in the moonlight, "His orders were to treat you well. Let's go."</p>
 <p>The fear in Tsing Yi's eyes was magnified infinitely.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Wan landed on a hill. Someone immediately came up and knelt before him. "Master! Tsing Yi has arrived!"</p>
 <p>"Good." The warmth in his eyes were replaced by infinite coldness. He strode into the nearby valley with the now-unconscious Gu Qingyu in his arms. <em>Ye Jin, Mo Bai. Since either of you can't protect her, then don't blame me for being rude.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Qi Wan came to a cottage and then gently his fingers along the edge of the bed, the bed flipped up and revealed a tunnel. He walked down the tunnel and into a luxurious palace. He went straight to the bed and gently set her down onto the sheets. The sheets were slightly cold.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A man walked in immediately and bowed his head obediently. "Master!"</p>
 <p>"Yu, heal her." Qi Wan glanced at him.</p>
 <p>Without any hesitation, Yu nodded. "Yes!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan stepped back and Yu stepped forward. Yu wrapped his hand around the dagger in her chest, and with a bit of force, he pulled it out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Blood spewed from her wound. Qi Wan just frowned, but his eyes remained on Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yu stretched out his hand, white mist swirled and gathered in his palm. Slowly and gently, he pressed down on the gaping wound and stopped the bleeding. Then, Yu chanted with a magnetic baritone. His voice echoed through the room and added a sense of sombre hollowness. "May my years bring your healing, may my health restore your peace. May my offering of life bring about your awakening, may my mortal flesh be exchanged for your immortal eternity."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her body started to glow with a faint light, then the light grew bigger and bigger until it blinded everything.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Soon, the light dissipated.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The young and beautiful Yu is no longer there, replaced by a mere husk of bones. Meanwhile, Gu Qingyu was peacefully asleep. Her breathing had smoothened out, it was clear that she was out of the woods. Someone immediately stepped forward and removed the skeleton. Qi Wan walked over, sat down at the edge of her bed and watched her intently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No one can hurt you now, Boss." His fingertips brushed against the hollow of her cheeks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's brow gently furrowed, then smoothened as her eyes opened with a soft flutter.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You're awake?" Within seconds, a smile spread across Qi Wan's face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah," Gu Qingyu rubbed her head, her mind felt fuzzy. It took her a long time to react. The last thing she remembered was Tsing Yi's dagger going through her. "Where...are we? Am I dead?"</p>
 <p>"I'm right here, how could you be dead?" Qi Wan gave a cheeky grin. "How do you feel? Are you touched? Would you like to repay me? You can just put a ring on it."</p>
 <p>"Go away. If you want a ring, you missed your chance a few more thousand years." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes.</p>
 <p>"So I had a chance a few thousand years ago?" Qi Wan's eyes lit up.</p>
 <p>"Yeah, yeah." Gu Qingyu jumped out of bed. It didn't hurt at all, even though she was stabbed just moments ago. "Qi Wan, what did you do?"</p>
 <p>"It's a secret." Qi Wan leaned into her and said with a low whisper, "But I can tell you if you marry me~"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Then forget it, I rather not know." Gu Qingyu pouted as she smacked his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was not annoyed. "Ahahaha! Boss, come with me for a walk~"</p>
 <p>"Well, okay." Gu Qingyu stood up, but her legs gave out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan immediately held her up. "Boss, you've gotten old! Slow down, I'll support you." It should be a sequela. Whatever healing method he used, it did not recover her lost strength.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu realised that she would have difficulty walking on her own, so she nodded. "Let's go." Qi Wan carefully supported Gu Qingyu and the pair left the palace and walked up a path. Soon, the path opened up to the surrounding scenery.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The night sky stretched on, but light was slowly breaking through the darkness at the edge of the horizon. In that moment, both the moon and the sun shared the sky. It was daybreak. Dewdrops were forming on leaves, tiny veins along the leaves were visible. Birds were chirping in the distance as they welcomed a new day. Gu Qingyu looked at the beauty of these natures in a trance. The cold wind of the ending winter swept towards her and carried the fragrance of the beginning of spring with it. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan took off his most outer robe and draped it over her shoulders. "Do you like it?"</p>
 <p>"This is the place you mentioned when we were back at Ye?" Gu Qingyu said in amazement, "It's so beautiful!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah, it's beautiful." Qi Wan narrowed his eyes and smiled. In the faint light, his face looked clean and pure. "It's been such a long time since I have been here. Now, finally someone can watch it with me."</p>
 <p>That sounded like a relieved exclamation, but Gu Qingyu heard the disappointment in his excitement. She didn't say anything and focused on the moment. She heard the sound of the first dewdrop sliding off a leaf. &nbsp;She felt the warmth of the sun slowly passing through the clouds, the coolness of the wind blowing gently on her face, and the person around her that was sharing this moment with her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Do you know?" Qi Wan suddenly said, "I can feel everything from you. I can even hear your heartbeat. I never thought that I would find someone in this world that I want to spend the rest of my entire life with."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu raised her head. "Well, I can feel yours too. "</p>
 <p>This bond between them has gone past soulmates, or even twin flames. Neither of them could describe this, but they could always sense each other.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Then, Gu Qingyu suddenly remembered Ye Jin. <em>Where is he now? Is he ok? The last time we met, he got hurt. Did he get better? Or did it get worse? &nbsp;Is he still looking for me? Does he still want to see me?&nbsp;</em>His charming face appeared in her mind.</p>
 <p>"What are you thinking about?" Qi Wan looked at Gu Qingyu with a smile, but he knew deep down who was on her mind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu hesitated, looked at Qi Wan again, and finally shook her head. "It's fine."</p>
 <p><em>I don't want to destroy this atmosphere. I don't want to destroy Qi Wan's happy mood.</em></p>
 <p>"Right, we should get going, get some breakfast in our system. I can make a full spread you know? The size of a buffet table!" Qi Wan pointed and emphasised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay, I know delicacies of the world. What do you think I've been eating this whole time? &nbsp;I've eaten pretty much everything except for poison." Gu Qingyu began to walk back to the palace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan opened his mouth, but paused right before he said anything. In the end, he couldn't resist and asked, "What about feces?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was speechless. Only Qi Wan would think like this.</p>
 <p>She rolled her eyes. "Nope, I haven't tried it. That one's for you to try."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan chuckled as he gently supported her and led the way.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu suddenly remembered Mo Bai but shook her head gently. She could use a break, a breather to clear her mind before she dealt with what remained.</p>
