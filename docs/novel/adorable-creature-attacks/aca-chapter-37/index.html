 <p>Soon, they arrived at a house. “Be careful.” Jia Qizhe suddenly whispered quietly in her ear, “I have a bad feeling about this.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. “I will be careful, you too.”</p>
 <p>After dinner, everyone returned to their rooms.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Should I talk to Murong Zuoyu?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was conflicted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Really, wasn’t it just an apology?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>She made up her mind and bravely knocked on Murong Zuoyu’s door. The door was open. Murong Zuoyu was still dressed in his purple robes, it seemed that he was not turning in for the night yet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Murong…” Gu Qingyu had her signature wide smile.</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu coldly looked at her, with a tinge of shock. “Is there something?”</p>
 <p>“Nothing actually…” To avoid suspicion from the others, Gu Qingyu stepped into Murong Zuoyu’s room. “I just want to have a heart-to-heart talk with you!”</p>
 <p>“Xiao Qi is next door.” Murong Zuoyu had a blank face, he clearly did not know what was going on.</p>
 <p>“I know, I know,” Gu Qingyu nodded. “Actually, I want to talk to you.”</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu pointed to a chair in the room, Gu Qingyu sat down. “Brother Murong, you really don’t want to ask why I had beef with the Second Young Miss?”</p>
 <p>“I can guess why.” Murong Zuoyu replied honestly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So he did not want to ask because he already knew?</em></p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu continued, “I know you have your reasons for not telling me so what’s there for me to ask?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu felt extremely guilty about this. “I was wrong! Brother Murong, actually I…”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Watch out!” At that moment, Murong Zuoyu suddenly dragged Gu Qingyu away and striked out with his sword. Gu Qingyu staggered and straightened herself, she realised that the window had been broken. Multiple black-clothed men stood outside.</p>
 <p>“What are they doing here?” Gu Qingyu looked at Murong Zuoyu, puzzled. “Are they here to kill me?”</p>
 <p>“Very likely.” Murong Zuoyu held his sword in his right hand, and ran his left index finger along the blade of his sword. Wherever his finger touched, the blade emitted a purple light.</p>
 <p>“Wow, that’s so cool,” Gu Qingyu exclaimed. Murong Zuoyu jumped out and started to fight off the assassins.</p>
 <p>“Watch out!” Suddenly, a voice rang out and a white shadow dashed in front of Gu Qingyu. His fan swirled rapidly and blocked the incoming darts. “I’ve already said to watch out, Brother Zhu.”</p>
 <p>“Qi Yichen!” Gu Qingyu looked at him, then glanced outside, Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai had joined the battle too.</p>
 <p>“Yeap, we’re all here to protect you, Boss!’ Qi Wan walked in with a smile. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Actually, Qi Wan, what’s your weapon? I’ve never actually seen it...” Gu Qingyu scratched her head.</p>
 <p>“Eh, boss, you’re interested? Then, I’ll show you!” Qi Wan grinned and stretched out his hand. A dark green ribbon flew out from his hand, the ribbon wrapped around an assassin that came in and threw him out of the window.</p>
 <p>“Wow...So violent.” Gu Qingyu commented, then saw another group of assassins enter the room. “Go, Qi Wan!”</p>
 <p>“Yes, my lord!” More ribbons flew out from Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>“Qi Yichen, what can your fan do except defend?” Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Yichen curiously.</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen smiled. “Kill.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Killing people with a paper fan? Even though I read it in books before, it still sounds so miraculous...</em></p>
 <p>“What, you don’t believe it?” Qi Yichen’s fan suddenly flew out and hit a man, the fan lightly brushed against the man’s neck, then flew back to Qi Yichen’s hand. The man was stunned for a moment, then blood spewed out of his neck. Qi Yichen’s paper fan had somehow turned into steel as a faint white light emitted from the fan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Yichen closed the fan in his hands and rested his chin against it. “In comparison… Brother Zhu, you’re a bit weak.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How could I forget that this is a magical world! How can I forget this scholar’s schemes and aggressiveness!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes haughtily. “I am handsome and kind, smart and cool, beautiful and cute. If I can fight too, then what’s left for all of you guys to do?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I don’t know what you’re saying but it sounds like it makes sense!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>But Qi Wan understood her and burst out in laughter. An assassin tried to make use of his distraction and lunged towards Qi Wan. Gu Qingyu’s shot an arrow with her crossbow sleeve, it pierced the assassin’s neck, then continued its path through the air and hit another assassin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She said with wrinkles around her eyes, “Be careful, Qi Wan!”</p>
 <p>“Y-Y-Yes!” Qi Wan replied immediately with a shout. He then murmured softly under his breath, “What kind of attack power is that…”</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen broke into a cold sweat as well, he could feel the stickiness along his back. “Brother Zhu…”</p>
 <p>“Yeah.” Gu Qingyu replied absentmindedly as she scrutinised the crossbow sleeve, “Looks like there’s still not enough power, even though I’ve made so many modifications…”</p>
 <p>“...Brother Zhu, we can talk this out…”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>More and more black assassins appeared, the situation became similar to the time they were stuck halfway up the mountain on their journey to find Qi Yichen’s master.</p>
 <p>“Let me try something, Qi Wan.” Just as Gu Qingyu said those words, Qi Wan appeared by her side. He was panting slightly and seemed tired.The bodies of the black assassins was enough to fill up a room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hmm…” Gu Qingyu closed her eyes and the air around her turned white. “Absolute Freeze!” A layer of ice spread out beneath her feet and froze the incoming assassins.</p>
 <p>“Hey, I’m pretty good!” Gu Qingyu seemed pleased.</p>
 <p>“Impressive!” Qi Wan exclaimed. “This is not just good… Actually, where did you learn this, boss?”</p>
 <p>“The Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny taught me.” Gu Qingyu nodded. The Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny granted magical powers so that explained where her magic comes from without revealing Yan Zun’s existence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Impressive.” Qi Yichen commented wistfully.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi tip-toed into the room from the doorway, “This is terrifying...”</p>
 <p>“But sadly, using spells does take quite a bit of my stamina,” Gu Qingyu fired more arrows from her crossbow sleeve and brought down the incoming wave of assassins.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She yelled at Jia Qizhe, Murong Zuoyu, and Mo Bai, all of whom were still outside, “There’s too many of them, let’s make a run for it!” She waved and Xiao Qi jogged to her side.</p>
 <p>“You all go first, we’ll stall for a while.” Jia Qizhe replied with a steady voice as he continued to fight.</p>
 <p>“I need to protect the villagers here, go.” Indeed, he was a Duke that loved his people. Murong Zuoyu had a steady tone as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Brother Zhu, protect yourself well.” Mo Bai tossed her a leaf when he had a moment to spare.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Alright!’ Gu Qingyu replied, then said to Qi Yichen, “Since their target is me, then we’ll split up, you bring Xiao Qi, I’ll be with Qi Wan.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Why?” Qi Yichen frowned but nodded reluctantly, “Fine! Go out from here and head straight north, we’ll meet at the valley there!”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and ran out with Qi Wan. Those assassins wanted to pursue them but were blocked by the others, only a few caught up. That night was destined to be full of disturbance. &nbsp;Qi Wan was the only one around her. Only then did Gu Qingyu feel relaxed enough and turned into her cat demon form as they sprinted into the night.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan complained, “I’m tired, I hate running!”</p>
 <p>“Exercise is good for your health!” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes, despite being exhausted too. Qi Wan suddenly spread his wings, grabbed Gu Qingyu in his arms and took to the skies. The assassins were stunned for a moment, then took flight as well. Gu Qingyu used her crossbow sleeve and shot down the assassins behind her one by one.</p>
 <p>“Boss, be careful…” Qi Wan looked scared. “Don’t hit me...Stay calm…”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry, trust me.” Gu Qingyu let loose another arrow.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Only one assassin left, Gu Qingyu’s lips curled and released the last arrow. The assassin was hit but before he went down, he threw a dart with all his might. The dart multiplied into hundreds and flew towards them. Qi Wan hugged Gu Qingyu and held her against him as he avoided the darts as much as possible. However, he still took a few hits along his wings and his back. His entire body stiffened and they plummeted to the ground.</p>
 <p>“Qi Wan!” Mid-fall, Gu Qingyu called out to him, “Qi Wan, what’s wrong?”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan smiled, blood bubbled out from his lips. Just before they crashed into a huge rock, the ribbon in his sleeve flew out and hooked itself onto a tree. He grabbed Gu Qingyu by the waist with one arm. They finally stopped falling and were suspended in the air. Beneath them was a steep cliff, the faint trickling of water echoed from below.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Qi Wan? Are you alright?” Gu Qingyu asked anxiously, his face had turned ashen white. Qi Wan shook his head and bit down hard on his teeth.The ribbon curled and they zipped up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They finally made it back on flat ground. Gu Qingyu caught Qi Wan as he collapsed, “Hang in there, I see a cave just up ahead.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded, it took him great effort to hold onto Gu Qingyu as they walked into the cave. Inside, Gu Qingyu slowly let Qi Wan lay down on the ground. She then gathered a bit of firewood, placed her hands on it and fire crackled to life. This was a spell Yan Zun taught her. With the light, Gu Qingyu could finally examine Qi Wan. He was still bleeding! Gu Qingyu took off her own robes and pressed it against his wounds to try and stop the bleeding.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What’s next?! That’s right! Mo Bai’s medicine!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took the small leaf and gently placed it in Qi Wan’s mouth. Qi Wan’s face was still pale but colour was slowly returning to his face. Gu Qingyu then fed him some water. Qi Wan gently coughed a few times and slowly opened his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He checked his surroundings, then a sigh of relief escaped his mouth. “I was so scared! I thought I went back!”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu obviously knew what he meant by ‘going back’.</p>
 <p>“Is it not good to go back?” Gu Qingyu retorted as she sat down across him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“I have not gotten your phone number yet!” Qi Wan pouted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu laughed incredulously, &nbsp;“Why are you so determined?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Yes, he lost so much blood but he still held me so tightly and refused to let go. He used all of his strength, just to help me survive. Is it really simply because he just wanted to go back?</em></p>
 <p>Qi Wan shrugged. “Yes, you can say so.”</p>
 <p>“Is it because of someone you can’t leave behind?” Gu Qingyu stared into the warm fire before them.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan smiled, shook his head, then nodded. “Yes, and no.”</p>
 <p>This vague answer took Gu Qingyu by surprise, but she laughed too. <em>Indeed, yes and no</em>.</p>
