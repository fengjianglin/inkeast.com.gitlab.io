 <p>Gu Qingyu closed her eyes slightly. When she opened them again, she was already pulled into someone's arms. There was a soothing, familiar scent that calmed her whenever it showed up. She could not say what the scent was, but she knew who it represented.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It was Ye Jin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She raised her head and saw Ye Jin in his striking blue robe. His left hand was wrapped around her, and his right hand gripped the dagger and stopped it.</p>
 <p><em>Pitter-patter, Pitter-patter.</em> Blood dribbled from his hand, and dripped to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Big Brother Ye Jin..." Ye Ya immediately let go and the dagger dropped to the floor with a clatter.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe, why are you here?" Gu Qingyu said, startled. She stroked his right hand then took out her handkerchief and wrapped it around his palm, trying to stop the blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Are you not happy to see me, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin smirked, his smile was charming as always.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu resisted the blood rushing to her nose. "Xiao Zhezhe, not now!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Is that so? Then we'll talk about it once we get back." Ye Jin stroked her hair with his left hand, his fingers weaved through her tresses as he watched her tie the handkerchief with dreamy eyes. Suddenly, he turned his eyes and looked at Ye Ya. His eyes were filled with coldness and bloodthirst. His sleeve flicked through the air, and a sudden gust swept towards Ye Ya.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She collapsed onto her knees, as blood spat out from her lips. "Big Brother...Ye Jin..."</p>
 <p>This blow has made his anger clear, yet he suddenly turned back and looked softly at Gu Qingyu. "Xiao Yu'er, let's go."</p>
 <p>"Huh? Where's Nightingale?" Gu Qingyu knew that Nightingale had slipped away. But she glanced about deliberately, in order to aggravate Ye Ya more.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Sure enough, after hearing this, Ye Ya suddenly raised her head. "What do you say? That...bitch!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu sighed. "Ah! Karma!"</p>
 <p>Ye Ya's face had turned red with rage, but she could not articulate it due to her wounds. "She... she..."</p>
 <p>"Let's go, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin smiled and gathered her into his arms.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"But... Your hand..." Her worry caused her to squirm and struggle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't move, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin had a teasing look in his eyes. "Or my hand would hurt."</p>
 <p>She stopped the second he said that. "Then... put me down... I can walk on my own..." Her face turned pink.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>But he kept walking. "Xiao Yu'er, how can I let you down?"</p>
 <p>"...Meanie." Gu Qingyu lowered her head and covered her burning face with her hands. He let out a full-bellied laugh at the sight of her embarrassment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as they stepped out, a few people hurried to the scene and knelt down when they saw Ye Jin. "King! Queen!"</p>
 <p>"Yes, Crow, I'll leave this matter to you. Find Nightingale before the sun sets." Ye Jin's footsteps did not stop, and he continued with large strides.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Crow's voice came.</p>
 <p>Halfway through, Gu Qingyu saw Qi Wan rush over, and when he saw Gu Qingyu, Qi Wan clearly lit up. "Boss! Are you okay?!"</p>
 <p>Seeing Gu Qingyu lying in Ye Jin's arms, the worry hidden in his brows grew heavier.</p>
 <p>"I'm okay." Gu Qingyu gave a comforting smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"That's good." Qi Wan breathed a sigh of relief. &nbsp;"Xiao Qi came to find me, she's now in my room."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Eh?" Gu Qingyu raised her head in surprise.</p>
 <p>"She told me that you are in danger, I have to save you... and she said it was all her fault. Boss, what's going on?" Qi Wan blinked doubtfully.</p>
 <p>"Did she go get you too?" Gu Qingyu looked up at Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>"No. If anything happens to Divine Tune, my Ghost Howl will definitely sense it." Ye Jin's expression seemed calm. He watched Gu Qingyu quietly, not even willing to miss a moment without her in his eyes. In his eyes, she understood that no matter what happened, he would go into the abyss with her, and even as the world around them turned into ash, he would be with her until the bitter end. He's not anxious, because he firmly believes that he would protect her, no matter what happens.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe, can you put me down? I want to see her." Gu Qingyu licked her lips weakly. "...Please?"</p>
 <p>Ye Jin gently released her immediately. "I'll go with you."</p>
 <p>"Yep!" Gu Qingyu nodded and looked at Qi Wan. "Let's go."</p>
 <p>"...Okay." Qi Wan pulled his lips into a strained smile. <em>At least you remember me, don't you?</em></p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><strong>Meanwhile</strong></p>
 <p>In the shadows, a white robe was shrouded by a dark energy. His hands were wrapped around Nightingale's neck, her face was contorted in pain. Her hands clawed at the vice-like grip around her neck, but his fingers would not budge.</p>
 <p>"You should have expected this the moment you decided to hurt her." A bloodthirsty smile split across the man's face, a stark contrast from his usual gentle demeanor. His fingers tightened and Nightingale's pupils grew wide. Her arms dropped to her side and the light in her eyes went out. All who hurt her shall die in agony.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stopped before Qi Wan's room, her raised hand stopped in mid-air. She cast a furtive glance at the person next to her. Qi Wan nodded slightly at her, and she opened the door with a light push.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi was seated at the table in the center of the room. She shot up from her seat the moment she saw Gu Qingyu. "Xiao Yu...I... I'm sorry."</p>
 <p>"Why are you apologising?" Gu Qingyu closed the door, walked over, and gently wrapped her arms around Xiao Qi. "You saved me. I should be thanking you, silly girl."</p>
 <p>"No! Xiao Yu, that's not what happened..." Xiao Qi sighed, "I betrayed you. It's my fault."</p>
 <p>"You didn't." Gu Qingyu's words were resolute. "Didn't you come to get Qi Wan to rescue me?"</p>
 <p>"You... Xiao Yu, I was waiting for you here to apologise. " She lowered her head. "I'm sorry. Xiao Yu, you are such a kind person... I know you love each and every one of us, and you believe in us from the bottom of your heart, even the people who plotted against you. I know that I'm the only one you trusted completely, and yet I betrayed that trust. I nearly killed you."</p>
 <p>"It doesn't matter." The knot between Gu Qingyu's brows loosened. "Can you continue to stay by my side?" It was obvious to her that Xiao Qi did not just stay for apologies, she was going to bid her farewell.</p>
 <p>"Can I... can I stay?" Xiao Qi looked up suddenly.</p>
 <p>"Of course." Gu Qingyu smiled brightly. "Welcome to the team."</p>
 <p>She did not just let Xiao Qi stay, she welcomed her to the team. That meant that everything in the past will cease to exist and she will have a new beginning with her.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi beamed at her, and she raised her hand to wipe the tears from the corner of her eyes. "...Yep!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took Xiao Qi's hand into her own and walked out of the door. Ye Jin and Qi Wan were standing at the door. When they saw them, they didn't say anything. With their expertise in magic, the two men must have heard their conversation.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan's face was slightly gloomy, he looked down and seemed to be deep in thought.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan?" Gu Qingyu said softly, Qi Wan ignored it.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu pouted and gave his shoulders a hard smack. "Qi Wan!"</p>
 <p>"Ah!" Qi Wan jumped suddenly, then patted his chest in shock, "You spooked me, Boss, you could have just called me..."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes, she opened her mouth to speak but Qi Wan continued.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I'm sorry, Boss." Qi Wan looked at her with eyes full of guilt. "It's all my fault. If I didn't butt heads with Qi Yichen, you wouldn't..." He bit his lip tightly as he blamed himself.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi glanced at Qi Wan, and quickly lowered her head. There seemed to be something crashing in her eyes, a dam had broken.</p>
 <p>"Okay, I'm fine. Everything worked out, right?" Gu Qingyu patted his shoulder. "You ..."</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er" Ye Jin jumped into the conversation with a slight whimper.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That instantly reminded her of the wound on Ye Jin's hand and she quickly dragged him away. "Go and find Mo Bai!"</p>
 <p>"Look for him..." Ye Jin smiled faintly. "I don't think I can find him right now."</p>
 <p>"What are you talking about?" Gu Qingyu obviously didn't catch the hidden meaning in his words. Before she could stop him, Ye Jin lifted her into his arms again. "Eh..."</p>
 <p>Ye Jin looks in a weirdly good mood. "Xiao Yu'er, do you think my Ye still lacks a doctor? I don't want a quack like him, hmph." With that, he walked away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was speechless.<em>&nbsp;I know you have a lot of opinion about each other, but don't call him a quack! Hey, he's a renowned Divine Doctor in the martial arts world!</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, they came to a door, which Ye Jin kicked open, and walked in.</p>
 <p>"Just hurry up and get someone to check on your hand..." Gu Qingyu frowned, but she dared not move.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, are you worried about me?" Ye Jin teased her with a grin as he set her down gently.</p>
 <p>"...Yes." She lowered her head as pink dusted her cheeks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin gawked at her. Maybe it was because he never heard such an answer from her, nor did he expect her to admit it so freely. The flush on her cheeks intensified under his watchful gaze. "That, I, um..."</p>
 <p>The remainder of her sentence disappeared as he pulled her into another warm hug.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, I love you." His arms wrapped around her tightly.</p>
 <p>"Yeah." She hugged him back, and buried her face in his chest, greedily taking in his scent.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin lowered his head and pressed a soft kiss against her forehead. "Alright, I'm gonna dress my cut now, Xiao Yu'er."</p>
 <p>"Um... okay..." Gu Qingyu blushed and watched him open the closet, there was a shelf full of white bandages.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Do you use these...often?" Her brows furrowed. Ye Jin took a random roll of bandages and unrolled it as he replied half-heartedly. "Well, sometimes things happen, so..."</p>
 <p>Before he finished speaking, Gu Qingyu pressed herself against his back and hugged him from behind.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er..." Ye Jin's hand gently covered her hand.</p>
 <p>She tried to stop herself from choking up. "You're not...allowed to do this...not anymore. Take care of yourself, don't risk your life like that."</p>
 <p>"Okay, I know." Ye Jin turned around and embraced her again. "I know, Xiao Yu'er."</p>
 <p>"Promise me." Gu Qingyu wiped the corner of her eyes. "I'll help apply the medicine."</p>
 <p>"Sure." Ye Jin looked at her tenderly, watching her take the bandage from him. She wrapped the bandage around his hand, and finally finished the dressing with a lovely bow.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>I believe friendships that have survived trials and tribulations would always last. It’s really comforting to see Gu Qingyu and Xiao Qi repair their friendship. But the fluff and the softness between Gu Qingyu and Ye Jin/Jia Qizhe. Gosh, it’s hard to not root for them when they are so cute together!</p>
