 <p><span style>“Eek... So...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh no! How did he find out?!</span></i><i></i><i><span style>Err, I mean... Well... Given that he’s been following us all this time, it’s not so surprising.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But why did Jia Qizhe tell me that there wasn’t anyone following us? Unless he lied to me! Dammit!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ha-ha!” Gu Qingyu laughed weakly. “So you knew already...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you think there could be anything in this world that could be hidden from me?” The full moon peeked out from behind the clouds. The moonlight bathed the red-robed man in a silvery light, making his face pure as a lotus blossom and his smile even more seductive. Gu Qingyu felt breathless and compelled herself to turn away for a brief moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I-I never said that.” She shrugged her shoulders. “Anyways, I spent too much time talking with you and it’s getting late. Sooo~ I’m going to leave you now because I still have to survey the area. See! You!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then I’ll just leave you alone?” Surprisingly, Xue Zang didn’t try to cling to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wait!” Before Xue Zang left, she shouted quietly, “You should stop following us!” She paused, then grumbled miserably, “We’re really no fun at all.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, no, no, no.” Xue Zang waved his finger gracefully. “I shall continue to pursue you lot. Farewell! If fate allows, we’ll meet again!” Then he vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>That prick! Can there be anyone more shameless?!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘If fate allows’ my ass! Don’t you see me everyday?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph.” Gu Qingyu snorted contemptuously and turned around... “Woah, Jia Qizhe!! Why——” she stopped and asked softly, “You’re back already! Did you finish checking the inner palace already?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” Jia Qizhe looked at her and smiled faintly, “How about you? How does it fare in the outer palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...” She was secretly rejoicing in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>It’s a good thing that he didn’t see me with Xue Zang, but how am I going to explain my progress...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Eeeh? Why am I suddenly holding onto a paper scroll?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She quickly spread open the scroll and discovered that... </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a map of the outer palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The inner palace was also roughly drawn, and there were even a couple of escape routes lined on the map.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe leaned over and curiously peeked at the scroll in her hands. His eyes became round with astonishment. “How... When did you make this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fufu~! Are you extremely shocked?” Her feeling for Xue Zang suddenly changed to immense gratitude and respect. “Stop asking so many questions. Big Sis, I, am just so amazing! ... Eh? Jia Qizhe? Where’d you go? Eh, eh? Where’s my map??? Heeeey——Jia Qizhe! Wait for meee——!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>After chasing him like a mad dog all the way back to the inn, Gu Qingyu found out that Jia Qizhe had long since returned. He had even explained his plan to everyone in the group, and they were just getting ready to set out...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>囧...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu gasped for air, “Are... </span><i><span style>huff</span></i><span style>... You saying that... </span><i><span style>huff</span></i><span style>... I have to go for another round right now?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I suppose...” Mo Bai hesitated. His eyes were still as gentle when he looked at her. “My apologies, Miss Gu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who told you to be sorry!” She flared up, “Jia Qizhe! Come here! Apologise to me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why should I?” He looked at her strangely, “Why do I owe you an apology?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because you left me!” She frowned. She knew she was being too harsh, and Jia Qizhe was bound to become angry. But he had crossed the line this time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Deep down in her heart, she felt a long forgotten anger burning fiercely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah,” he disdained to answer her. “So I have to apologize because I left before you finished talking? You must’ve never been abandoned before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t you dare! I know exactly how it feels!” she yelled. “You’ll never know how it feels to watch, helpless, as your most trusted and loved ones abandon you!!” After yelling, she ran up the stairs to her room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Soon after, someone came looking for her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you feeling better, Miss Gu?” she heard a gentle and soft voice say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Mo Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Bai...” Gu Qingyu shook her head, “I’m fine now. Let’s go. We can’t miss this chance.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm...” Mo Bai looked worryingly at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>The party arrived outside the palace walls. When Jia Qizhe finished marking the routes and dividing them into smaller units, they set off in different directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Miraculously, Gu Qingyu ended up in the same unit with Jia Qizhe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second unit of two was Mo Bai and Qi Yichen, they were responsible to remove obstacles, provide information and divert attention for the first unit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe, along with Gu Qingyu, was to infiltrate the inner palace and look for Murong Ranyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lastly, Xiao Qi was to stay on the wall and wait for the signal for emergency support.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Gu Qingyu remained quiet the whole time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe finally asked, “What are you thinking about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you angry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Continuous silence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oi...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want?” Gu Qingyu finally spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you been listening to me?” mumbled Jia Qizhe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” This time Jia Qizhe went silent for a while then asked, “Are you angry?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what?” He simply stopped in his tracks and she bumped into his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because of how he suddenly stopped, there was no chance of avoiding it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>What are you doing?!</span></i><span style>” She could only mewl in fear of being detected, even though she wanted to yell at that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop being so extremely absent-minded! Do you even realize how easy it can affect the whole operation?” He said to her very seriously, “Please stay focused! We’re not here to play games! This is the Imperial Palace, a mishap can cost a life!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I don’t feel like I’m in danger, mmhm?” Gu Qingyu looked up at him and scratched her head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Sigh——</span></i><span style>” Jia Qizhe heaved a deep sigh. “Well, if you’re not angry anymore, then concentrate on the mission. Follow me closely.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay~~~” She sped up her pace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Paaa————</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Shaaa————</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two distinct sets of soft and gentle footsteps echoed through the silent hallway.</span></p>
