 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen was quickly spotted by the guards as he made his way to the stairs. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled to himself because he knew he would be able to divert the guards’ attention. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Halt! Identify yourself!” One of the guards rushed and barred his way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This one is called Qi Yichen. May I ask who you’re looking for?” Qi Yichen responded and gave the guard a faint smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Family’s Third Young Lady, Gu Qingyu,” the guard said, then softened his tone after seeing Qi Yichen’s radiant smile. “Have you seen her?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen raised his finger and pointed in a random direction. “I believe she went that way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You have our gratitude, sir.” The people from Gu Manor had, in all respects, no bad intentions. The guards cupped their fists and went into the direction Qi Yichen pointed to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a smile still on his face, Qi Yichen continued down the stairs leisurely and left the building.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A couple guards went searching in another direction, banging on the doors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beautiful young man opened one of the doors, coquettish and gracefully, dressed in full red.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have you seen——” The guard stopped mid-sentence. “Oh my god! It’s Lord Xue Zang!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes?” The young man smiled coquettishly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! N-nothing. W-we... nothing at all!” The guards fled the scene almost immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did they really have to run? It’s not like I eat people...” muttered Xue Zang to himself and shook his head dispiritedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Qi Yichen was at the inn busily sidetracking the pursuers, the two girls and Jia Qizhe arrived at the little stream that flowed in the bamboo forest. Gu Qingyu crouched down by the water and tried to catch some small fishlings while they were waiting for Qi Yichen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Sure enough, Qi Yichen didn’t disappoint them and arrived shortly after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s here! Let’s get going!” Gu Qingyu was very eager to get to their destination as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingyu, can you fly?” asked Qi Yichen out of the blue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Gu Qingyu stood up and looked at him confusedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’re going to be travelling quite a distance, so the quickest way would be by flying.” Jia Qizhe gave her a mocking look, “Could it be that you don’t even know how to fly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Erm...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I really don’t...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I...” She didn’t know what to reply in order to avoid being made fun of him again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nevermind him, Qingyu. You can just hold onto me.” Qi Yichen grinned cheerfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, we can split up into pairs of two since there are four of us.” Jia Qizhe glanced at Gu Qingyu, then turned to Qi Yichen. “You take the little one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But I don’t want to be in a pair with you!” Gu Qingyu backed off two steps away from Jia Qizhe. “I have a fear of great heights! So I’ll leave Xiao Qi in your care!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>While the two of them were mouthing, Qi Yichen spread his summoned wings and made ready for flight. He had a pair of great, white wings protruding from his back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He grabbed Gu Qingyu’s hand while she was shrinking away from Jia Qizhe, and took a leap upwards, ascending at a startling speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe scoffed at them as they disappeared in the clouds, but without further ado, he began chanting and summoned forth a pair of huge blue wings, then gestured for Xiao Qi. Inadvertently looking back, he spread his wings and took flight with Xiao Qi on his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A short distance away, the hem of a red robe was peeking out on the side of a tall tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>High up in the sky.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu kept her eyes tightly shut and her head bent down. Her feet dangled high in the air while Qi Yichen held the crook of her arm as he soared through the wisps of fleeting clouds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What have I done to deserve this!!? Imagine dangling, flapping in the air like a paper doll!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu, looking very miserable, turned her head to see how Xiao Qi fared. In contrast to her, Xiao Qi looked very cheerful and seemed to even enjoy the flight.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I knew Jia Qizhe’s flying skills were this good, I would’ve just gone with him from the beginning!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A myriad of regrets took place in Gu Qingyu’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingyu, how do you feel?” asked Qi Yichen.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How do I feel? Hahahahahahaha.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing. Go faster!” answered Gu Qingyu tersely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After five minutes of silence, Qi Yichen couldn’t keep quiet anymore. “Qingyu, would you like to sit on my fan instead?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fan?” Gu Qingyu suddenly had a bad feeling. A very, very bad feeling! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen waved his hand, and instantly below her feet appeared a gigantic fan. He dispersed his wings and swooped down beside her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The fan resisted the wind as it glided through the sky at tremendous speed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>...!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu suddenly realized something. The innocent, harmless looking Qi Yichen, who had the appearance of an angel, was actually a two-faced, mischievous wolf in sheep’s clothing!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu waved her hand in resignation. Through a clenched mouth, she said, “This is </span><b>sooo</b><span style> most kind of you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t be so polite, there’s no need with me, Qingyu,” replied Qi Yichen with a gentle smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I shall humbly accept my defeat.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu cast an unhappy look at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe noticed that the two ahead had changed their form of flying, so he summoned forth a sword and withdrew his wings. Xiao Qi didn’t seem to mind either form of transportation method.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sky gradually grew darker as they approached their destination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stars were shining brightly in the night sky by the time they landed at the base of the designated mountain range.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are we stopping now?” She looked at Qi Yichen, half-smiling, half-doubtful. The bad feelings she had earlier were on the rise again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s quite straining on the body to keep flying for long.” He batted his eyes at her innocently. “But also this place is home to many monsters. They tend to get more active at night, so it’s more convenient to go on foot!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>... Convenient?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu pouted. “Alright then.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, you’re actually okay with it?” He shot her a surprised look.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Can you stop being so transparent!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“[So?]” Gu Qingyu gave him a frustrated stare. “Does it look like I’ve got much of a choice?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No,” replied Qi Yichen truthfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s right.” She threw Qi Yichen another glare, then hooked her arm with Xiao Qi’s and started walking up the mountain path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe conjured his sword and walked calmly, unhurriedly behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen took out his fan and did the same.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a kind of awkwardness in the air and no one said anything for a long time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, something dark flashed past Qingyu’s eyes and Jia Qizhe’s sword immediately shot out a blue ray of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oblivious to what just happened, Gu Qingyu turned around and saw Jia Qizhe leisurely putting away his sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stared at him blankly. “What was that just now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t concern yourself about it. It was merely just a tiger.” Jia Qizhe gave a nonchalant laugh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu’s facial expression seemed to say, ‘I am very perplexed and in deep shock right now’.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wh-what you’re saying right now is that you just exterminated a monster?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh-huh, if not?” Jia Qizhe tilted his head, looking at her a bit strangely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jia Qizhe has quite the reputation throughout the four empires. This is to be expected and nothing to marvel at, Qingyu,” said Qi Yichen with a smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh right~ In case you didn’t know,” Jia Qizhe grinned sinisterly at her. “I do quite enjoy monster slaying. Especially cats~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uhh...” Gu Qingyu became very distressed when she heard him mention cats. Her face changed instantly as she feigned laughter, “Ha-ha, what an interesting hobby you have! Don’t you agree, Qi Yichen?” She poked Qi Yichen with her elbow playfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did her best to not ‘let the cat out of the bag’, especially given her current background.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know right!” Qi Yichen smiled back at her. “Let’s catch some later for Jia Qizhe as training dummies!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>... I have to stop talking or I’ll die prematurely one day!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu resisted the urge to slap herself in the face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He-he-he!” Gu Qingyu laughed bitterly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>One-third of the way up the mountain, a certain young woman had finally reached her limit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Argh! I can’t... My feet... I can’t take another step!” Gu Qingyu leaned against Xiao Qi’s shoulders, all miserable and exhausted. With her umpteenth sigh of the day, she grumbled, “Why is the mountain so tall! Why is everything so hard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe and Qi Yichen continued walking, acting as natural as can be while ignoring Gu Qingyu’s cries of despair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu noticed her old methods weren’t working anymore, so she decided to change strategy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She gathered the last bit of her strength and rushed past them with a roar, and then threw herself fiercely on the ground in front of them...</span></p>
