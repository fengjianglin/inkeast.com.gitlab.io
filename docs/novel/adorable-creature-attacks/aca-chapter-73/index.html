 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu sat at the table and poured herself a cup of tea, intending to savour the conversation.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yan Zun narrowed his eyes slightly, and began, "In fact, there is more than one Spirit Gem in Xiqian. "</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu was stunned, "Two?"</p>
 <p>"There are no detailed records." Yan Zun also poured himself a cup of tea, and took a sip lightly. "Xiqian has over thousands of years of history. According to their records, a great battle broke out here. I’ve been wondering, but I didn’t expect it to be here."</p>
 <p>"What battle?" Gu Qingyu asked curiously.</p>
 <p>Yan Zun's fingers rubbed the cup carefully. "It was between tens of thousands of soldiers and one man. "</p>
 <p>"That's amazing!" Gu Qingyu exclaimed. "Who won in the end?"</p>
 <p>"No one. The man died, and the army was annihilated." Yan Zun picked up the cup and finished the tea in one gulp.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"That's a tragic ending..." Gu Qingyu scratched her head. "Who is that person?"</p>
 <p>Yan Zun curled his lips. "I don't know."</p>
 <p><em>That was disappointing to hear.&nbsp;</em>"You don't know?"</p>
 <p>"Few even know this big battle, let alone the names of the people involved." Yan Zun nodded, slowly floated up from his seat. "Okay, go to sleep quickly. You still have your clothes to pick up tomorrow."</p>
 <p><em>That doesn't seem to have anything to do with you …&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu pursed her lips and nodded. "Then enjoy your floating, I'll go to bed first." Yan Zun smiled and continued to drift in the air. Gu Qingyu slipped into the covers and soon fell asleep. A dreamless night.</p>
 <p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Early Morning</strong></p>
 <p>She woke up on time, dressed and went to the kitchen to get a bowl of porridge and came to Qi Yichen's room. Qi Yichen had also just woke up. He seemed a bit lost when he saw her, but then he smiled and greeted her with a nod. "Morning, Qingyu."</p>
 <p>"Morning, let's eat." Gu Qingyu held up the bowl of porridge. <em>The Qi Yichen now seems to be a man who has lost something extremely precious, and yet he also looks as though he finally found something he had lost for years. It's heartbreaking to watch him be like this.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Yichen finished feeding Qi Yichen and put away the bowl. Qi Yichen clicked his tongue and laughed. "Ah! This scholar is currently enjoying the treatment that many people outside could only dream of!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Save it." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Rest well." She closed the door on her way out. She felt Jia Qizhe, Qitan, and everyone's resentful gaze before she even turned around.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu laughed dryly. "What are you all doing? Go get breakfast, and do whatever you need to do."</p>
 <p>She went to the kitchen and placed the bowl in the sink, and went to the dining hall for breakfast. Jia Qizhe opened his mouth, he was just about to say something, but Qi Wan cut him off as he hopped over to Gu Qingyu. "Boss, let's go pick up the clothes!"</p>
 <p>"Sure!" Gu Qingyu stood up. "Jia Qizhe, what were you going to say?"</p>
 <p>"No, it's nothing." Jia Qizhe glanced at Qi Wan, the threatening look in his eyes contradicted his words.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan swallowed nervously, but he fearlessly tugged on Gu Qingyu's sleeve. "Boss, hurry up!"</p>
 <p>"Well, okay." Gu Qingyu nodded. "Jia Qizhe, are you coming?"</p>
 <p>"You two go ahead, I have something to take care of." Jia Qizhe said with a clenched jaw.. "Have fun."</p>
 <p>"Yep!" Qi Wan smiled and walked out the door with Gu Qingyu. For some reason, there had been a chilly sensation along his spine. It unsettled him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At the shop, the shopkeeper greeted her as soon as she saw Gu Qingyu. "You came just at the right time, miss! Come and try your clothes!"</p>
 <p>"Okay." When she saw the clothes, Gu Qingyu's mood naturally changed. <em>As the saying goes, girls, we all love pretty things!</em></p>
 <p>She walked into a small room, and her eyes laid on the dress that was laid out on the table. A light, silver chiffon gently enveloped the pink long skirt. The natural waistline made it look casual, but the flare of the skirt emphasised her hips. A single peach blossom was embroidered on the sleeve. Bold and beautiful, the dress really suited her. Gu Qingyu was nodding with admiration as she slipped into the dress. The dress fitted her like a glove, she checked her reflection in a bronze mirror and was even happier with the dress. Gu Qingyu untied her hair and changed her hairstyle, one that used the wooden hairpin Jia Qizhe gave her. She adjusted her dress. Then, an idea for a prank popped into her mind. She pulled out a handkerchief from her sleeve and walked out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was still talking and laughing with the shopkeeper. When he saw Gu Qingyu, he froze for a moment, and his eyes grew so wide they almost popped out. Gu Qingyu copied the people in period dramas, gently covered her lips with the handkerchief, and smiled shyly. Qi Wan's face turned from shock to horror, as though he had seen a ghost. The shopkeeper also stared at her with an unflinching, horrified gaze.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu 'smiled shyly' again. "Mister, what's wrong with you?"</p>
 <p>"Miss, please return my Boss to me..." Qi Wan swallowed thickly, the image in front of him was just too much for him.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu replied with a flick of a wrist and waved the handkerchief. "But, I am your Boss. Does this mister doubt such a young lady?"</p>
 <p>"Miss..." Qi Wan suddenly wanted to blind himself. "You are so beautiful, would you like to get coffee sometime?"</p>
 <p>"No." Gu Qingyu smiled sheepishly and bowed slightly to the shopkeeper. "This young lady thanks you for the wonderful dress."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh, no, no, no, Miss." The shopkeeper immediately stopped her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu left the shop with feather light steps, as though she was walking on clouds.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan immediately kept up with her. "Boss, wait for me!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After walking for a while, Gu Qingyu turned to Qi Wan. "Mister, this young lady wants to have some sweets."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan immediately handed over the candied hawthorns he had bought. "Boss, please!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled gently, took the stick, and nibbled on the fruit. "Hm, so sweet."</p>
 <p>"Boss, I beg you to change back soon..." Qi Wan slapped himself, the cognitive dissonance was just too much for him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What do you mean, mister?" Gu Qingyu leaned into him.</p>
 <p>A granny, who was passing by, sighed. "The girls today are so bold!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan's face was as red as a tomato. "Boss, I still think that men's clothing is more suitable for you..."</p>
 <p>"Is it." Gu Qingyu smiled softly, and suddenly shouted. "F*** men's fashion! The only reason I wore it in the first place was to avoid my family. And now that's settled, you won't even let me change back! Do you think this is easy for me? Huh?"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan covered his face and cried out. "Boss! You are finally back! Just now an alien has occupied your body! I was so scared!"</p>
 <p>"F***!" Gu Qingyu turned away and took a huge bite from the candied hawthorns before she sauntered off.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan wiped away his non-existent tears and followed. "Boss, listen to me, you can still do this to the rest... Erm, except for Qi Yichen, that might be too much of a shock for him."</p>
 <p>"Hm, good idea." Gu Qingyu munched away, the sugar shell of the candied hawthorns crackled in her mouth, the sound scared Qi Wan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He dabbed his forehead nervously. "Boss, your dress is really beautiful... I just haven't gotten used to it yet." With those words, he managed to somewhat salvage Gu Qingyu's pride.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They returned to the inn. As they walked through the main entrance, Gu Qingyu saw Murong Zuoyu drinking tea in the main hall. Murong Zuoyu saw Gu Qingyu in that pink dress and froze completely. Gu Qingyu bowed and tossed her handkerchief. "It's good to see you, Mister Murong."</p>
 <p><em>Cough cough!</em> He immediately spat out the tea. <em>Well, it's hard to imagine Murong Zuoyu breaking his poise, until now.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled shyly at Murong Zuoyu. "Mister, do be careful when drinking tea~"</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu entered a coughing fit. Gu Qingyu walked past Murong Zuoyu and went on. Qi Wan glanced at Murong Zuoyu sympathetically. His reaction was worse than Qi Wan's reaction. He jogged for two steps and kept up with Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xia Zang was in the backyard, playing with birds. A small yellow bird hopped about on his arm.</p>
 <p>"Mister Xie~" Gu Qingyu approached him with a swing in her steps.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Zang was stunned for the first time. He loosened his hand and the bird flew away.</p>
 <p>"Kitten, what's going on here today?" Xie Zang was remarkable, he snapped back to his senses much faster than the others.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled sweetly. "This young lady just wanted to change her style~"</p>
 <p>"Well, this is very good. Pink and red match well." Xie Zang nodded with a satisfied look.</p>
 <p><em>Huh?&nbsp;</em>This makes Gu Qingyu react.<em>&nbsp;I thought pink matches with blue...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Her prank on Xie Zang did not work out as intended, she decided to prank Mo Bai instead. She strolled in front, Qi Wan followed behind her and kept laughing. Gu Qingyu turned back impatiently. "What's wrong?"</p>
 <p>"Hahahaha, you didn't see Brother Murong's reaction... it’s enough for me to laugh for a year, hahaha..." Qi Wan held his stomach and laughed. They happened to walk past the firewood storeroom. Gu Qingyu glanced at that room, grabbed Qi Wan by the collar, yanked open the door, and threw Qi Wan into the storeroom before he could react. She finished the sequence of actions by locking the door. One of the staff of the tavern passed by them. <em>Why is that girl so familiar... if not I'm not mistaken, then that man is our boss... Should I go up to save the boss...</em></p>
 <p>Suddenly, he saw the girl turned around and smiled glamorously at him.</p>
 <p><em>Ah, what a pretty girl, I suddenly remembered that I have not washed the dishes yet. Sorry boss, I'll burn some paper money for you every year…&nbsp;</em>The staff member walked away in a hurry.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled with satisfaction and walked upstairs to Mo Bai's room. Mo Bai had his back towards her, he seemed to be studying something. Gu Qingyu leaned closer, it was a couple of leaves. Mo Bai seemed to have sensed her presence and raised his head. The moment he looked up, he paused. His whole body turned rigid, as if he had been petrified.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yu...er?" Mo Bai blinked, as if he could not recognise her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes?" Gu Qingyu whispered sweetly.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai was obviously surprised, but it was Mo Bai, and he quickly calmed down. "Yu'er, did you change your clothes?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, I did." Gu Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>The tips of his ears had turned pink, as pink as her dress. "Well, it's beautiful. It's perfect for you."</p>
