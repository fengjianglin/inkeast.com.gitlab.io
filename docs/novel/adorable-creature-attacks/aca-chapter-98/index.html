<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>"Here, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin lifted the teapot on the table, poured a cup of tea, and handed it to Gu Qingyu. "You must be thirsty, have some tea."</p>
 <p>The three of them gawked at the sight. <em>Leader, can you please let us leave! Seeing such weak-willed behaviour from the Leader, will we be silenced and killed?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and said nothing.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er!" Ye Jin finally understood that his wife could only take so much teasing. Now that he has successfully angered her, then he would have to coax her back even if he was going to die.</p>
 <p>"Be good, don't be angry, I'm wrong." He switched tactics and went with a softer, sweeter voice. "Xiao Yu'er~"</p>
 <p>The sweet voice made the three other individuals wish to gouge out their eyeballs (?). <em>Leader! We really can't hear anything, and we can't see anything!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned towards him and finally realised that Ye Jin is a big softie on the inside. "So you're aware of your mistake?"</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Ye Jin nodded obediently.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took the cup of hot tea from Ye Jin, then she turned around and remembered that there were three other people in the room with them. Because the three of them were well trained, they had been concealing their presence as they waited for Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin straightened up and glanced at Wind, Lighting and Thunder. "When did the three of you come in?"</p>
 <p>Wind and Thunder are about to cry. <em>Weren't you the one that let us in, Leader?</em></p>
 <p>Lightning, on the other hand, was more clever. "Leader Ye, the three of us only came in just now."</p>
 <p>"Huh." Ye Jin nodded in satisfaction, "Speak, what's the matter?"</p>
 <p>"Your subordinate has just finished the task, we are here to report on our findings. " Wind knelt on one knee. "The first prince of Dongxian has been assassinated."</p>
 <p>"The first prince of Dong Xuan?" Gu Qingyu looked at Ye Jin with doubt.</p>
 <p>"Yes, it's Murong Qize." Ye Jin reached out and stroked Gu Qingyu's head. "Xiao Yu'er, whoever that dares to bully you would never end well."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu beamed at him. "Thank you, Xiao Zhezhe!"</p>
 <p>Wind cringed at that sight. <em>Leader! Madam!&nbsp;</em><em>Can you shower such affection at another time? The subordinates are still watching!</em></p>
 <p>"How about you?" Ye Jin looked at Lightning and Thunder.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Nightingale insists on seeing you, but she was stopped, as per your orders." Lightning frowned.</p>
 <p>As one of the four executives, Lightning felt sympathy for Nightingale, but Madam is still here!</p>
 <p>"Drag her away." Ye Jin didn't even frown. "She’s exiled."</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Lightning lowered his head. To be honest, the punishment of the Leader is really too... It was likely that he spared Nightingale due to her past loyalty. But for people like them, they are nothing without Ye.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Leave." Ye Jin glanced at the three.</p>
 <p>"Yes! Your subordinates will take their leave, Leader, Madam." &nbsp;The three of them spoke in unison.</p>
 <p>"Wait." Ye Jin gently picked up a cup of tea and took a sip. "From now on, call her Queen."</p>
 <p>"……Yes!" Gu Qingyu glared at Ye Jin, snatched over his cup and drank from it instead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, you’re thirsty?" Ye Jin looked at her in a puzzled manner. After Gu Qingyu finished drinking, Ye Jin immediately picked up the teapot and poured another cup for her.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu almost spewed blood. "No! Thank you!"</p>
 <p>"Alright then. Xiao Yu'er, it's time to have lunch." Ye Jin looked out the window, the weather was beautifully warm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay!" Gu Qingyu whispered and walked out with Ye Jin.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As they headed downstairs, Gu Qingyu saw several people surrounding Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>"What are you doing? What's wrong?" Gu Qingyu walked over and stood in front of Qi Wan, shielding him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A few people saw Gu Qingyu, first stunned, then quickly knelt on one knee. "Madam!"</p>
 <p>Ye Jin was standing behind them and concealed his presence, so they didn't notice him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Well, get up." Gu Qingyu turned around and looked at Qi Wan, "What happened, Qi Wan?"</p>
 <p>"Boss, they bullied me!" Qi Wan stared at her with watery eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Bullying?" Gu Qingyu frowned, "It’ll be enough if you don't bully others!"</p>
 <p>Although she said so, Gu Qingyu turned to look at the crowd. "What happened?"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"He was trying to mess with Sister Nightingale!" A man stood up, staring at Qi Wan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh, is that right?" Gu Qingyu didn't go to see Qi Wan, but waited for the man without showing any weakness. "Well, your Sister Nightingale tried to mess with me!"</p>
 <p>The man froze for a moment, revealing a clear disbelief, but he stopped because the other person was Madam.</p>
 <p>"Do you know, because she is going to change jobs, and I feel very bad so I wanted to send her off. But I didn't expect to be beaten by her!" Gu Qingyu sighed, "Ah! Hell hath no fury as a woman scorned!"</p>
 <p>The man eyed her suspiciously. Hell hath no fury as a woman scorned indeed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This thing tells us that your well-intentions may not be well-received. An old witch might misjudge your intentions!" Gu Qingyu nodded strongly at her own words. "So! We need to prevent fire, prevent theft and prevent witches!"</p>
 <p>That man was stunned. <em>Did Madam just call Sister Nightingale a witch?</em></p>
 <p>"Ah!" Gu Qingyu sighed again, knowing that Nightingale was highly respected by this group of people. No matter what she said, it would be difficult to change their impression of her bullying Nightingale.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At this moment, Crow joined them. The group saw Crow and immediately lowered their heads and bowed. "Crow!"</p>
 <p>"Yes." Crow still wears a smiley mask, making it impossible for him to see his expression. "Madam was tolerant and kind, but Nightingale violated the regulations of the organisation on her own accord, so she was exiled." &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Is this true?" Obviously, Crow held more respect among these people, but one of them still questioned. He was doubtful, but his eyes showed the disappointment he had already believed.</p>
 <p>"Are you doubting me?" Crow glanced at the man lightly.</p>
 <p>The man immediately knelt on one knee. "Dare not!"</p>
 <p>Crow “hummed”, and then walked to the front of Gu Qingyu, kneeling on one knee. “Madam.”</p>
 <p>Crow showed absolute subservience to her, which also made those present unavoidably respect Gu Qingyu more.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Ye Jin came slowly, and everyone immediately knelt down when they saw Ye Jin "Leader."</p>
 <p>At the same time, they were all anxiously sweating. <em>God! How much did the Leader hear? They are all familiar with the Leader's love for Madam, they heard that the Leader actually put his sister into the dungeon for Madam! And what about them? Would they meet the same fate as Miss Ye Ya? Even if they had nine lives, it would never be enough!</em></p>
 <p>Ye Jin ignored them, walked straight to Gu Qingyu. "What's the matter, Xiao Yu'er?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu glanced at everyone, and then smiled at Ye Jin. "It's fine."</p>
 <p>"Let's go." Ye Jin gently took Gu Qingyu's hand.</p>
 <p>"... Sure." Gu Qingyu said</p>
 <p>She gave his hand a slight squeeze and walked forward. Once the pair had gotten far away enough, the people in the crowd glanced at each other and sighed with relief.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan’s eyes lowered to the ground, a hint of loneliness escaped from his careful concealment before he kept up with Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The pair arrived at the dining room, Gu Qingyu was surprised to see the excellent meals.</p>
 <p>She rushed to her seat, while Qi Wan exclaimed in surprise as he entered the room.</p>
 <p>"What about the others?" Gu Qingyu looked around and found that she, Ye Jin and Qi Wan were the only three.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu." Xiao Qi's voice came.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned around and saw Xiao Qi and Murong Zuoyu sitting by the door, she waved back and beckoned them with a smile. "Come, take a seat, we will resume the journey tomorrow."</p>
 <p>"Tomorrow?" Murong Zuoyu frowned. "And the destination?"</p>
 <p>"... Nanyou." Gu Qingyu smiled slightly, "The next Spirit Gem is there."</p>
 <p>"Well." Murong Zuoyu nodded slightly. "Very good. We would soon have travelled all over this entire continent."</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Gu Qingyu was also rather impressed. "We actually visited every single country here! It's not easy! Oh, where are the roads less travelled, they are right there beneath your feet!"</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu was perplexed by her statement.</p>
 <p>"To think that I would one day have seen the world." Qi Wan opened the white fan in his hand and fanned himself. "It's truly a feat!"</p>
 <p><em>Why are you lamenting about life all of a sudden? Also, where did your fan come from?</em></p>
 <p>The door was kicked open again, and Qi Yichen stormed in with a huff. "Qi Wan xx you xx! X! Give me back my fan!"</p>
 <p>"Only an xx will return it to you!" Qi Wan rolled his eyes. "Do you really take me as a xxx?"</p>
 <p>"I x! Is it fun for the two of you to xxxx swear back and forth like this?" Gu Qingyu also rolled her eyes, "Hurry to eat, or both of you will not get a single morsel!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Right then, Qi Wan immediately threw the fan on the chair, grabbed his chopsticks and began to shove food into his mouth. His speed could match a starved ghost. And right as Qi Wan threw away the fan, it fell into Qi Yichen's hand. Qi Yichen also tossed it aside, took his seat next to Qi Wan and shoved food into his mouth. He even found the time to steal from Qi Wan's bowl.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan stared at Qi Yichen with his eyes wide, his mouth was stuffed to the brim. With just a look in his eyes, he told Qi Yichen, "Try me, I dare you. I'll spit this entire mouthful of rice on your face!"</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen glared back at him without showing any weakness. “You're not the only one who can flare up! I also have a temper! Don't think you're the only one who knows how to spit rice! Come! Go ahead! Do you think I'm scared of you?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu squinted at the two of them, and unceremoniously rewarded them with a red bump each. "Are you two not tired? Do you even have to flirt during mealtimes?"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan and Qi Yichen looked at Gu Qinyu in unison. "And just how did you see that the two of us were flirting?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, don't stare at me with such wide eyes just because I saw through the both of you. It's not like you two were being discreet about your interest in each other." Gu Qingyu mumbled as she returned to her food.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan and Qi Yichen no longer dared to glare at each other anymore, they both lowered their heads and concentrated on eating.</p>
 <p>"Oh, where's Mo Bai? Why isn't he here?" Gu Qingyu looked around and frowned.</p>
 <p>"Oh, him." Ye Jin slowly filled her bowl. "He said he doesn't feel well."</p>
 <p>"He’s still unwell?" She blinked doubtfully.</p>
 <p>"Yes, Doctor Mo's body may be quite weak." Ye Jin shook his head with a sigh.</p>

 <p>Sorry for the delay, this chapter was supposed to come out yesterday, but things in my life are kind of a mess right now, so I had to take a day off. I made an announcement about it on Discord, so do join the server if you want to stay updated, although I promise I would try my best to avoid these kinds of announcements in the future.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On a different note, it looks like we will hit the 100th chapter tomorrow! I have nothing planned right now, so if you have any suggestions, do let me know, and I’ll see what I can do.</p>
