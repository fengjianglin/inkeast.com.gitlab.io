 <p>The bowl of porridge was soon emptied and Gu Qingyu took the empty bowl from Mo Bai. "Then take a good rest first, I won't keep you up."</p>
 <p>He nodded and showed her a gentle smile. "Yu'er, good night."</p>
 <p>"Huh!" She returned his smile and exited his room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu glanced at the row of rooms and decided to visit Xiao Qi. She walked to the door of Xiao Qi's room and tapped gently, but no one answered.</p>
 <p>"Brother Zhu?" Qi Yichen walked out of his room and stretched lazily. "Stop knocking, Qi Wan and she went for a walk."</p>
 <p>"Walk?" Gu Qingyu stunned for a moment, and then nodded secretly in her heart. <em>Yes, yes, this kid finally came around!</em></p>
 <p>"Yeah," Qi Yichen raised his eyebrows and opened his fan. "Why, like this, Brother Zhu, don't you believe me?"</p>
 <p>"No!" Gu Qingyu shook her head immediately, "I just feel happy for Qi Wan's awareness."</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen frowned at her clarification. <em>Awareness?</em></p>
 <p>He laughed dryly. "Brother Zhu, it's not too early, hurry and get some sleep!"</p>
 <p>"Yeah!" Gu Qingyu said with a smile, and hurried down the stairs. <em>Rest? Of course I'm going to check how Xiao Qi and Qi Wan are doing!</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu walked briskly to the front door of the tower. She was walking so fast that she nearly ran into someone at a turn. That person didn't hesitate to grab Gu Qingyu's hand and tossed her over their back. When Gu Qingyu reacted, she was already flying through the air and her wrist was still grasped by the person, and she was about to fall flat to the floor. She focused and grasped the person's shoulder with her backhand, supporting her body and helping her land safely. After landing, the person turned around. Only then did Gu Qingyu see who that person was. That person was a very beautiful woman, but there was a chill and murderous intent in her eyes</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Who are you?" The woman looked at Gu Qingyu coldly, her hands falling on the whip hanging off her waist.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu understood that this person was someone from Ye, and she waved her hands and smiled "I'm with Ye too!"</p>
 <p>"Oh? Really?" The woman sneered. "Name?"</p>
 <p><em>It seems that she likes to command people too.&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu sighed, and the woman was about to swing her whip, but a voice—"Nightingale, stop!"</p>
 <p>Nightingale withdrew her whip and turned to follow the voice. "Crow?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned around, although the crow still wore a smiling mask, which still seemed a little scary, but her eyes lit up, her savior was here. "Uncle Crow!"</p>
 <p>Hearing this moniker again, Crow coughed. "Madam." He knelt on one knee.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was stunned, she did not expect Crow to kneel and immediately went up to help him to his feet. "Get up!"</p>
 <p>"Nightingale, are you not going to greet the Madam?" Crow did not get up, but looked up at Nightingale.</p>
 <p>Nightingale was stunned for a while, and then knelt down on one knee. "Madam, your subordinate has offended you. Please forgive your subordinate."</p>
 <p>"Get up." Gu Qingyu frowned, "You all don't need to greet me and kneel like this. Just call me Gu Qingyu or Qingyu..."</p>
 <p>Crow stood up and nodded. "Yes."</p>
 <p>"Eh? Did you just agree to this?" Gu Qingyu looked at Crow in surprise.</p>
 <p>"The leader just said," Crow paused. "If his order contradicts yours, then yours shall prevail."</p>
 <p>Nightingale also stood up. Her expression was still cold, but Gu Qingyu still could see the hidden surprise in her eyes.</p>
 <p>"Ma... cough, Qingyu, it's so late, where are you going?" Crow's smiling face mask looked a little creepy against the candlelight.</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan and Xiao Qi seem to be walking outside, and I want to find them." Gu Qingyu looked out of the small window, revealing a little worry in her eyebrows.</p>
 <p>"Your subordinate will go with you. There are many demons around here at night, and there is also a fog right now. It is easy to get lost." Crow nodded at Nightingale.</p>
 <p>"Yes." Nightingale went upstairs.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at Nightingale, then at Crow, and also nodded. "Uncle Crow, let's go."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>In the Forest</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu and Crow trekked carefully. A ball of flame burned brightly in his hand, lighting up his smiley mask. The white fog surrounded them, and she could not help but lean into his side to avoid getting lost. He turned around to look at her, and finally, stretched out his hand. "Be careful, Qingyu, demons can also hide in the fog."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu reached out and gently held Crow's outstretched hand, thanking him with a smile. His hands were icy cold.</p>
 <p>"Can you shout here?" Gu Qingyu asked tentatively.</p>
 <p>Crow nodded. "Yes."</p>
 <p>With his clarification, Gu Qingyu called out into the fog. "Qi Wan! Xiao Qi!" There was no response. <em>I trust in Qi Wan's fighting ability, Xiao Qi's skills are not bad either, so they should be able to handle the demons in the area. But why aren't they back yet?</em></p>
 <p>"Qingyu, careful." Suddenly, a scythe appeared in Crow's hand and it whistled as it sliced through the fog. Gu Qingyu's night vision function turned on automatically, and she saw a giant demon in front of them. Crow moved forward calmly and the scythe spun around him. She couldn't see his expression under that mask. The demon pounced on Crow, and Crow waved the scythe. The demon was cleaved cleanly in half. Blood came down on the both of them like rain, and Crow stretched out the scythe to shelter himself and Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Awesome, Uncle Crow!" Gu Qingyu said with heartfelt admiration.</p>
 <p>"Is it." Crow didn't mind and looked at the left. "I sensed someone there, let's go take a look."</p>
 <p>"Good!" Gu Qingyu nodded and followed Crow.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Just halfway through, she saw Qi Wan and Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>"Boss, why are you here?" Qi Wan was shocked when he saw Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes angrily. "You still need to ask? Both of you were out for so long! So where did you bring Xiao Qi? Spit it out!"</p>
 <p>"I just took a walk with Xiao Qi, and we just kept walking. Eventually, I realised that we were lost..." Qi Wan scratched his head embarrassingly.</p>
 <p>"Well, Xiao Qi, are you okay?" Gu Qingyu walked to Xiao Qi's side and placed her hand on her head.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi nodded. "Yes, I'm fine!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled and patted Xiao Qi. "Let's go, thank you Uncle Crow this time!"</p>
 <p>"No need to say thanks." A flame ignited in Crow's hand and walked forward.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu followed Crow, and beside her were Qi Wan and Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>"Hey, dude! to be honest, you can be more passionate and enthusiastic!" Qi Wan jumped to Crow's side and slapped him on the shoulder. Crow glanced at Qi Wan, his smiling mask glowing coldly.</p>
 <p>"Ok, I'm gonna back off now..." Qi Wan immediately turned back to Gu Qingyu's side. Gu Qingyu glanced at Qi Wan sympathetically, without speaking.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Back in the tower, after sending Xiao Qi upstairs, Qi Wan waved at Gu Qingyu. "Go to bed early, I'll go to bed first. Boss good night~"</p>
 <p>"Good night." Gu Qingyu smiled and watched Qi Wan walk into his room.</p>
 <p>"Please follow me." Crow bowed and gestured down the hallway. Gu Qingyu nodded and followed Crow.</p>
 <p>"Your room is at the end of this hallway." Crow bowed again and all the lighting in the hallway lit up, it still seemed cramped in the dark.</p>
 <p>"Okay, you should go and rest as soon as possible." Gu Qingyu nodded and walked into the room.</p>
 <p>As soon as Gu Qingyu entered the room, she could explode.</p>
 <p><em>What sort of situation is this!</em></p>
 <p>The light blue walls make the room look dreamy and elegant, and the large light blue bed looks soft and comfy. Any ornament and decoration is blue, and the candles on the table glowed with a pale blue light, but it made the room seem more ethereal.</p>
 <p>"This..." Gu Qingyu just wanted to turn around to check again with Crow, but when she opened the door, Crow was already gone. She sighed, shook her head, and laid down on the bed.</p>
 <p><em>I haven’t seen Master for a long time and said, I’m really not used to his absence...</em></p>
 <p>She took out the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny from her sleeve and turned it over in her hand. Her fingers gently ran along with the facets of the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny, the jewel glowed under her touch.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Without it, would I not be here now? If there is no Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny, then I would never need to form a team, and I would never meet everyone. Sure, a lot of them were after the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny in the beginning, but I'm still grateful for them. Without their company, this journey would have been much more difficult. Because someone will automatically take on your hardships, and your shoulders are no longer sore. And we would all carry each other’s load, until we reach that place where dawn breaks. No one would be left behind.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>She smiled briefly, tucked the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny back inside her sleeves, and turned over. "I wonder when Yan Zun will..."</p>
 <p>"Ah!" Gu Qingyu yelled softly when she saw Yan Zun lying beside her.</p>
 <p>"Stupid apprentice, it took you so long to notice your master." Yan Zun propped up his head with one hand, and his hair spread down his chest, with a charming light in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu swallowed. "Yes... Master, how long have you been here?"</p>
 <p>"Your master has been lying here for a long time," Yan Zun raised an eyebrow. "Then I saw someone turning my original body over and over in her hands."</p>
 <p>"Urgh, enough, Master..." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Have you recovered?"</p>
 <p>"Yes," Yan Zun laughed, "So, had my divine beast successfully transformed?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, the transformation was a success." Gu Qingyu looked at Yan Zun, "Actually, you already knew this would happen?"</p>
 <p>"I was not absolutely certain." Yan Zun shrugged. "It's just a precaution."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was speechless. <em>This stupid rock!</em></p>

 <p>Nightingale was briefly mentioned earlier as the only female executive of Ye. The four executives of Ye are Crow, Lightning, Thunder and Nightingale, and all of them work for Ye and Ye Jin.&nbsp;</p>
