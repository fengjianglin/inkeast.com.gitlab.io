 <p>"Eh? Why would he not let you take off that mask?" Gu Qingyu was even more puzzled.</p>
 <p>"Truth be told, I do have a sad backstory." Crow looked down at the ground, and then looked up at the sky. <em>Will I get smote for saying something like this?</em></p>
 <p>The other two people behind him were obviously trying to hold their laughter. Crow turned around, and they schooled their faces to a serious expression.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu blinked. "Well, Uncle Crow, are we going to reach there soon?"</p>
 <p>"Yes." Crow glanced ahead. "Miss Gu, do prepare yourself."</p>
 <p>"For what?" Gu Qingyu said, tilting her head. "What did you guys do to her?"</p>
 <p><em>To be honest, the Spider Queen was here to kill me, and there is absolutely no room for mercy. So no matter how Jia Qizhe handles the Spider Queen, I would not think that he crossed the line. I'm no saint. Plead pretentiously for some random person who tried to kill me? Let someone else do that!</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As they talked, the group stopped outside a door. Crow stepped aside and bowed. "Miss Gu, please."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "Thank you." She pushed open the door and walked in. A faint scent greeted her as soon as she opened the door. &nbsp;Gu Qingyu was puzzled, but she continued to walk in. Crow followed her, walked to a cabinet and pushed it gently. The cabinet opened with ease, and revealed a set of hidden stairs that lead down. With Crow's prompting, Gu Qingyu walked down the stairs and saw the Spider Queen, dressed in full black. The Spider Queen sat cross-legged on the floor, her hands and feet were not tied, but she looked very tired, and she did not look like she was about to jump onto Gu QIngyu and throw a web over her. The Spider Queen merely looked up from the sound.</p>
 <p>Seeing the Spider Queen like this, Gu Qingyu did not feel anything. Actually, sometimes she has found herself cruel. But passivity was not going to save anyone, and she doesn't think there was anything wrong with it.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"You..." Gu Qingyu moved her lips, and finally looked at the Spider Queen with a cold face. "Why do you want to kill me?"</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen raised her head, her hair clung to her face and she did not bother to push it aside. The charming, enchanting glint in her eyes had disappeared. "Someone requested it."</p>
 <p><em>So cooperative?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu questioned her sudden openness, but her cold face remained unchanged. "Who?"</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen answered with a faint breath. "From...."</p>
 <p>Before she finished her sentence, her neck jerked and twisted to an angle beyond anything possible in human anatomy. Gu Qingyu was shocked. She went up immediately and placed her hand against the Spider Queen's neck. Nothing. There was no longer a pulse.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What..." Gu Qingyu frowned, then stepped out immediately with furrowed brows.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As soon as she went out, she saw that Crow was standing at the door. Crow was confused when he saw her. "What's wrong, Miss Gu?"</p>
 <p>"The Spider Queen was killed." Gu Qingyu's face was calm.</p>
 <p>Crow did not notice anyone else, which meant that whoever killed the Spider Queen was much stronger and more skilled than Crow, enough to completely hide his own presence. And clearly, for someone who has been at Jia Qizhe's side for a long time, Crow was quite skilled.</p>
 <p>"What?" The person in the smiley face mask was obviously surprised, and immediately ran into the chamber. The other two people stood at the door shared worrying looks. But Gu Qingyu looked worse than all of them. After all, she and the Spider Queen were the only ones in that room, and the Spider Queen obviously had no power to fight back. Therefore, in their eyes, it was only reasonable for them to suspect that she killed the Spider Queen. Not just reasonable, it was very likely.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After Crow came out from that room, he bowed to Gu Qingyu. "I apologise, Miss Gu."</p>
 <p>"Eh?" Gu Qingyu froze, "Why are you apologising?"</p>
 <p>"I did not notice and let the Spider Queen be killed." Crow paused. "Fortunately, Miss Gu is safe, otherwise I'm afraid I would not be able to redeem myself, even if I give up my life."</p>
 <p>"Don't say that..." Gu Qingyu waved immediately. "Are you not suspicious that I might have killed her?"</p>
 <p>"And why would that matter?" A man beside Crow hmphed disdainfully.</p>
 <p>"The leader said that everything you do is absolutely correct! There is no other perfect move!" Another man answered, "Even if you kill us, it would not change anything."</p>
 <p><em>I very much believe that this is Jia Qizhe's original words!</em></p>
 <p>She rolled her eyes: "Come on, we should still report this to...Ye Jin."</p>
 <p>"Okay, then I will take my leave. If anything happens, Lighting and Thunder are at your disposal." Crow bowed and left the room.</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu smiled and turned to look at Lighting and Thunder. "I'll go back and see Mo Bai, you two are free to do as you please."</p>
 <p>Lighting and Thunder nodded in unison. "We will escort you back."</p>
 <p>"Sure." Gu Qingyu accepted their offer and left the room.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It didn't take long for her to return to her original place. Xiao Qi was standing at the doorway, and there was no one beside her.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi?" Gu Qingyu immediately walked over, "What's wrong? Why are you here all by yourself?"</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi looked at Gu Qingyu, shook her head, and opened her door. "Xiao Yu, come in."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu walked in. "Qi... What about Qi Wan?"</p>
 <p>"He said he went to find you." There was no light in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"An, he's just off galavanting or something, don't think about it." Gu Qingyu rubbed Xiao Qi's head. "Don't think too much, I'll bring him back. You get some rest, ok?"</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi nodded. "Okay."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu got up, pushed open the door and went out.</p>
 <p><em>Qi Wan, this guy just keeps finding new things to make me worry about...&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu couldn't help but sigh, looked up, and saw a white robe.</p>
 <p>"Mo Bai?" Gu Qingyu blinked, then smiled. "Have you seen Qi Wan?"</p>
 <p>Mo Bai nodded and glanced at the stairs. "I think he went down."</p>
 <p>"Ok, I'll go find him." Gu Qingyu ran downstairs, not paying attention to Mo Bai's expression. Mo Bai smiled gently, just like usual.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu went down the stairs, as expected, she saw Qi Wan with a worried face. As soon as he saw her, he practically jumped on her. "Boss! Where have you been! I missed you!"</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay." Gu Qingyu slapped away his hands. "Qi Wan, I need to talk to you."</p>
 <p>"What is it?" Qi Wan listened intently.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Ahem, what do you think about Xiao Qi?"</p>
 <p>"What do I think?" Qi Wan blinked, puzzled. "She's a nice girl."</p>
 <p>"Hm..." Gu Qingyu was silent, she was suddenly at a loss for words.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was even more confused. "Boss, this is not your style, what's the matter? Just speak your mind!"</p>
 <p>"Then I will address the elephant in the room." Gu Qingyu began. "Xiao Qi likes you, ok?</p>
 <p>"I'm aware..." Qi Wan nodded.</p>
 <p>"I hope you can find some time to talk to her." Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan seriously. "You are also a big boy. Xiao Qi is a good girl. If you do like her, don't waste each other's time."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan froze for a while, then raised an eyebrow mockingly. "I'm a big boy? That doesn't mean that I want to be tied down!"</p>
 <p>"Tch, Stop pretending, do you think I don't know what you are thinking?"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was stunned, and then his face showed obvious embarrassment and unease. "You already knew?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah." She smirked.</p>
 <p>"Uh, Boss, actually I ..." Qi Wan scratched his head, "I ..."</p>
 <p>"There's a limit to playing hard to get! You can't just keep stringing her along and keeping her hopes up like this!" Gu Qingyu said, staring at Qi Wan with contempt.</p>
 <p>"Boss, what are you talking about?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah," The contempt in her eyes changed to care. "It's not that I want to intervene. But there is a limit. If you grind away all of her patience, then you're really a goner!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan could barely keep up with her argument. "Not like this! Boss, I can explain!"</p>
 <p>"Well, go ahead, I'm listening." Gu Qingyu waited.</p>
 <p>"No, I think it's better if I don't say it." Qi Wan swallowed his words. "I will talk to her when I have time."</p>
 <p>"That's good to hear!" Gu Qingyu gave his shoulder a bro-like smack.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Ye Jin showed up when she got back to Xiao Qi's room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I just got back, Xiao Yu'er. Did you miss me?" Ye Jin gave a devilish smile.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu pouted. "Yes." She was just trying to bluff him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yet, Ye Jin smiled gleefully at her response. "I miss you too!"</p>
 <p>Lighting and Thunder, who stood at the side, watched Ye Jin incredulously. <em>The leader smiled? And he smiled so gleefully? And he even said something so goosebump-inducing?</em></p>
 <p>"The Spider Queen is dead..." Gu Qingyu frowned. "You..."</p>
 <p>"I already know who did it." Ye Jin came over and rested his hand on her head. "Why, Xiao Yu'er wants to know?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was shocked. "You know? Who is it?"</p>
 <p>"Well, I think Xiao Yu'er will find out very soon." Ye Jin raised his eyebrows. "Are you scared, Xiao Yu'er?"</p>
 <p>"No," Gu Qingyu stuck out her tongue. "It's okay." <em>It’s not that I never watched a horror movie, but the real version is still a bit intense.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, there are a lot of interesting places in this place." Ye Jin seemed to be in a good mood. "You can let Crow show you around, and if you want, he can teach you more about combat."</p>
 <p>"Eh? Is that okay?" That piqued her interest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Crow replied humbly. "I am not good at teaching."</p>
 <p>"Uncle Crow, then spar with me when you are free!" Gu Qingyu looked excited.</p>
 <p>"Whenever you want, Miss Gu. I will make time." Crow raised his head.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin stroked her head again."I haven't finished my business yet, so Crow will keep you company. You can also play with Lighting and Thunder. Crow, Lighting and Thunder, take care of the madame."</p>
 <p>"Yes, sir!" Crow, Lighting and Thunder immediately stood ramrod straight and answered with a loud yell. <em>You don't have to be so serious! Really!</em></p>
