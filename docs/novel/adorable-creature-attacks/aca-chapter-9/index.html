 <p><span style>“Am I not allowed to be here?” replied Jia Qizhe and chuckled. “Well, I wanted to have a last look at the scenery as we’re leaving tonight...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu walked up to his side, watching the sunlight shimmer, reflecting on the pond. “I think this is for the best...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you ever study medical arts?” asked Jia Qizhe suddenly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded blankly. “Juuuust... A liiiiittle...” She held up her thumb and index finger to show him just how little.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you guarantee to cure his mentor?” he asked again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... No,” Gu Qingyu replied. “I don’t trust my medical skills. But if it’s about mental illness, then I do have a couple tricks up my sleeve.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mental illness?” Jia Qizhe said in mock surprise, “You can cure mental illnesses?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I guess.” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whatever people think, I am still a licensed psychologist in the 21st century!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them stayed and chit chatted for a while longer, then bid a temporary farewell and returned to their rooms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Night fell.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Wearing the black nightsuits they prepared earlier today, Gu Qingyu and Xiao Qi sneaked out of their rooms, and headed towards the crooked tree. Not a single person in the manor noticed their disappearance thanks to Xiao Qi’s minor concealment magic, which helped to cover up any trails and their whereabouts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After much difficulties and with the help of Gu Qingyu’s enhanced senses, the two of them managed to avoid a group of guards, then safely reached their agreed point of rendezvous. Jia Qizhe and Qi Yichen seemed to have been waiting for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is?” Qi Yichen looked at Xiao Qi curiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, right! This is my friend, she will be joining us on our journey! If you so much would allow it, Qi Yichen?” Gu Qingyu looked at him nervously. She had completely forgotten to ask for his approval first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen nodded, “I suppose it’s fine if she’s your friend, Qingyu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She’d told Qi Yichen that Xiao Qi was her friend instead of her servant. After all, it was the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they were both leaving together, Xiao Qi and her master-servant relationship would be no more. Gu Qingyu believed all beings were to be treated equally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi gave Gu Qingyu a grateful look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen smiled and said, “Let’s get moving.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Mm,” Gu Qingyu nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They jumped up the wall quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the other side, around Gu Qingyu’s quarter, the second miss came walking. She walked across the courtyard and stood outside Gu Qingyu’s room, seemingly surveying the area. Gu Qingyu’d left a candle burning in her room so that no one would suspect her missing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A moment later, the second miss opened a window and climbed in through the opening. She walked silently towards Gu Qingyu’s bed, holding the dagger she’d brought out from her sleeve. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She stabbed the bed several times before she realized it was empty. Her heart raised as she pulled back the sheet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She carefully put back the dagger into her sleeve and sorted her clothes. She readied herself and burst out of Gu Qingyu’s room, flailing her hands in front, feigning panic as she screamed loudly, “Someone! Help! Third sister is missing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the escapees happened to witness the whole scene while standing on the high wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu let out a sigh of relief. “Oh my god. Thank goodness we decided to leave tonight... Otherwise, I’m afraid that I would’ve been lying there, covered in blood, unknowing..."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen gave Gu Qingyu a concerned look. He thought she would feel uncomfortable having seen such an unpleasant scene. But in reality, it was the complete opposite————</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Finally yes! Finally now! Finally, freedom!” Gu Qingyu cheered as she jumped off the wall. “Faster! Hurry up!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Qi Yichen stared at her speechlessly for a second, then jumped down. Xiao Qi and Jia Qizhe followed after.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long, the footsteps of guards could be heard from the other side of the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has anyone seen the third miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know! Spread out and search!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The general will kill us if we can’t find her!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu felt a swell of sympathy for them. She hesitated but ultimately decided to leave with the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>They arrived at an inn on the outskirts of the city.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Waiter,” shouted Gu Qingyu as the four of them entered the inn, looking all worn-out. They picked a table and sat down. Gu Qingyu imitated the way of speaking of those in Wuxia and Martial Arts dramas, “Ehem, four-... I mean, two rooms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She brought some silver money from home, but it wasn’t much. So she planned to not spend too lavishly and decided on two rooms instead. “Oh, and bring us some food.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Coming!” The inn waiter seemed very enthusiastic and returned a short time later with a bowl of hot, steaming buns and several plates of side dishes. “Honored guests, please enjoy! We have also prepared the rooms for you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for your trouble,” said Jia Qizhe in an indifferent tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone ate and drank as much as they wanted until they were full and satisfied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I thought if I shared a room with Xiao and you two one, we could save up on some money.” Gu Qingyu rubbed the back of her neck awkwardly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Both of them nodded but didn’t comment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, the four of them decided to call it a night and headed off to find their respective rooms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu blew out the light and laid on the bed next to Xiao Qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was late but she couldn’t sleep. She blinked as she looked around the dark room for a while. Until she couldn't help but whisper, “</span><i><span style>Are you asleep, Xiao Qi?</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Not yet, Mistress...</span></i><span style>” Xiao Qi’s crispy voice was very warm and pleasant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop calling me Mistress, just call me Xiao Yu!” Gu Qingyu laughed. “We’re friends you know!” She thought for a moment, and then asked, “Xiao Qi, what is your name?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao... Xiao Yu. My family name is Xun, so my full name is Xun Qi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, what a pretty name!” Gu Qingyu felt truly happy. She had made her first friend in this foreign world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm...” Xiao Qi laughed softly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a swift shadow darted past the window.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It quickly caught Gu Qingyu’s attention as she was staring out the window, in addition to her enhanced night vision. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu QIngyu immediately got up from the bed and pulled on her clothes and shoes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Xiao Qi stared at Gu Qingyu bewildered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think someone entered Jia Qizhe’s room!” Gu Qingyu finished putting on her shoes and pulled Xiao Qi over against the wall. They put their ears hard against the wall and tried to listen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi was unable to hear anything as the soundproofing in the inn was pretty good. Gu Qingyu, on the other hand, was able to faintly distinguish the sounds... there were sounds of fighting!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu turned and looked at Xiao Qi, “You stay here. I’ll go and assist them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s happening?” asked Xiao Qi panicky since she wasn’t able to hear anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just wait for me,” Gu Qingyu left the room in a hurry. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Without hesitation, she kicked open the door to Jia QIzhe’s room with her foot, storming in and yelling, “QIZHE, YICHEN, I’M HERE TO SAVE——”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>————yoooou~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Her voice cracked on the last when she saw the black-clothed person lying on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I must be out of my mind, why did I even rush here for! How could I forget their backgrounds?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen looked at her and smiled. “You arrived... just a bit too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and felt like a complete fool. “What happened? Someone tried to kill you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as Jia Qizhe opened his mouth, the black-clothed person got up from the floor and thrust his dagger towards Gu Qingyu!!</span></p>
