 <p><strong>Chapter 6: Preparing for the competition</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu wanted to slap Jia Qizhe. &nbsp;She truly did. She wanted to just go to his room and slap him so hard it would send him flying through the roof. So hard he wouldn't even be able to pull himself out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, thinking back what to what happened at the Illusory Cliffs, she decided ultimately to just quietly leave for practice...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>So many annoying and bothersome chores to do, one after another... Sigh~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she arrived at the Zither Hall she saw one of her elder sisters sitting there practising her zither.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman noticed Gu Qingyu and gave a faint smile. “Oh? I do know you were interested in martial arts, though it never occurred to me that you would also be interested in the other arts...” She looked back down at the strings and continued, “But you shouldn’t overreach yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu returned her smile. “Rest assured, sister! I’ll only do what’s within my abilities to do...” She paused. “... Hmm, if I utilize my talents and skills, I think getting first place wouldn’t be a problem! You must come and see my performance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman was slightly taken aback by Gu Qingyu’s reply. She looked as if she hadn’t even expected Gu Qingyu to reply, but she quickly regained her composure. “Worry not. Your sister, I, will definitely be there to see how exactly you plan to win and seize the championship.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu smiled proudly. “I shall give you my thanks first then!” she said and walked further into the hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her only focus was to create a perfect performance for the competition tomorrow.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Seize the championship and escape from this rancorous place!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>The afternoon sun shone lazily over the trees as the light illuminated through the foliage onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu sat in alone in the pavilion, staring gloomily into the emerald-green and crystalline water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The lotus flowers stood tall and beautiful, while the lotus leaves swayed gently in the autumn breeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything in this scenery was delightful to one’s eyes and gladdening to the heart, but her mood was still as depressed and showed no signs of improvement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What should I perform... Haaaaa~~” Another deep sigh escaped Gu Qingyu’s ample lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mistress,” Xiao Qi called out as she brought over a bowl of fruit. “I brought some fresh fruit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You eat, Xiao Qi. I don’t have much of an appetite...” Gu Qingyu sighed for the umpteenth time. “It wouldn't be this hard if we were in the modern world...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mistress, what kind of world is ‘modern’?” Xiao Qi looked at her curiously. “Mistress, you should eat more fruit!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu’s eyes suddenly flashed. “What did you just say?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi guilelessly repeated what she just said, “You should eat more fruit——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu shook her head. “Nonono! What you said earlier!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I brought some &nbsp;fresh fruit?” Xiao Qi tried again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Next sentence!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What kind of world is ‘modern’?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t know right?” Gu Qingyu’s face beamed with joy as she clapped her hands together. “Thank you, Xiao Qi! I finally know what I’m going to do now!” Before Xiao Qi could say any more, Gu Qingyu was already gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi could only follow her to her room. “Mistress?” There was no reply. She stood out there just staring at Gu Qingyu’s closed door. “Your fruit...” Finally, she gave up and ate the fruit by herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Next day.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu bounced cheerfully out of her room early in the morning. The competition was just in a few hours, so she decided to take a walk in the courtyard, to relax and loosen up the tension that’d built up over the past few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She walked leisurely in the garden, enjoying the early morning sun as she moved towards her favourite pavilion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the pavilion, she saw a person standing there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dressed in a long blue robe, a young man stood there, his back turned to her, as he gazed out across the pond. His long black hair flew gracefully over his shoulders as the wind teased his hair, sending it fluttering about his robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taciturn and aloof, devilishly handsome.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stood still for a moment, thinking, then decided to join him. She walked up quietly behind him, trying to sneak up and ‘surprise’ him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oi.” The young man turned around. “What are you doing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guuu... This is awkward!” Her hands hung awkwardly in the air. She swiftly withdrew her hands as if nothing ever happened and quickly changed the topic, “</span><i><span style>Cough, cough!</span></i><span style> I just came to ask you if you are all packed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Packed for what?” Jia Qizhe looked rather confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For when we’re leaving!” said Gu Qingyu assertively.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled at her and said, “Let’s talk about this later when the results are out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu returned his smile. “Just you wait then!” Having said this, she turned and tossed her head to flick her hair back over her shoulder as she strutted away, hips swaying back and fro, leaving Jia Qizhe alone in the pavilion with a speechless face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>The Performing Arts and Craftsmanship Competition.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu arrived at the venue where the competition was being held. “Ooooh~ It’s quite lively~” She looked around at the crowd and exclaimed, “This is great! What a grand event! But who could have so much time and money and nothing better to do but to hold such an event...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whoever it is, I greatly thank that person for arranging this competition! If it weren’t for this, Jia Qizhe wouldn’t have given me another chance, right?</span></i><i></i><i><span style>Both the Illusory Spiritgrass and the bat demon were completely destroyed last time... I’m sure he won’t go so easily back on his words if it’s all fair and square this time.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I cannot agree with you, miss!” She heard an upset boyish voice say. It was a young boy who was dressed like those who maintained order in the venue. “This competition is organized every year by our young master! Unlike other competitions, this is not one of beauty, but one where young women can showcase their true abilities. And each year, the prizes are all prepared by our house. The winners may freely choose between an exquisite musical instrument or three favours of choice. Not only that, but this stage is also a means for all the literarily and artistically talented young women to shine. How can you say that we’re only doing this for we have nothing better to do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything he said was well founded, and Gu Qingyu likewise acknowledged it all. She bowed deeply in a gesture of profound humility. “Pardon me, it was a thoughtless thing to say. I shouldn’t have ridiculed your noble household.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The boy didn’t try to argue anymore when he looked her in the face and saw her sincerity. “It is of no matter, miss. What you said about our house, you have apologized for. Our young master has always been good-natured and kind, so I’m sure he won’t pursue the matter either. However, I do suggest you be careful with your words in the future,” he reminded her again in a gentle but firm manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m most grateful!” Gu Qingyu bowed once more.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t mention it,” said the boy and walked away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu gazed at the young boy as he walked away and rubbed her chin in deep contemplation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm, this highly distinguished young master of his must be an extraordinary individual. One of his lackeys is already such a great speaker, wouldn’t the case usually be so that the person, himself, is even more amazing?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Sigh, why do I care? It has nothing to do with me anyways!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu swung her sleeve, turned around, and walked to a vacant place to sit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The competition was about to start.</span></p>
