<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The Soul Chain danced around Gu Qingyu, she was not having any trouble with the new wave of assassins, but they felt stronger than the previous wave. She turned around and saw that two assassins had flanked Qi Yichen and Xiao Qi, and Qi Yichen and Xiao Qi were clearly struggling. Her eyes turned chilling cold and she threw the burning-hot Soul Nails at the assassins without hesitation. A black hexagram appeared at the feet of the two assassins, a large hand crawled out from the hexagram and dragged the man in black straight down to hell.</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen widened his eyes in shock and took a step back. He followed where the Soul Nails came from and stared at Gu Qingyu. But Gu Qingyu did not have time to dwell on his reaction and continued her fight against the assassins. Now, they could go toe-to-toe against her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, the earth trembled and Gu Qingyu flinched. All of the assassins had retreated into the shadows.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What's going on?" Gu Qingyu frowned as she scanned the surroundings.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"We probably have a nasty one joining us." Jia Qizhe slightly squinted as he tried to make out the thing approaching them in the woods.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu looked in his direction.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>A giant demon slowly emerged from the shadows. It towered over them and blocked out the sky. The team was engulfed by darkness. It seemed that there was a person standing on the demon's shoulder. Because of the backlighting, the silhouette was not clear. But based on the physique, it should be a woman. Gu Qingyu raised her arm and was about to start fighting again, but Jia Qizhe stopped her. "Why, what is the big fuss that even the Spider Queen would show up in person?"</p>
 <p>The woman replied in a sweet voice. "As expected from the great Hero Jia, such good eyesight. But, the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny, that should warrant a big fuss, no?" &nbsp;As soon as she finished her sentence, Gu Qingyu was certain that they had been following them for a long time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But...Spider Queen? Judging from Jia Qizhe's tone, it should be very powerful, right?</em></p>
 <p>"For the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny alone?" Before Jia Qizhe could reply, Murong Zuoyu's cold voice came. "Is that all that you are after?"</p>
 <p>When the woman heard his question, she giggled and replied,. "Yeah, in addition to the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny, the Spirit Gems are also coveted treasures, not to mention, three of them. Wouldn't you agree, Duke Murong?" Gu Qingyu was taken aback by that response, she did not expect that woman to have such detailed intel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Spider Queen, I always thought you were a smart person." Jia Qizhe narrowed his eyes slightly.</p>
 <p>"What a shame, I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you, Jia Qizhe." The Spider Queen jumped from the giant demon and landed steadily. Her eyes looked at Gu Qingyu enchantingly, "Young lady, hand over the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny and I will spare all of you. What do you think? "</p>
 <p>"You sound quite confident." Gu Qingyu forced her lips into a grin. "Why, are you all ready?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, I believe." The Spider Queen tucked her bangs behind her ear teasingly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan hmphed. "Auntie, you look so ugly."</p>
 <p>"You..." The Spider Queen frowned, but the frown quickly morphed into a smile. "My beauty has nothing to do with you lot, because you all can't live past today."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The battle began at the end of her sentence. The giant demon roared and stormed towards the team. "Be careful, Xiao Yu'er." Blue light overflowed from Jia Qizhe's hand. "This guy is a little dangerous."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu nodded and gripped the chain in her hands. The chain shone coldly under the sunlight. "Qi Wan, protect Qi Yichen and Xiao Qi."</p>
 <p>"Yes, my lord!" Qi Wan immediately retreated to Qi Yichen's side. Qi Yichen didn't voice any objections.</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu sliced open his palm with his sword, blood spattered. As the sword turned red, he raised the blade and flew to Warcraft.</p>
 <p>"Be careful!" Gu Qingyu screamed a warning as she controlled the chains and shielded Murong Zuoyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai glanced at the Spider Queen and the jade flute in his hand quickly flew from his hand, aiming at her vitals. She jumped up and flipped in mid-air. The jade flute narrowly missed her, it chopped off the tree behind her instead. She stared at Mo Bai and revealed a charming smile. "Why should the Divine Doctor intervene? I can still let you go, if you would choose to use your divine healing on another. "</p>
 <p>"No need." Mo Bai pursed his lips, held out his hand, and caught the jade flute. That move was just to test her capabilities. He had already detected her unusual powers from that short exchange.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><em>Roar!&nbsp;</em>The giant demon roared and slapped Murong Zuoyu. Gu Qingyu's chain immediately wrapped around Murong Zuoyu's waist and yanked him out of the way. His sword sliced through the air and left a cut on the demon’s palm. Green-coloured blood scattered through the air, it sizzled against the chain. The Soul Chain was corroded! She immediately looked up and checked Murong Zuoyu. Although he had shielded himself with the aura from his sword, he was still hit by the acid blood. Several spots on his body sizzled and tiny wisps of smoke appeared. He merely grunted in response. She immediately pulled him back, but the Spider Queen extended her hand, and Gu Qingyu's body stopped against her will.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Spider silk." Qi Wan's eyes turned cold and the ribbon in his hand flew out. He flashed and came behind the Spider Queen. The Spider Queen seemed to have expected it and whipped around. One of her hands was fixed, and the other hand was turned rapidly. Under the sunlight, Gu Qingyu could see a net falling towards Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan!" Gu Qingyu said in surprise, Jia Qizhe also quickly turned the sword in his hand and sliced the air, then flew to the Spider Queen. Whatever that bound Gu Qingyu was gone, she immediately pulled the chain and forced Murong Zuoyu, who had been struggling with the monster, to regroup. Murong Zuoyu knelt on the ground as soon as he landed. Blood bubbled from his lips, and his sword was battered and chipped, corroded by the acid. Mo Bai noticed him and rushed over to heal him. However, the monster did not intend to give them such a chance. It roared and flew towards Qi Yichen and Xiao Qi.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu wanted to use the Soul Nails again, but Mo Bai grabbed her hand and stopped her. "I'll go." His white wings spread open, and the jade flute in his hand shone with a pale green light.</p>
 <p>"Right." Gu Qingyu immediately leaned down, "Brother Murong, are you ok? Take a breather." Murong Zuoyu met her eyes and did not speak. There was still a fire in his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>At this moment, from the corner of her eye, Gu Qingyu spotted the assassins. They were on the move again! At the same time, Jia Qizhe quickly returned to Gu Qingyu's side, he was holding onto Qi Wan, who was bleeding from his shoulder and legs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Why? How did this happen?" Gu Qingyu frowned, looking up at the Spider Queen, she was still smiling, with no trace of injury.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The assassins came like a tide, and Gu Qingyu immediately brought Qi Wan and Murong Zuoyu to a spot. The chains on her hands came to life and surrounded them. Mo Bai's jade flute pierced through the giant demon, right through its chest. Blood spewed and gushed from the demon. The fan in Qi Yichen's hands immediately spun rapidly to shield against the acid blood, but it was eroding Qi Yichen's shield! Blood trickled from his lips, but Qi Yichen gritted his teeth and held up the shield. The monster roared and finally, slowly collapsed. Qi Yichen sighed with relief, and suddenly a sharp blade penetrated his shield and pierced his shoulder!</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi immediately stepped forward and sent out a ball of magic, but the assassin flashed lightly and easily avoided it. Mo Bai's eyes sank, the jade flute in his hand flew out and right through the assassin. Before the Jade Flute flew back, the assassin grabbed the Jade Flute with one hand, and then fell to the ground. Mo Bai frowned quietly. As more assassins flew towards him, he waved his sleeve and blades of leaves appeared in his hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Hang in there!" Gu Qingyu's voice was hoarse, and she gritted her teeth. She and Jia Qizhe were separated from the rest of the team by the assassins. However, there was no response from that direction, only the sound of mutilated flesh. The Spider Queen walked towards Gu Qingyu elegantly. Gu Qingyu could tell that things were about to get worse and suddenly remembered the pill that Yan Zun gave her before he fell asleep. No longer hesitating, she took out the pill from her sleeve. The Spider Queen had noticed that she was up to something. With a wave of her hand, Gu Qingyu's hand was released uncontrollably, and the pill was thrown to the ground. The Spider Queen walked over and stepped on the pill. She ground her heel into the ground as she sneered, "Don't bother, you will never win."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe snorted coldly, the sword in his hand flew out, and blocked the Spider Queen's path. "If you take another step forward, I will not be polite."</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen remained in her spot, she giggled instead. &nbsp;"Hero Jia, why? Why go to such lengths?"</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe didn't speak, he pulled Gu Qingyu into his arms and glared at the Spider Queen with furrowed brows. Gu Qingyu looked at the Spider Queen's feet. The pill had been ground to a powder.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Go." The spider lady tilted her head, and the assassins immediately swarmed them.</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe gritted his teeth, and the sword flew back into his hand. He stood in front of Gu Qingyu and fought the assassins. They could not even get close to Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was about to join in the fight, but Jia Qizhe stopped her. "Xiao Yu'er, just stay behind me."</p>
 <p>"You..." Gu Qingyu frowned, looked back at Murong Zuoyu and Qi Wan, both of them had lost consciousness. After clenching her teeth, the chain in her hands rattled and it circled around the assassins and attacked the Spider Queen.</p>
 <p>The Spider Queen seemed to have expected that she would do this. She smiled slightly and squinted her eyes, her long fingers interlaced. A spider web blocked Gu Qingyu's attack, then the silk turned into swords and flew towards Gu Qingyu. Gu Qingyu was shocked and closed her eyes.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The squelching of pierced flesh came and something sticky splashed on her face.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu opened her eyes. Someone stood in front of her and shielded her with his body. Blood was splattered all over his pristine blue robes. Jia Qizhe stood in front of her.</p>
 <p>"Jia... Jia Qizhe..." Gu Qingyu's pupils shrank from horror, and at the same time, the giant demon who had fallen to the ground actually stood up!</p>
 <p>It was as though her heart was hollowed out, she stood there staring blankly, as Jia Qizhe collapsed before her. Her eyes were dry, there were no tears.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Why would you feel sad, if you had lost your heart itself?</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>She suddenly saw something floating in the air. Those crystal-like things turned into a pool of water, and Gu Qingyu couldn't help but stretched out her hand to catch it. Those crystals things continued to fly up from the ground near the Spider Queen's feet. <em>It was... the pill?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu no longer hesitated and poured the liquid into her mouth. The moment the liquid trickled down her throat, her head was going to split apart, and her body was tearing and twisting. Pain was on her skin, in her bones, racing through her blood. Gu Qingyu closed her eyes and covered her head, her body felt as though it was going to explode. The pain erupted, and in a moment, the air stilled. The only thing she heard was the pounding in her ears.</p>
 <p><em>Boom! Bang!&nbsp;</em>A surge of energy swelled from within and burst through her.</p>
 <p>In the chaos, the giant demon smacked towards the unconscious Jia Qizhe. The tips of the Spider Queen's lips were slightly raised, showing a triumphant smile. Gu Qingyu couldn't care so much, and immediately stood in front of Jia Qizhe! Dust swept up into the sky.</p>
 <p><em>Boom!</em></p>

 <p>Brb, just gonna cry for a while now. The way Jia Qizhe shielded Gu Qingyu with his body reminded me of a scene in Bleach. Also, I’ve found a pretty apt song for this pairing, “Kiss of Death” by Mika Nakashima, there is also an English cover by Amalee/LeeandLie on YouTube. Let me know what you think, and stay tuned for the next chapter! </p>
