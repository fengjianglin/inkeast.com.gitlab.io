 <p><b>Back at the inn.</b></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as Gu Qingyu entered the inn, she spotted everyone else already seated around a large table filled with all kinds of food.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ehh?” She let out a surprised gasp. “Everything is ordered and served already?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Just missing you,” said Murong Zuoyu coldly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh?” She joined them at the table. “How come you’re back so early?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because our tasks were easy~” Qi Yichen grinned. “Since Qingyu has arrived, let’s dig in~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu scratched her head awkwardly, “I... </span><i><span style>Burp!</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you unwell, brother Zhu?” Mo Bai looked at her worriedly. “Is everything fine? Why would you suddenly burp as soon as you sit down?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...” She rubbed her head.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What am I supposed to say? That I can’t eat anymore because I already had four meat buns? </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ha-ha~ I’m not... feeling well! Yeah, I don’t feel well! I think I’ll go upstairs and rest first.” She could hardly believe her own fabrication.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You mean... you’re not eating?” He became even more worried. “Why don’t you eat a little before you go upstairs?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head fiercely, “No, it’s fine. Thank you, Mo Bai!” Having said that, she immediately flew up from the table and disappeared upstairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It sucked. Lying to him. She hated it. It felt like a crime, a sin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Creak——” </span></p>
 <p><span style>The door slowly opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned her head towards the sound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Bai?” Gu Qingyu immediately sat up on the bed. “Why are you here and not eating?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry for barging in so suddenly,” he said and gave her an apologetic face. “I tried knocking, but you weren’t responding, so I became worried...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, I don’t mind.” She looked up at him, “Is there anything you need?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai placed a small basket on the table and then put his hand in his sleeve and took out a bundle of herbs, “Miss Gu, you may eat these by itself, it’ll help you with digestion... Also, I brought up some rice and a couple of side dishes, in case you feel hungry later.” He pointed at the basket on the table.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ah... he already knew...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai addressed her as Miss Gu when there was no one else around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you.” She knew that she couldn’t hide it from him and got up from the bed to walk to the table. “No one knows me as well as you, Mo Bai~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re welcome.” He bowed his head to her. “Then, I’ll let you rest?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“‘Kay!” She nodded back at him. “Byebye!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Byebye!” He smiled and closed the door carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tee-hee~” Gu Qingyu sat down in the chair. She put some of the herbs in her mouth as she happily opened the basket. She had to admit that she was a foodie.</span></p>
 <p><span style>T/N: Cough, glutton.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Knock, knock.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone knocked on the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in.” She took another spoonful, “Mhm, ‘tis so good!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Zuoyu walked in and saw her eating. “Eh... are you stuffing yourself until your burst?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“S’pose.” She didn’t feel like talking to him, so she continued to eat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Zuoyu didn’t anything either, but he continued to stare at her with an intensity that made her break out in a cold sweat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Err... why don’t you join me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfft!” Murong Zuoyu actually laughed. “I am not a pig.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the... Did he just indirectly call me a pig? He actually told a girl directly to her face that she’s a pig??</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm... I don’t think he knows that I’m a girl... but still, what kind of person does that?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, I am a pig.” She looked at him unhappily, “Happy now?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whatever, I’m just gonna pretend he’s not here.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Murong Zuoyu stood leaning against the wall, continuing to stare at her without uttering a single word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” She gave him a baffled look, then continued to ignore him and ate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a while, Gu Qingyu was totally full and couldn’t eat anymore.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As expected, my condition is not the same after eating four meat buns...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She looked up and saw that Murong Zuoyu was still staring at her with half-smiling lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you want?” She began to get an uneasy feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He started walking closer...</span></p>
 <p><span style>She felt a strong gust of wind swirl around her. She tried to get up, but the wind was suppressing her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Zuoyu looked at her closely, as if he was enjoying the bewildered expression on her face. Then, he just taciturnly said, “You have some rice around your lips.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Gosh! So now I’m a fool!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu turned her head away angrily and wiped her mouth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She could feel it. How powerful he was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Were you scared by This Prince?” He narrowed his eyes as he smirked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She raised one of her eyes brows and said noncommittally, “Maybe.” Without waiting for a reply, Gu Qingyu continued, “Also, could you stop speaking in third person? The commoners will get intimidated by you if they hear the way you talk!” Gu Qingyu tried to divert their argument by changing the topic to his people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s with that?” Murong Zuoyu was successfully diverted by her. “This Prince visits the people of this country regularly, so the people are in fact quite warmly inclined towards This Prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A mean and cold prince like you? she replied sarcastically.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He furrowed his brows. “You——” Suddenly he stopped and went quiet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you two talking about?”</span></p>
