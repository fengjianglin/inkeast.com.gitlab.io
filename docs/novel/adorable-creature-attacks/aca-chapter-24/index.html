 <p><span style>Murong Zuoyu appeared in front of them. “I told you it wouldn’t be that easy.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why can’t you just let us leave in peace?” Gu Qingyu couldn’t keep it in anymore, “I mean, forget about the plant, but you’re not even letting us leave now? Yo, don’t think we’re afraid of you just because you’re a prince!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You carry the Jewel of Desired Fate,” Murong Zuoyu looked at her with hard, cold eyes. Still, she saw greed flashing in his eyes. “Hand it over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah??” Gu Qingyu looked at him strangely, “Jewel of Desired Fate? You’re after the Blood Jade too?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Then again, who wouldn’t want to take hold of a priceless treasure waving before one’s eyes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah,” he said noncommittally.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then they heard the voices and footsteps of guards in the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think they went this way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“C’mon, move faster!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let them get away!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stamped her foot in frustration, “Would you ask for something else? Anything but the Jewel.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they were to get caught now, not only would she be recognized, but they’d also implicate the other three members.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go with you,” said Murong Zuoyu after thinking carefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” Gu Qingyu stared at him with big eyes. “This is not the time to be joking around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m serious.” Murong Zuoyu tilted his head and looked at her, “After thinking carefully, I recalled that the Jewel of Desired Fate chooses its master, so I won’t be able to take it forcibly from you. Instead, I want to join you. Why? I can’t?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, no, no. Of course, you can! Why don’t we leave immediately?” she asked hopefully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure.” Murong Zuoyu nodded faintly.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a refreshing answer! I’ve been waiting for it for age! Pity me for worrying about getting caught!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Following Murong Zuoyu’s lead, the three of them left the palace very quickly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi, Qi Yichen and Mo Bai had been waiting for them for a while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw Murong Zuoyu walking beside Gu Qingyu, the three mouths dropped open at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Would you introduce us?” Mo Bai looked at Gu Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu explained indignantly, “He’s the one and only, Murong Zuoyu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Murong Zuoyu?” Qi Yichen erased first the five words she said. “Why is he with you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I wonder.” Gu Qingyu felt helpless. “Let’s go back to the inn first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.” Qi Yichen nodded, and glanced at Murong Zuoyu once, but didn’t say anything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Murong Zuoyu joining in as the newest member of the party, the trip back went very smooth, and they arrived safely at the inn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So tell us, what’s going on?” Qi Yichen seemed very curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He——” Gu Qingyu got interrupted just as she tried to explain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to protect the Jewel of Desired fate. And...” Murong Zuoyu glared at Gu Qingyu, “... the master of the Blood Jade has given his consent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Am I right?” Murong Zuoyu looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm-hmm... yes.” In tearless grief, Gu Qingyu continued, “I have a name, so please stop addressing me with embarrassing titles in the future. My name is... Zhu Fan.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, Zhu Fan,” he said her name again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But... are you certain you’d be willing to let go of everything? To go on a long journey with us? I mean, you’re a Grand Prince! Say, you might even become the next emperor,” asked Gu Qingyu cautiously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Zuoyu nodded, “Why not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As you wish. I hope you have a great time with us...” Gu Qingyu stood up weakly, “I think I’m going to bed now. Good night, everyone...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Zhu, are you feel unwell?” Mo Bai seemed worried. “Would you like me to have a look at your pulse? You might be sick.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s fine. I’m just tired. Xiao Qi, let’s return to our room...” Gu Qingyu pulled up Xiao Qi and left for the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She heard Murong Zuoyu’s surly voice behind her, “You two... sleep together?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is. There. A. Problem?” Her words rang in his ears. She turned around slowly and glared at him, her face dark and sinister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Zuoyu, “...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The look in Gu Qingyu’s eyes was just as cold as her words, sending shivers down Xiao Qi’s spine. “Xi-Xiao Fan, c’mon. Let’s go upstairs.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi started dragging Gu Qingyu away from the others, and they disappeared up the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone else watched as Gu Qingyu was dragged away pitifully by Xiao Qi, but at the same time, they felt relieved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once the two girls were gone, Jia Qizhe looked at Murong Zuoyu coolly, “Why are you even here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m here to make sure the Blood Jade doesn’t end up in the wrong hands,” replied Murong Zuoyu coolly back. “I believe I was born with only one purpose in life, and that is to serve as the guardian of the Jewel of Desired Fate. Which also includes me watching over its current master, Zhu Fan, to make sure he isn’t someone with an impure, corrupt heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would you do if that’s the case?” asked Qi Yichen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll kill him,” replied Murong Zuoyu softly, without a trace of fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And I’ll kill you</span><i><span style> before </span></i><span style>you do that.” Mo Bai blew softly into his cup and sipped at the tea.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Did Mo Bai just say what I think he said?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe and Qi Yichen stared at him flabbergasted. It wasn’t something this gentle and docile man would normally say. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just try me,” said Murong Zuoyu coldly, and with that, he left the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai was leisurely sipping his second cup of tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Nobody spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Upstairs.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi tried to calm Gu Qingyu down when they returned to their room, but Gu Qingyu was still angry with the whole ordeal when she went to bed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Really, Murong Zuoyu actually followed us back to the inn!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You looked like something bad happened.” Gu Qingyu looked up and noticed that she had unconsciously entered her own mental world again. Venerable Flame was still half lying on the bed like last time. “What is the matter? Was the spell I taught you insufficient? Did you fail?”</span><span style>“Not really...” Gu Qingyu put her head down on her knees, dispirited. “Murong Zuoyu decided to come with us, and he said something about protecting the Blood Jade...”</span></p>
