 <p></p>
 <p><span style>When Gu Qingyu saw the long white robe, she thought Mo Bai came back again at first before Qi Yichen peeked his head through the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nothing.” Murong Zuoyu slightly lowered his eyes and walked out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen gave him a curious look before he walked into the room. “Brother Zhu, aren’t you cold?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu, still in a daze, shook her head slowly. “... Why would I be?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He walked closer to the table and said softly, “You know when the prince walked past me? Yeah, it felt like frozen wind slapped me in the face. It's even colder here inside...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, Gu Qingyu regained her senses. She looked at him and smiled. “Oh, really? I don’t feel cold——” She stopped and then narrowed her eyes at him. “Hmm, why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen glanced at the leftovers on the table. “I went out to get some bread for you because I thought you didn’t have any appetite...” He held up a bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! Thanks a lot!” She grabbed the bag from him, “I don’t mind eating a bit more!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t resist adding, “... Were you a pig in your previous life?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Do you think so too?” She began to nibble on the bread.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Too?” He thought on this a moment, rubbing his chin. “Apart from me, who else could be this smart?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Smart? I’ll admit he’s smart, but he’s also clever.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I were to use modern terms to describe our members then Jia Qizhe would be the guardian, Qi Yichen the strategist, Mo Bai the healer, and since Xiao Qi is good at preparing our equipment and every day works, she would be a supporting type. Murong Zuoyu has his specialities too, he has his privileges and things has gone much smoother ever since he joined us... he could be the diplomat?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>And as for myself... Uh, am I only good for odd jobs?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But&nbsp;</span></i><i><span style>now that I think about it, don’t they always ask for my guidance and point of view nowadays? I might as well be the leader then~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Who else you ask?” Gu Qingyu smiled to herself thinking of her acting as the leader. “Of course it’s Murong Zuoyu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha!” Qi Yichen laughed an easy and carefree laugh. “Since the herb mission seems to be out of the picture, what are we going to do next?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We can just wander around and eat!” she replied excitedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It sounds like you just hit the jackpot.” Qi Yichen rolled his eyes. “The day after tomorrow is the Lantern Festival. So, it might not be impossible for you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>For me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh well, I’m pretty used to these indirect remarks by now.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Nightfall.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu sat on her bed, staring blankly at the empty, hollow room. Finally, she got up and decided to take a walk. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Her stomach grumbled. She hadn’t eaten anything for dinner since she had too much during lunch.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where should I go?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She gazed at the windows with blue curtains in the distance and made her decision. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Knock, knock”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu knocked on the door, “Jia Qizhe... Jia Qizhe, are you there? Jia Qizhe, Jia——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Click.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The door slowly opened by itself. She heard his voice say, “What is it?” His voice sounding very grave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue curtains were drawn back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu walked in cautiously through the dusky light in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jia Qizhe?” She noticed a figure lying in the bed. “Are.. you alright?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who opened the door earlier? Did he use magic? What am I thinking about, it’s not the time for this.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m fine...” His voice sounded very hoarse. “Why are you here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She glanced cautiously at the bed. “I... I wanted to ask you out for a walk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You...” The person on the bed let out a faint sigh. “You should ask Mo Bai.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mo Bai?” She walked closer to the bed. “Jia Qizhe, what’s the matter with you? You are...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>... acting a bit strange.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I said I’m fine.” The person sat up on the bed. “There’s nothing wrong with me, just tired.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tried to look at his face, but it was very blurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All right, I... believe you.” She nodded and slowly walked out again, closing the door gently.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll just go find someone else then.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mo Bai? Qi Yichen? Xiao Qi? Or maybe... Murong Zuoyu?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’ll just go with Mo Bai this time. He’s the one with the sweetest temper, I might have more fun with him~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As she pondered over the matter, she arrived outside Mo Bai’s room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She reached out her hand and was about to knock, but then stopped.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fufufu~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu suddenly felt mischievous.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I could prank him~</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She took out the black mask she’d bought in the morning, put it on, and opened the door quietly. The candle was burning, but she didn’t see anyone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Placing each foot quietly, she sneaked into the room and closed the door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was a sweet and fragrant scent of herbs in the air.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Strange, I don’t see Mo Bai...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, she felt a very strong energy wrapping around her body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu turned her head around abruptly. She felt an icy-cold and sharp object pressing against her neck. “Who?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned her eyes up and saw Mo Bai’s unusually grim face. She immediately pulled off the mask and yelled, “It’s me, Mo Bai!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was slightly surprised when she pulled off the mask. He lowered his hands as a smile slowly crossed his face. “I’m so sorry, Miss Gu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The piercing, cold look he had in his eyes earlier was a total contrast to his usual self.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked at her warmly with his sweet face as he gently touched her neck with his fingers. “Did I hurt you? Does it hurt?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu looked down at his hand and found that he was actually just holding a piece of leaf.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Amazing! I could even feel his killing intent and his force was so powerful!! But... the killing intent vanished as soon as he found out it was me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head and smiled. “It’s nothing. But, why couldn’t I see you earlier?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was just about to change my clothes.” Mo Bai chuckled. “Why are you here so late?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Late?” When he mentioned the time, she noticed that he was only wearing a long white garment. She looked out the window at the sky. It seemed to be around 7 pm. “I don’t think it’s as late as you make it seem... Could you keep me company for a walk? Also, stop calling me Miss Gu——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m sorry. It must’ve been awfully rude of me——” He was quickly interrupted by Gu Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, that’s not what I mean.” She grinned happily at him. “Mo Bai, you’re very kind to me. What I mean is that you can just call me Yu’er when there’s no one around.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yu...” Mo Bai seemed to be blushing. “Yu’er...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stared at him. “Oh right, you never answered me. Do you want to go for a walk with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai nodded his head and gently smiled at her. “As you wish.”</span></p>
