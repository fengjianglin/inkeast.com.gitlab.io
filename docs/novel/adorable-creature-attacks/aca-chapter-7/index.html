 <p><strong>Chapter 7: A breathtaking song</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a crafty woman...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The first contestant to enter the stage was the sister Gu Qingyu met the other day in the Zither Hall.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Though I cannot say that I’m surprised... unless one performed exceptionally well, weren’t the first and the last performers usually the ones that left the deepest impressions on the audience?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu sucked in her cheeks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I must win today. Regardless of what they do, I will seize the championship.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The young woman on stage took her zither, a guzheng, and played upon it so beautiful and sad at the same time. The sad and happy melodies intertwined, telling the thoughts and desired of a young maiden, and stories of the past. A song of faint melancholy, the mood followed its sentiment as a faint mist slowly swirled around the young woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last note rang out for a few seconds as the young woman held down the last string plucked with her finger. Immediately, the audience stood up to applaud and cheer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well done! What a great performance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This should be the Second Young Lady of Gu Family? As expected of their second miss!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone mentioned that their third miss is also going to participate this year!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? I thought she was only interested in martial arts?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“God knows! It does sound quite odd!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s see what she has to offer first!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh, I hope it’s not a swordplay”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hahaha————”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Humph.” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes listlessly at the loud men in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Laugh while you can, bunch of idiots! My performance will blow out your eardrums and blow your minds!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The competition continued, and more contestants performed one after another. But none of them were as good as the second miss, so they only received mediocre reactions from the crowd.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Gu Qingyu’s instincts told her someone was near, and watching her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She turned around, instantly on guard, and looked up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>High above, a tall figure stood alone upon the rooftop. The hem of his blue robe fluttered in the autumn breeze.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Jia Qizhe.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Is he here... to watch my performance?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes met. He smiled at her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Argh, that smug look on his face! He must be here to see how I make a fool outta myself!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I won’t let him! I must not fail! I refuse to become a laughingstock!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She clenched her fist at her sides and glared at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next contestant, a young girl, who wore a long flowy violet dress, carried a pipa up the stage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young girl sat herself down on a chair and set up her instrument. She looked out over the crowd, smiled a charming and lovely smile, and began to softly play a melodious tune on her pipa. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu turned her gaze towards the sound as she was slowly drawn into the enchanting sea of music.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The notes almost seemed to dance in the air as gentle waves of the melody spread among the people. Suddenly, sprinkles of magic glittered in the midst of the pristine and pure sounds.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This young lady is definitely not a common personage.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu merely gave it a slight thought and wasn’t too concerned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Applause roared like thunder when the song reached its end, even more so than the first performance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now it was Gu Qingyu’s turn. She carried a guzheng, the same kind of zither her sister used, as she entered the stage. She took her place and began playing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Using the skills of the previous owner of the body, she plucked the strings, and brought out a soft and smooth melody, soothing the crowd and draining the tension from the previous performances.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that she had everyone’s attention, using her other superior instrument——her voice——she officially began her performance.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Falling peach blossoms drift across the skies♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Smiling over the ever-changing world as they twinkle and dance in a never-ending line♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Oh, how lives of mortals are entwined in their sad and joyous destinies♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Living within the flow, guided by the oblivious fate♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style>Her voice softly trailed off, while letting her slender fingers continue playing. The melody flowed, continuously mesmerizing the crowd. Then she opened her mouth and began again,</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Strangers in this life, though bound by the red string of fate♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Just a single glance♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪The world around them became colourless and quiet as time seemed to freeze♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪The shimmering water reflects the image of the young couple, tenderly embracing their pure and beautiful love♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu smiled as her fingers moved faster and faster across the strings. The song gradually reached its climax.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Engrave the everburning seal of eternal impenitence♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪For naught will change, no matter how many lifetimes pass♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Turning back for a moment, reminiscing the memories♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪In the end, it all melts away, like snowflakes in the sun♪~</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><i><span style>~♪Waking up from the dream of past, present and future, the buried promises bloomed yet again from the depths of their hearts♪~”</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The music ceased and everyone froze in place. Though it was quiet, the sweet and soft melody lingered in everyone’s minds. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The crowd were all stunned, confused and blown away at the same time. It was the first time for everyone to experience this style of music and lyrics.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Fufufu~ As I expected!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu grinned to herself.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Stay amazed everyone!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A few hands started to clap, then as if everyone just woke up from a dream, a thunderous applause began. The crowd roared and cheered, louder and louder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Goodness, this is the Third Young Lady of Gu Family? What graceful demeanour!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree! Who said earlier that she only knows how to fight?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a wonderful song! What a wonderful concept!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu gave a small smile as she dropped into a graceful curtsy. Then she walked slowly off the stage, keeping up her role as a lady of nobility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe’s eyes narrowed in contemplation.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I only thought that she only knew some martial arts... She’s actually quite gifted...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>I suppose I could make an exception this time...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He vanished like a wisp of smoke dispersing in the wind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu looked up to the roof at the exact same time, but she missed him by just a millisecond.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Huh? Where did he go! Did he leave already? How come I never noticed? Don’t tell me he missed my brilliant performance?!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss, I must say that you are very talented,” said a voice behind her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu turned her head around. “Uh? May I ask who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young man stood there with a fan in his hands. He had an otherworldly air. His long elegant white robe made him look as though he was an angel descended from the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This scholar is called Qi Yichen,” he said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A pleasure to meet you, Young Master Qi.” Gu Qingyu gave him a slight curtsy. “What may I do for you, Young Master Qi?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu continued speaking in a formal language because she had to keep up this noble facade of hers while they were still at the event.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After your performance, I couldn’t help but come to praise you in person. Your literary talent is absolutely striking.” He smiled and continued, “I believe there is none other than you to be worthy of receiving the crown this year, miss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You flatter me, Young Master Qi.” Gu Qingyu returned his smile. “There are yet plenty more talented performers than me, Qingyu, to perform.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Qingyu?” Qi Yichen froze still, and then asked, “Does your family name happen to be Gu, miss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded, “Yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen laughed. “Then I have not come in vain. I’m going to be frank with you, Miss Gu. On the orders of my mentor, I have come to find you.”</span></p>
