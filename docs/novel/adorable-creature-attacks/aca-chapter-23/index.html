 <p><strong>Chapter 23: Lost Magic: Ring of Frost (1)</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yes, I am amazing! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Although the plan remained the same, the group obtained an additional trump card, and it was Gu Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the time period when Gu Qingyu fell unconscious, she had entered her own mental world where the young man of the Blood Jade stayed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oi,” Venerable Flame was half lying on a bed, “That person just sprinkled some herbs on you and you fainted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...” Gu Qingyu felt really stupid and ashamed. “My strength is still insufficient, I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, do not be sorry to Me.” Venerable Flame sat up on the bed. “You should feel pity for your companion. You are nothing but a burden, no help at all, while your friend is fighting all alone and defending you in this dangerous place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I...” Gu Qingyu let out a long, silent sigh of misery. Then suddenly, an idea struck her. Her eyes shone as she looked at Venerable Flame, “Oh, right! Weren’t you the ‘Jewel of Desired Fate’? And the self-proclaimed, most powerful Venerable Flame? You must be able to help me out!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What would you like Me to help you with?” Venerable Flame seemed interested and looked at her with his chin resting on his hand. “If it’s too much work, I won’t join you in this mess.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just teach me one of your killer moves!” Even as she said it she got very excited, “I can easily defeat him as long as you teach me one of your skills!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Venerable Flame shook his head, “But he isn’t the only one you’ll have to look out for.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? What do you mean?” She stared at him in bewilderment. She didn’t recall sensing anyone else when she was in that room with Murong Ranyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Venerable Flame’s almond-shaped eyes narrowed at her, “It’s someone far out of your league, girl. You’re no match for him, which is why you couldn’t sense him... Very well, I shall teach you a spell. When you channel this spell, you’ll be able to freeze everything around you within the area of a few meters whether it’s living or an object. However, casting this spell will exhaust your mental energy, magical power, and physical strength. You’d better remember well, and do not disappoint me...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Present.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu and Jia Qizhe walked in the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The floor was covered in a thin crust of ice. The ice let out a crackling sound with every step they took. The sound of ice breaking was very nauseating and ear-piercing, especially so for Gu Qingyu who had sensitive ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Swooosh——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe pulled back the quilt. The bed was empty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Curses.” Jia Qizhe put the dagger back into his sleeve, and instead summoned his usual weapon——the blue sword. “Murong Zuoyu must be nearby.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu noticed that Jia Qizhe changed weapons, so she put her dagger back into her sleeve too, then fiddled around until she took out the dagger again with resignation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Because she didn’t have any other weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“For you.” Jia Qizhe took out an object and nudged it against her arm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh?” Gu Qingyu titled her head with a questioning look as she accepted the item. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is... a wristbow!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you giving me this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s perfect for you as it’s very suitable for cats and their lithe style. Use it for self-defence,” said Jia Qizhe as he swiftly walked out of the room. Gu Qingyu followed quickly behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Move faster! Don’t let them get away!!” A group of guards came running from the western hallway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu quickly averted her face and turned to the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She heard the steps behind her, then one of the guards shouted, “Your Highness!” Her heart skipped a beat.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Murong Zuoyu came back??!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Fear not,” whispered Jia Qizhe softly in her ear. “It seems they mistook you for the prince.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu looked down at herself. She was still wearing the purple robe she put on in the morning because Jia Qizhe insisted on not changing.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that... Murong Zuoyu likes to wear purple coloured clothes?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu put her hand to her throat and coughed lightly, twice, “</span><i><span style>Cough, cough!</span></i><span style> You may leav——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not our prince!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right! Our prince would never cough in front of us!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They must be the intruders!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Catch them!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe grabbed Gu Qingyu’s hand, “Jump”. They leapt up to the roof.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu turned in midair and shot arrows down, taking out several guards, each shot a killing shot.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nice going,” Jia Qizhe said as a smile crept across his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A dim blue circle of light shone around them, and at the next moment, they were in the outer palace close to the large tree.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Teleportation?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just as she relaxed and thought they were safe, she noticed a person standing under the tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His dark hair fluttered slightly in the night breeze. His eyes were closed, his arms crossed over his chest, embracing a sword.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like her, he was also wearing a purple robe.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This should the genuine Murong Zuoyu, right?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But, how did he know we would turn up here?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh! It’s you two.” Murong Zuoyu opened his eyes. “Were you leaving?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu had a bad feeling. “Why... are you trying to stop us? We haven’t done anything to offend you in any way.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“After wrecking my chamber? I wouldn’t be so sure,” there was an indescribable hardness in his words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll repay you later if you let us go now.” Gu Qingyu tried to escape the situation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t think so.” A cold smile crept across his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu frowned. “You’re making this hard for yourself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” Murong Zuoyu chuckled. “Just you two?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s not taking us seriously.” Jia Qizhe drew his sword and swung it towards Murong Zuoyu’s direction, “『Cleave』.” Immediately the sword sent out a dense blue sword energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as the surging sword energy almost reached Murong Zuoyu, he leapt gently up on the tree branch above. His speed was too fast for Gu Qingyu to even catch a glimpse of his footwork.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fwiiish——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu shot an arrow at Murong Zuoyu while he had his eyes on Jia Qizhe. Then shockingly, by swiftly turning his head sideways... Murong Zuoyu actually caught the arrow between his teeth!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The potency of sleeve arrow device Jia Qizhe gave her and the velocity of the arrows shot from it was not in the least bit weak.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He actually caught it by just turning his head?! And with his mouth!! How much more powerful could he get...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>As the saying goes, out of the thirty-six stratagems, retreat is the best! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu whispered in a low tone, “</span><i><span style>Let’s make a run for it.</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm.” Jia Qizhe grabbed her arm, and jumped up into the sky, heading towards the wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Clank——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two swords collided.</span></p>
