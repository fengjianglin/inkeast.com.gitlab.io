 <p>Qi Wan arrived at the capital of Nanyou, and with an anxious expression, he walked straight into an inn. When the innkeeper saw Qi Wan, he bowed respectfully. "Owner!"</p>
 <p>"Yes." Qi Wan nodded and beckoned the innkeeper with a wave as he kept walking. The innkeeper immediately fell in step behind him and followed Qi Wan to a room.</p>
 <p>"Owner, what's wrong?" he asked cautiously as soon as he closed the door.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan did not answer, he looked at the innkeeper with stern eyes instead. "How many of us are here?"</p>
 <p>The man was startled, but he quickly responded. "About two hundred people."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded. "Notify the other cities, get everyone to come here as soon as possible. Be ready to attack Nanyou's imperial city."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Master, you..." The innkeeper was so surprised that his tongue slipped. "What happened? Master, you never got angry in the eyes of your subordinates. Pardon my interjection, but attacking Nanyou is not a wise choice."</p>
 <p>"Your master’s wife has been caught by the Emperor of Nanyou, how can I not lose my temper? How can I not attack his city?" Qi Wan broke the cup in his hand as rage burned in his dark green orbs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Master’s wife?&nbsp;</em>The man knelt down immediately when he heard it, and his eyes were also deeply determined. "Yes! The subordinates will definitely call on all parties and rescue the boss lady!" <em>Finally, there is a wife!</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>Meanwhile</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's eyes opened with a flutter. Her mind was completely blank. She felt as though she had been asleep for a long time, but at the same time, she felt like she was jolted awake.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Who am I?</em></p>
 <p>She looked around, someone else was in the room. He was dressed in a white robe. There was a gentle smile on his face, a jade flute was tied to his waist, and he smelled like herbs.</p>
 <p>"Who are you?" She sat up. "Who am I? Why don't I remember anything?" The person before her seemed trustworthy, though the reason eludes her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I am Mo Bai," That person smiled softly as he sat down at the edge of the bed. "You're Yu'er, my empress."</p>
 <p>"Yu'er? Empress?" Gu Qingyu blinked doubtfully. "You're the emperor?"</p>
 <p>"Well, yes." Mo Bai nodded as he gently stroked Gu Qingyu's head. "Stay here and rest for a while, I'm going to get some medicine for you. I'll be right back."</p>
 <p>"Why do you have to get medicine? Am I sick?" Gu Qingyu looked at herself, she didn't have any injuries, and she felt quite healthy aside from her hazy memories.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, you'll feel even better after a few more doses. Mo Bai lowered his hand. "Yu'er, wait for me."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded obediently as she watched Mo Bai get up from the edge of the bed. Mo Bai was about to turn and leave, but someone was tugging on his sleeves. He turned around with a faint laugh. "What's the matter, Yu'er?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took a deep breath before raising her head and looked up at Mo Bai. Her face was slightly flushed. "Can you...not go? I don't want you to leave."</p>
 <p>Her sudden shyness stunned Mo Bai and he sat down next to her again. "Alright, I'll stay here with you."</p>
 <p>"Ok!" She grinned, her eyes narrowed into half-moons.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Soon, some people brought the medicine over instead. Mo Bai picked up the bowl, scooped a spoonful, put it on his lips and blew gently, before he finally brought the spoon to Gu Qingyu's lips. Gu Qingyu looked at the medicine, and then at Mo Bai.</p>
 <p>"It's okay, it's not bitter." Mo Bai looked at Gu Qingyu tenderly without moving his hand. The spoon remained right next to her lips as he patiently waited for her. Gu Qingyu nodded after hearing his answer and took the spoonful of medicine. The bowl of medicine was soon emptied, and just as he said, it was not bitter at all.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A figure suddenly appeared in her mind. A light blue robe. A devilish, teasing voice. But she could not make out his face, it was a complete blur. She flinched at the sudden image.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What's the matter?" As keen-eyed as Mo Bai, he immediately noticed her slight change in demeanor.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I...I think I saw someone..." Gu Qingyu looked down at the blanket that covered her legs, droplets dripped onto the fabric. "He is wearing a blue robe, and I don't know who he is..."</p>
 <p>Mo Bai's eyes turned cold in an instant, but the ice faded in an instant. He reached out and gently dabbed the corners of her eyes. "If you can't tell, then forget about it. Sleep would always help you feel better."</p>
 <p>"Ok..." Gu Qingyu nodded as she sniffled and laid down. She plucked up her courage and asked, "Mo Bai, can you...can you stay here until I fall asleep?"</p>
 <p>"Of course, Yu'er." Mo Bai reached out and tucked her in carefully. Gu Qingyu nodded, closed her eyes with satisfaction, and soon drifted off.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Mo Bai stood up once she drifted off, his face was icy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So, you still can't forget about him? In that case, I will make him disappear.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>He lifted his robe as he left the room. As soon as he stepped over the threshold, someone approached him. The man knelt down and said, "My liege, the soldiers of Dongxuan, Xiqian and Beiying have already sent troops and are coming towards our country!"</p>
 <p>Mo Bai nodded and commanded with a gentle voice. Gather all of our troops. Defeat is not an option."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes!" The man lowered his head, a drop of cold sweat slipped from the top of his forehead. Defeat was not an option, for defeat would beget a suffering more painful than death.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>In an empty world</strong></p>
 <p><em>Who am I? He said that my name is Yu'er. Who is the man in the blue robe? He was running towards me, his robe dancing and billowed against the sky, his lips were moving...Is he calling me?</em></p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er! Xiao Yu'er!"</p>
 <p><em>Xiao Yu'er? Is that my name too?</em></p>
 <p>His facial features were vague, but he had this natural, intoxicating charm that drew her towards him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Who are you?" That question escaped her lips, but that man didn't answer her. Instead, he held her hand in his and walked forward. Gu Qingyu somehow felt relieved and followed his lead. Suddenly, a person wearing a white robe descended from the sky, with black wings on his back. Feathers that matched the colour of his wings rained from above.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Mo Bai? You..." She did not expect to see him, and was about to approach him when the man in blue robe stood between them and blocked her. The jade flute in Mo Bai's hand impaled that man in an instant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No!" Her eyes widened as she watched that man collapsed to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er..." he whispered, the smile on his lips familiar.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu knelt down next to him. "No! Ye Jin, don't die!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Her eyes opened in a snap, the room was pitch dark. She rubbed her head, her brain felt fuzzy. She could sense something next to her. She turned around, it was not something, but someone. A red robe, a playful look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was startled. "Who are you?"</p>
 <p>The man eyed her suspiciously. "What's the matter, kitten? I've only been gone for a few days, did you forget about me already?"</p>
 <p>"Kitten?" Gu Qingyu stared at him. "Me?"</p>
 <p>Xie Zang sighed and slapped his forehand. "Well, I finally know why you can sleep so peacefully."</p>
 <p>"What the hell are you talking about?" Gu Qingyu asked suspiciously, "Get out, this is my room!"</p>
 <p>"Oh, your room?" Xie Zang raised his lips and laughed, "Did you lose your memories? Then why do you remember Ye Jin?"</p>
 <p>"Ye Jin? Who is Ye Jin... Have I met him before?" Gu Qingyu was even more puzzled as the image of that man in her dreams returned to her mind. Right then, a sharp pain pierced through her chest. Another jolt of pain went through her head. The more she tried to recall that man's face, the more her head threatened to split open. Her hand held her chest as she squeezed out her voice. "Get out! Or I'm going to scream for Mo Bai!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Are you alright, Kitten?" Xie Zang leaned forward to check on her. His soft, long locks flowed down his shoulders and gently brushed against her face and left a slight ticklish sensation. "I'm Xie Zang, don’t you remember?" He whispered softly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xie Zang?" Gu Qingyu pondered for a while before she shook her head. "I don't remember. Have we met before?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, we also went on adventures together..." Xie Zang smiled bitterly and suddenly hugged Gu Qingyu. "It's all my fault. I should have come back earlier to protect you, my Kitten!"</p>
 <p>His embrace startled her, but Gu Qingyu did not push him away. And when she lowered her head, tears were streaming down her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What is this inexplicable sense of familiarity? There really seems to be a feeling that she had met him at the beginning of time. There was also a group of people whose faces are blurred, but all of them were by her side.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"Don't cry," Xie Zang was shocked when she saw her sudden tears and immediately dabbed away her tears with his sleeves. "Wait for me! I will definitely help you turn back to normal one day!"</p>
 <p>"What do you mean, turn back to normal?" Gu Qingyu bawled. "Who is Ye Jin? Why does my head and my chest hurts the moment I think of him? And why can't I remember anything about him?" She felt like a child who had lost their most beloved toy, but no matter where they looked, they could not find it. Even though it was supposed to be in their house, the toy remains firmly just out of reach.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You'll remember soon, don't cry." Xie Zang suddenly heard the footsteps of fast approaching, patting Gu Qingyu's head lightly, "I have to go, Mo Bai will be here soon. Wait for me, I will help you remember everything tomorrow!" Gu Qingyu looked up, and the mysterious man in red had long vanished.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The door was pushed open, Gu Qingyu followed the sound and her eyes met with someone in a white robe. The cold moonlight lit up his features and his calm face was full of tenderness.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, why are you up? Did anyone come here?" He spoke softly, even the words were so gentle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu sniffed slightly and remembered Xie Zang. She shook her head. "No, I just had a nightmare."</p>
 <p><em>Sorry, Mo Bai. I don't want to lie to you, but I really really need to find out the truth. Then I can stay with you forever.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"Nightmare?" Mo Bai walked in and sat at the edge of her bed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Um..." Gu Qingyu nodded after a pause. "It seems that there is a person called Ye Jin..."</p>
 <p>"Alright, continue." Mo Bai's expression remained unchanged, and his voice was so gentle.</p>
 <p>"He called me Xiao Yu'er, and..." Gu Qingyu couldn't speak anymore, the pain had returned. "The more I think about it, the more my chest hurts..."</p>
 <p>"Then don't think about it." Mo Bai stroked her head. "Go to sleep, I'll be right here."</p>
 <p>"Alright." Gu Qingyu nodded and laid down again.</p>

 <p>Xie Zang is back! When I first read the chapter and read about the red robe, I thought it would be Yan Zun instead. So I’m a little disappointed. FYI, Mo Bai has taken away the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny and her weapons as well. </p>
