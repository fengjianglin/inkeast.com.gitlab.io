 <p><strong>Chapter 8: You know medical arts?</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Me?” Gu Qingyu switched back to her playful, childlike voice, “Why are you looking for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have been living a secluded life together with my mentor in a peaceful and quiet place, far from the Imperial City. Back there, my mentor taught me martial arts, magic, as well as literature and poetry. He taught me everything I know. He is like a father to me,” Qi Yichen smiled as he talked about his mentor. His smile was so refined and so elegant, she was startled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“[So?]” Gu Qingyu suddenly realised she was speaking in English and quickly regained her composure, “So? Why are you telling me this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Qi Yichen spoke of his secluded life, she subconsciously thought of Mo Bai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He has been there for me all along, so I want to do the same for him. A few days ago, my mentor told me that he’d contracted a serious illness. He also told me that there is a mysterious young woman in the capital by the name of Gu Qingyu. She is the only one person in this world who can cure his illness.” He paused for a moment. “If I may be so bold to ask, will you accept this invitation of mine to our humble abode, miss?” He smiled his sweet-tempered smile.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mysterious? Cure? Sure, I was classified as a doctor back in my world, but I worked mainly in the aspects of psychology and psychiatry! However, I did learn the essentials back in university...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Erm....” Gu Qingyu did not immediately reply to his request. Instead, she attempted to derail him, “I see! You mentioned that you were a scholar, right? I’m sure an intelligent and handsome individual like you must’ve heard of this saying before, 『Do not be surprised, for this world is grand. Anything could happen!』 We may have the same name, but maybe you’ve found the wrong person?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen shook his head firmly at the attempt. “No, I have already made inquiries all over the capital. There’s only one young woman named Gu Qingyu here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He even looked me up? He seems pretty determined to take me with him!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I beg your pardon, Young Master Qi. If I were to leave, My family will be worried,” said Gu Qingyu and returned his smile.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Now, let’s see what you can come up with!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen’s smile only deepened. “Let me be completely honest with you, miss. Aside from magic, my mentor also taught me a nudge in the arts of divination. I just calculated earlier upon the possibilities of you leaving with me. By my art of divination, I found out you actually don’t want to stay much longer in the Gu Manor. You are even searching for someone to help you escape, right, miss?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>... Is he really just an ordinary scholar? What kind of scholar is this!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu’s worldview crumbled down from this traumatic discovery.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>How come even a scholar is so incredible!!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu waved her hands listlessly, disinterested. “Alright, you win. But you can’t make me——” She suddenly had second thoughts just as she was to refuse him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait a minute! Something’s amiss. What if that jerk backs out again? Or say, what if I don’t get first place? I need a backup plan.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“... But you can’t make me </span><b>not</b><span style> go with you!” Her demeanour did a complete 180-degree change from low to highly energetic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen smiled and said, “You have my gratitude, miss.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yo,” she heard a chilly voice call out behind them. “You don’t need me anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jia Qizhe?” Gu Qingyu turned her head. “Pff! What am I supposed to do if you change your mind again? You’ve done it twice already.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe chuckled and leaned in closer to her ear. “</span><i><span style>Then what are you supposed to do if you can’t save his mentor?</span></i><span style>”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm...” Gu Qingyu froze up hearing this.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He’s got a point! This Qi-something has gone through all these troubles and hardships in order to find me... so what if I really can’t cure his mentor?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Qi, I’ll have you know that I am not an expert in the arts of medicine. What are you going to do if I’m helpless against your mentor’s illness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen let out a faint sigh. “It is of no matter. My mentor also mentioned that everything will be fine as long as I take you to him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, in that case, I’m in!” Gu Qingyu laughed, and turned her head back to Jia Qizhe. “Oi! Do you want to come?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aha! The tables have finally turned in my favour! I actually get to ask him instead of begging this time!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure,” said Jia Qizhe and shrugged his shoulders. “Sounds fun.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fun?” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes at him. “Do you think we’re going out on an adventure or something?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is that not the case for you?” he asked back.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>... Fine, he got me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Gu Qingyu didn’t reply and made her way back towards her seat. “They’re going to announce the winners now! Let’s watch it together.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The trio sat down beside to each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A young boy walked up on stage. It was the same boy who argued with her earlier!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>He is one of the judges?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It took Gu Qingyu by surprise.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style>“We hereby announce the rankings of the annual Performing Arts and Craftsmanship Competition.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style>In the first place, Gu Qingyu. The perfect combination of a beautiful voice and a splendid song. Miss Gu is truly in a class of her own.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style>In the second place, Zhao Jin’er. She skillfully displayed her pipa techniques, smooth and delightful...”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>As they continued to announce the rankings, Gu Qingyu was so excited she almost jumped out of her seat. “O’ Yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen applauded her and said, “Miss Gu is truly deserving of being in first place.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu felt uncomfortable being called ‘Miss’ and ‘Young Lady’ all the time. “You don’t have to be so polite with me. Just call me Qingyu!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“... Qingyu,” Qi Yichen tried calling. “Then you should also call me by my name.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since Gu Qingyu wasn’t interested in the any of the rewards, she decided to return home when the competition finally came to an end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before she left, she said to Qi Yichen, “Let me go home and pack my things. We can leave tonight! Wait for me under the crooked tree in our courtyard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen nodded, “Thank you for your trouble, Mi——Qingyu.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You too!” Gu Qingyu gestured towards Jia Qizhe, “Come on, let's leave!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Jia Qizhe didn’t reply and just followed her quietly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qi Yichen’s gaze locked on Gu Qingyu’s departing back, a faint smile touched the corners of his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Back at the General’s Residence.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu’s mother came and welcomed her, “Well done, Yu’er! I watched your performance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded, “Thank you, mother.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This woman treated her well. Gu Qingyu felt almost sorry and regretful to leave her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>There's no future for me in this place.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi entered Gu Qingyu’s room and asked almost immediately, “Mistress, how did it go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Perfect!” Gu Qingyu began to tell Xiao Qi of everything from beginning to end. She told her about the boy, how she met Qi Yichen, how she got first place, and about their escape plan. “Let’s leave together tonight!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi nodded, ”Mm!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu suddenly recalled some of the recent thoughts she had when she looked at Xiao Qi. “... Xiao Qi?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you really willing to go with me?” Never once had she asked for Xiao Qi’s opinions. It was always her who pushed to leave this place.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wherever you go, I will go, Mistress!” said Xiao Qi firmly and nodded at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A smile broke out on Gu Qingyu's face. “I love you, Xiao Qi. Go back and pack your things!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Qi nodded and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu heaved out a heavy breath.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I’m... finally... able... to... leave!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She went out for a breather after she finished packing her belongings, taking a last stroll around her 'home'.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she arrived at the pavilion she usually visited, quite unexpectedly, Jia Qizhe was already there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Why are you here?” asked Gu Qingyu aloud in a surprised manner.&nbsp;</span></p>
