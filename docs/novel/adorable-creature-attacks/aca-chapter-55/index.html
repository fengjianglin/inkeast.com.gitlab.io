 <p>Soon, they found the restaurant opened by Qi Wan. The restaurant was well-furnished, brightly-lit and filled with customers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh my god! Qi Wan, how do you do this!" Gu Qingyu was completely floored.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan gloated. "How's it? Do you really admire me? Marry me and you’ll have nothing to worry about. You can even spend your money freely~ Hey, hey, what are you two doing? Ah! ah! Help!!!!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan's sorrowful voice faded into the distance as Gu Qingyu waved at Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai while holding her laughter. "Okay, let's eat."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Mo Bai closed his hand, his sleeves were as white as snow, and his robes were spotless. He looked completely different from the violent man just now.</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe glared at Qi Wan as he stood next to Gu Qingyu. "Watch out."</p>
 <p><em>Why does this tone sound familiar...&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Qi Wan silently rubbed his nose and slowly sat down in his seat.</p>
 <p><em>People nowadays...</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Qi Wan," Gu Qingyu turned to him with a twinkle of mischief in her eyes. "Since you are so influential, do you have a racecourse or something like that?"</p>
 <p><em>Racecourse? Is such an idea conceivable by ordinary people?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Qi Wan shook his head sincerely. "I don't really have that kind of thing."</p>
 <p>"Tch." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes as if she had been offended.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was speechless. <em>Boss, does your family know you have such ridiculous standards!&nbsp;</em>He pursed his lips. "But I have a friend who runs a stable. It's near here, we can go and take a look."</p>
 <p>"Well, okay." Gu Qingyu took her time and ate her meal.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The party followed Qi Wan to the stable after lunch.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan," Gu Qingyu walked into the stable and noticed the handsome guy in front of her. "Are you sure this is a horse stable? That person... is the owner?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah, yeah." Qi Wan nodded. "Is he as handsome as me?"</p>
 <p>"No, he's more handsome than you." Gu Qingyu stated without a moment of hesitation.<em>&nbsp;I thought stables are just filled with horses? It should be all grey and dusty, with a horrible stench. And the owner should be a big and burly man, who held a horsewhip as he dug his nose… What is happening right now? This stable was bright and colourful. Horses are lined up neatly one after another, and there's a faint fragrance in the air. Plus, there's a super cute guy dressed in brown in front of her! Most importantly, why does all this look so harmonious and balanced?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"Hello." The handsome man smiled slightly. "My name is Luo Zhi."</p>
 <p><em>Luo Zhi? Strange name.</em></p>
 <p>"Hello." Gu Qingyu smiled sweetly. "We want to buy some horses."</p>
 <p>"You're a friend of Mister Qi. Please, pick whichever you like." Luo Zhi nodded to her before he turned to Qi Wan. "How have you been, Mister Qi?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I have been well." Qi Wan nodded solemnly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Huh, why is he putting on airs all of a sudden?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at the horses of varying coats and colours, she was stunned. <em>Oh dear, what to do? I have never ridden a horse before...</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe walked over with a dark horse. "Yu'er, this is for you."</p>
 <p>"Ah, ah! My prized thousand-mile steed!" Luo Zhi suddenly covered his face. "How did you find it?"</p>
 <p><em>Well, that's an obvious and sudden change.&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu sighed slightly. "Since you seem reluctant, why don't we..."</p>
 <p>"We'll thank you in advance." Jia Qizhe finished her sentence as he smiled at Luo Zhi.</p>
 <p>"My prized thousand-mile steed..." Luo Zhi flattened his lips and stared at Jia Qizhe bitterly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe sighed slightly and shook his head. "Let's go, Yu'er." &nbsp;A white horse had somehow appeared next to them.</p>
 <p>"Ahhh! My prized steed's brother!" Luo Zhi's cries grew even more distressed.</p>
 <p>"You told us to take our pick." Qi Yichen smiled slightly, and a white horse was in his hand.</p>
 <p>"Buttercup!" Luo Zhi was heartbroken, he almost started to cry.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>...Buttercup?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu watched Luo Zhi sympathetically. He really had rotten luck, it was not fun to come across this party. Worse still, all of them were martial arts experts...</p>
 <p>She sighed and shook her head, holding the dark horse. "Come, Daisy. Let's go."</p>
 <p>Everyone else thought, <em>Daisy? Is there any difference between you and Luo Zhi?</em></p>
 <p>"What, Daisy?" Luo Zhi glared at Gu Qingyu. "Her name is Sage!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Your eyeballs look good." Jia Qizhe wriggled his finger. "If you don't mind, you can look at her a few more times, so I can dig them out together."</p>
 <p>Luo Zhi closed his mouth and his face suddenly changed into the stiff smile of customer service. "We welcome your next visit!" He turned and glared at Qi Wan, the same smile still plastered on his face. " We are finished, my friend. "</p>
 <p><em>Qi Wan’s inner monologue: Do you know you would be struck by lighting if you take your anger out on other people?</em></p>
 <p>"Friend, don't do this ..." Qi Wan immediately clung to Luo Zhi.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Later</strong></p>
 <p>The eight of them traveled through the street on horseback, it almost seemed like a parade. Qi Wan sulked and sighed the whole time.</p>
 <p>"What's the matter?" It was clear that Qi Wan was in a foul mood, Gu Qingyu turned slightly and checked on him. She dared not shift too much, since she's not familiar with horse-riding. Fortunately, she is accompanied by two equestrian veterans, Jia Qizhe and Murong Zuoyu.</p>
 <p>"I lost a friend." Qi Wan sniffled as he wiped a tear. "Oh why, why did this happen!"</p>
 <p>"...Luo Zhi?" Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan with surprise. Qi Wan nodded, with regret and sorrow written on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh!" Gu Qingyu sighed and shook her head. "Oh, I'm so sorry. I didn't realise you two were so close..."</p>
 <p>"...Uhhh?" That was an odd response. Qi Wan could feel that something was afoot.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I know it pains you to leave him!" Another sigh.</p>
 <p>"Boss, you misunderstood, listen to me..." Qi Wan opened his mouth.</p>
 <p>"Yes, yes, we all misunderstood you!" Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan with an understanding look, full of support and encouragement. "Don't worry, I have gone through the same pain before as well. It's hard to let go! But if you really can't forget about him, then go! Chase after your heart!"</p>
 <p>"Don't!" Qi Wan cried. "Master!"</p>
 <p>"Go!" Sighed Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"No! I won't go! Master!"</p>
 <p>Everyone else watched as they bickered. <em>Just what in the world are you two doing?</em></p>
 <p>"Now that you've made up your mind, let's make haste." Gu Qingyu smiled and speeded up without looking back. "Well... This is wobbly... Help! Brother Murong! Jia Qizhe! Ah ah- "&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu silently rubbed his temples, then gave chase.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After a distance, Gu Qingyu finally stopped the horse with the help of Hero Jia and Duke Yu.</p>
 <p>"Life is so difficult these days!" Gu Qingyu said with tears in her eyes. "Oh, I could cry just thinking about it!"</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, Hurry up,” Mo Bai looked at the dim sky. "It seems that we still have to spend the night outside today."</p>
 <p>Ever since she revealed her true identity to Murong Zuoyu, everyone's monikers for her had returned to normal. But that has caused her an even greater headache. Gu Qingyu nodded. "Okay, there is a river ahead, let's go there and settle down."</p>
 <p>"Still craving for grilled fish?" Xie Zang smiled and looked at Gu Qingyu. "You're really a kitten~" Gu Qingyu chose to give him an eye roll as he trotted over.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>At Camp</strong></p>
 <p>Soon, with the help of a few experts, the grilled fish were ready. Gu Qingyu chewed on her fish as she analysed the map Qi Wan had taken from somewhere. After a while, she said, "The imperial city is still a long way from here. We'll have to ride non-stop tomorrow, and if needed, cover the remaining distance by flight. So the earliest we'll arrive would be tomorrow night." She paused. "So there's no need to hurry, or we'll burn out before we even reach the imperial city. "</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen listened to Gu Qingyu with admiration. "So, what's the plan, Brother Zhu?"</p>
 <p>"Tomorrow, we'll go to Luocheng, the city next to the imperial city, to rest up. We’ll proceed with the negotiations on the next day. Then, if that doesn't work out, we'll storm the castle!" Gu Qingyu snapped her fingers. "Perfect!"</p>
 <p>"It is indeed a good plan." Qi Yichen nodded. "It would be too dangerous if Brother Murong confronted the Emperor of Beiying alone." His words surprised Murong Zuoyu.</p>
 <p>"Hey, that's a good idea!" Gu Qingyu nodded. "Brother Qi, you can go with him! Two people can take care of it!"</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen wished he had not opened his mouth. He could not even argue that it was just a suggestion? That would never work against Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>The next morning</strong></p>
 <p>Eight people and eight horses trotted through the grassy plains as they headed towards Luocheng. Since they have been riding for a while, Gu Qingyu was more comfortable and let her horse move freely. Besides, she could still count on the experts with her. On the other hand, Xiao Qi has not had any trouble. She was very comfortable with horse-riding.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh Xiao Qi, I couldn't tell!" Gu Qingyu teased. "Come on, come on, keep this up and you could be a heroine in the future!"</p>
 <p><em>Heroine?&nbsp;</em>The rest of the party turned and looked at Xiao Qi. Her weak arms and thin frame made her ladylike demeanor very clear. She replied, even her voice was soft and sweet. "Xiao Yu, don't make fun of me..."</p>
 <p><em>We dare to ask Gu Qingyu the Heroine, how does this remind her of a heroine?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu coughed. "Well, let's hurry."</p>
 <p>They increased their pace and finally arrived in Luocheng at night. Qi Wan winked at Gu Qingyu as they settled down in an inn. "Boss, I said I'll take you to the arsenal, it's near here."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu instinctively turned the red lotus pendant in her fingers. <em>After all, it ’s Yan Zun's weapon. I still need to get my own weapon.</em></p>
 <p>"Then everyone would rest in the inn while Qi Wan takes me to the arsenal?" Gu Qingyu asked tentatively.</p>
 <p>"I wanted to go with you..." Jia Qizhe looked out the window. "But I have some important things to do, sorry."</p>
 <p>"It's okay." Gu Qingyu smiled.</p>
 <p>"I'll go too." Mo Bai looked faintly at Jia Qizhe.</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe froze, then looked at Mo Bai with crossed arms. "Why does it concern you?"</p>
 <p>Mo Bai remained silent.</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, don't fight. Let's go. Qi Wan?" Gu Qingyu looked back at Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>"Yes, milord!" Qi Wan saluted and led the way.</p>

 <p>The original names of the horses were mere colours, like white, green and yellow. So Gu Qingyu called a dark horse Little White. But I struggled to find names that flowed, so I went to flower names instead. </p>
