 <p>After Yan Zun finished berating her, he seemed to have calmed down and interrupted Gu Qingyu’s question, “You want to ask how I managed to appear in flesh? Actually, it’s quite easy. I spent nearly a thousand years’ worth of power to have that physical form for half a minute.”</p>
 <p><em>Nearly a thousand years? That much?!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“Then, is there any way to get it back?” Gu Qingyu asked cautiously. She didn’t think there would be a way to get all that power back, but she still felt obligated to try.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“You think it is easy for a soul to be in a corporeal form?” Yan Zun looked at her and threw back the question.</p>
 <p>“I…” Gu Qingyu panicked. “Master…”</p>
 <p>“So, for the next few days, unless it is absolutely necessary, don’t disturb me.” Yan Zun closed his eyes again.</p>
 <p>“Huh? Does that mean things aren’t too bad? Master, are you alright?”</p>
 <p>“It was nothing anyway, I just needed to rest for a few days.” Yan Zun cracked open one eye while he replied. The furrow between his brows had disappeared, there was even a twinkle in his eye. “Besides… It does not matter if I can’t get it back, what does a thousand years of power count for? I still have tens of thousands of years.”</p>
 <p><em>He was just being arrogant! This piece of rock is actually an arrogant brat!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Next time, be more careful, finish off the person then slowly ‘educate’ him.” Yan Zun’s tone turned a serious note.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Huh? Finish off the person then slowly ‘educate’ them?”</p>
 <p>“Also, your skills at educating people are embarrassing. As your master, I’ll have to teach you sometime.” Yan Zun stretched his hand out and suddenly grabbed Gu Qingyu’s ankle.</p>
 <p>“Huh? Master, what are you...Ah!” Before she finished, Gu Qingyu felt a tug on her leg and she fell into the hot spring.</p>
 <p><em>I cannot swim…</em></p>
 <p>“Help! Murder! A ten-thousand-year-old rock demon is killing a smart, kind and pure beautiful girl!” Gu Qingyu flailed in the water as she screamed. Yan Zun looked at her in defeat, but there was a smirk on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Ten-thousand-year-old rock demon? Beautiful girl? Very good.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu continued to flail her arms, but something was not right. She calmed down and regained her footing at the bottom of the spring, the spring’s water only reached up to her waist.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yan Zun watched as gears turned in Gu Qingyu’s head, all while he toyed with his long hair. “Ten-thousand-year-old rock demon?”</p>
 <p>“Um…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This was embarrassing, did I say something bad?</em></p>
 <p>“Beautiful girl?” Yan Zun’s lips curled into a smile.</p>
 <p>“Um…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I really want to nod! But would I be alive if I do?</em></p>
 <p>“Master, I did not say anything just now!” Gu Qingyu immediately raised three fingers and swore to the heavens.</p>
 <p>Yan Zun smiled. In that instant, a streak of lightning crossed the blood-red sky, followed by a rumble of thunder. “You would really be punished by the heavens.”</p>
 <p><em>How did I forget this place is owned by this rock!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“...Master, I’m wrong! You are a generous man…” Gu Qingyu sobbed.</p>
 <p>“You’re wrong, I am a ten-thousand-year-old rock demon.” Yan Zun corrected in a serious tone.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu felt like giving herself a hard slap. “No, you’re not! I’m absolutely horrible and pathetic...”</p>
 <p>“You’re wrong again, you’re a smart, kind and pure beautiful girl.” Yan Zun corrected her again.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Master!” Gu Qingyu was about to collapse.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He’s really not the kind of person you want to mess with!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“Master, I am wrong.” Gu Qingyu was about to climb back ashore, but Yan Zun held her in place.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yan Zun gently closed his eyes, seemingly tired. “Hold it, the water here helps with your recovery.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu studied his reaction, she finally stopped protesting and sat quietly in the water.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Master, didn’t you say that day that I can only soak in here after coming back from the marketplace?” &nbsp;Gu Qingyu asked curiously, “Is there something there?”</p>
 <p>Yan Zun nodded. “You remember that lantern?”</p>
 <p><em>Lantern? The one I gave Jia Qizhe?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu nodded, “Yes.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“There is a fragrance inside that freshens up the mind… Anyway, it’s beneficial to both you and me.” Yan Zun’s lips twitched and slapped himself on the forehead. “I’m getting infected by you.”</p>
 <p><em>You’re blaming me?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu’s lips twitched too. “Thank you, Master, can I go now?’</p>
 <p>Yan Zun waved. “Go, I need to rest too, if there is nothing important, then don’t disturb me for the next few days.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Urgh…” Gu Qingyu opened her eyes, it felt as though she was splitting in half. Mo Bai was before her, his fingers wrapped around her wrist as he took her pulse.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They made eye contact, Mo Bai gently leaned back and smiled. “You’re awake?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded tersely. She shifted her elbows and tried to push herself up from the bed, but Mo Bai pressed her down. Then, the splitting pain returned to her chest.</p>
 <p>“Don’t rush to get up, you’ve been unconscious for three days, drink some water first.” Mo Bai took the pot on the table and gently poured water in a little white ceramic cup. His slender fingers gently grasped the cup, he held it up and set it close to Gu Qingyu’s lips.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was taken aback. Blood rushed to her head. Something trickled out from her nose. Mo Bai’s eyes widened, he whipped out a handkerchief and passed it to Gu Qingyu. Realisation hit Gu Qingyu and she covered her nose with the handkerchief.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How embarrassing! I actually had a nosebleed in front of Prince Charming!</em></p>
 <p>She took the cup from Mo Bai’s hands and took small, slow sips. Mo Bai nodded, satisfied. “Yu’er, you will fully recover after a few more days of rest.”</p>
 <p>“A few days?” Gu Qingyu was surprised. “Don’t we have to go to Beiying?”</p>
 <p>“No worries, we can go after Yu’er recovered.” Mo Bai’s tone was gentle as he took back the cup and set it on the table.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Then… that woman?” Gu Qingyu hesitated but she had to ask.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“She wanted to kill herself but Jia Qizhe stopped her in time, but he could not get anything out of her.” Mo Bai sighed. “The Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny is not something good, Yu’er. It will bring you troubles and woes. This attack, that dagger was an inch away from your heart. You’re lucky this time, but what about the next?”</p>
 <p>“I know, Mo Bai.” Gu Qingyu looked at him with resolve. &nbsp;“But I want to go on.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the beginning, she did treat it all like a game. But after seeing Yan Zun’s resolute back and angry eyes, she became determined to help him. Not for herself, or for Qi Wan. Even if she could not go back. She just wanted to help him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yu’er…” Mo Bai stopped mid-sentence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu probed gently, “What is it?”</p>
 <p>“Who was that red man?” Mo Bai asked, his eyes filled with curiosity.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu did not mind his prying. “A friend.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Yes, a friend. Regardless, Yan Zun’s identity could not be revealed, it was a promise between them.</em></p>
 <p>“Well, I get it.” Mo Bai nodded. “Yu’er, rest well, I won’t disturb you any longer.” He got up from his seat and headed towards the door.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“...Sorry, Mo Bai.” Gu Qingyu stopped him in his tracks. “Sorry, I don’t mean to hide this from you, but I really promised. It’s not like I don’t trust you, but I…”</p>
 <p>“Yu’er, that’s enough, I’ll support whatever you do.” Mo Bai turned back and gave a gentle smile.</p>
 <p>“Yeap!” Gu Qingyu smiled too. “Thank you.”</p>
 <p>Mo Bai pushed open the door and walked out.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Questions plagued Gu Qingyu’s mind. <em>Who is that pink woman? What I do know is that someone really wants to kill me. Is it for the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny? Or for some other reason? Whoever it is, that person is really powerful, not just because of the assassination last night, but the fact that he could infiltrate a remote area like this.</em></p>
 <p>Alas, she did not know that this place was the ‘Fragrance Hall’, a location fairly famous in the martial arts world.</p>
 <p>A knock pulled Gu Qingyu out of her thoughts. Gu Qingyu lifted her head, “Who is it? Come in.”</p>
 <p>The door was pushed open, it was Jia Qizhe. He closed the door, walked in and sat on the bedside. “Are you alright...Yu’er?”</p>
 <p>“Cough, cough!” Gu Qingyu hacked, the coughing sent a sharp pain through her chest. “Ouch!”</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe panicked, “What happened to you?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu slowed her breathing and calmed down. “Ah! I was just shocked by you!”</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe replied, “Was that weird?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately nodded frantically, like she had seen a ghost.</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe’s face darkened. “What, Mo Bai can call you that and I can’t?”</p>
 <p>“No!” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. “I’m just not used to it. Besides coming from someone like you, it does sound a little weird…”</p>
 <p>“What’s weird? You’ll get used to it in the future.” Jia Qizhe smirked. &nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>The future? Oh dear…</em></p>
 <p>“That’s right, the pink lady, she…” She double-checked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe held his chin with his hand. “Yeah, I kept her for you.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Kept her for me? Thank you for that, if I didn’t know better, it could almost pass as a gift.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu waved weakly. “I will take a look when I’m better.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Jia Qizhe nodded. “I’m just here to check on you. If there’s nothing else, then get some sleep, your wounds have not healed yet.” That was the first time he said so much in his gentle voice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“...Okay.” Gu Qingyu gently closed her eyes.</p>
 <p>She felt someone tucked her in then the person walked out in soft steps, her heart was all warm and fuzzy.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe stepped out from Gu Qingyu’s room, Mo Bai had been waiting outside.</p>
 <p>“What?” Jia Qizhe smiled, but it was not fully genuine.</p>
 <p>“Nothing.” Mo Bai shot Jia Qizhe an icy look, like a king looking down at a peasant. “Stay away from her.” Darkness was written on his face</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe was not to be trifled with too, he snorted. “You…”</p>
 <p>“Who do you think you are?” A smug voice rang out, Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai’s face both darkened.</p>
