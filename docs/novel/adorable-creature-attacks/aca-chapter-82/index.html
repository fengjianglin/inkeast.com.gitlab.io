<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><strong>The games begin</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately took Murong Zuoyu's hand and bolted upstairs frantically, as though they were chased by a ghost. She regretted the groupings as soon as the games started. <em>Putting Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai in one team, isn't that just digging my own grave? Oh no, it's more than digging my grave. It's like digging my own grave then filling it myself!&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu could cry at her bad decision.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The pair sprinted all the way to the third floor, Gu Qingyu dragged the two of them into a supply closet. After the door closed, she let go of Murong Zuoyu's hand and stopped to catch her breath. <em>His hands are so cold!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu looked at Gu Qingyu with a slight flush across his cheeks, it may or may not have been caused by the running. "Actually, we don't need to run."</p>
 <p>"Eh?" Gu Qingyu looked at Murong Zuoyu, her eyes full of doubts.</p>
 <p>He cleared his throat and looked at Gu Qingyu seriously. "I am quite strong."</p>
 <p>"...What?" Gu Qingyu seriously thought that something happened to her hearing, or that her brain had shorted. <em>Why would someone as cool and cold as Murong Zuoyu say anything like Qi Wan?</em></p>
 <p>"I'm serious." He repeated himself, as Gu Qingyu still had disbelief written all over her face. His face was still flushed. "So, don't be afraid of them, I can protect you."</p>
 <p><em>Oh, so that's what he meant!&nbsp;</em>She nodded. "Thank you!"</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Just then, someone kicked down the door. Qi Wan's punch-worthy face soon appeared. "Hand over my Boss! And I just might let you live!"</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu silently shifted his hand to the sword hanging on his waist, his hand rested on the hilt of the sword. Qi Wan was not intimidated at all, he shouted again, "Come at me, bro! I'll fight you fair and square!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu pulled out the sword, and his other hand quickly swept over the blade. As his hand swept over the blade, it emitted a purple glow. Qi Wan did not back down either. He waved his hand and a ribbon flew out from his sleeve.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Boom!&nbsp;</em>Something banged and smashed. Qi Wan swayed on his feet, then collapsed to the ground. His ribbon also dropped to the floor with a flop.</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan!" Gu Qingyu let out a scream. She rushed over his side and checked, he had simply fainted. She breathed a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As Qi Wan fell to the floor, Jia Qizhe was revealed to be standing behind him, with a bat in his hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Um... Not bad..." Gu Qingyu could feel cold sweat pooling on her back.</p>
 <p>"Watch and learn, Xiao Yu'er. This is called an ambush." Jia Qizhe grinned, the corners of his eyes crinkled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Are you sure? &nbsp;Cause it just looks like a sneak attack." Gu Qingyu looked at Jia Qizhe with great suspicion.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan rolled over. "Boss, save me ..."</p>
 <p>"Still alive?" Jia Qizhe raised an eyebrow.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately ran up to stop Jia Qizhe. "Lower your bat, oh great hero! Look, he's already in such a pitiful state... We should carry forward the spirit of love and pass on this love forever"</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe looked at Qi Wan and smiled. "I have no love for this man."</p>
 <p><em>I have to say, Hero Jia, you've spoken your thoughts aloud.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu grimaced "Xiao Zhezhe, we should all get along peacefully and harmoniously!"</p>
 <p>"The games are still going on." Behind her, Murong Zuoyu gave them a cold reminder. The sword in his hand flew out, bypassing Gu Qingyu and striking directly at Jia Qizhe.</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe smiled contemptuously and jumped up. His hand gently grabbed the hilt and threw back the sword. The sword flew back, straight towards Murong Zuoyu. He immediately tilted his body and avoided the flying blade. It brushed past him and stabbed into the wall. If he did not dodge that attack, then the sword would have stabbed his heart. Murong Zuoyu's face darkened, he drew his sword and chanted a spell. The tension in the air was evident, and Gu Qingyu knew that Murong Zuoyu and Jia Qizhe were about to fight seriously. She grabbed Qi Wan by the collar and dragged him along as she sprinted downstairs.</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe didn't care about Gu Qingyu, he smiled slightly at her instead. "Xiao Yu'er, I'll go find you after I finish this guy."</p>
 <p>"Tch, big talk." Murong Zuoyu was already running up to him, sword in hand.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu dragged Qi Wan to the second floor and stopped to catch her breath as she listened to the sound of banging and metal clashing from the floor above. She glanced at the ceiling with concern. <em>I hope it does not collapse.</em></p>
 <p>"Thank you, Boss." Qi Wan immediately got up and gave her a 90 degree bow. "I, Qi Wan, will never forget your great grace and mercy! Please let Qi Wan serve you for all of eternity!"</p>
 <p>"Have you lost your marbles?" Gu Qingyu looked at him suspiciously. "We're still competing," she reminded him with a sigh.</p>
 <p>"Oh, right." Qi Wan nodded, and he laid down on the floor again. "Ah! I lost! Boss is truly the strongest!"</p>
 <p>"...Do you have to be so exaggerated?" Gu Qingyu cringed and then looked at Qi Wan seriously. "I think you should actually put up a good act, like with a serious 'I have been defeated!'. Then lie on the floor and writhe in pain for a while before making a permanent exit."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan's face paled at her proposition. <em>Boss this is just a competition! A competition! Not an actual fight to the death!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "This encounter tells us that we should exercise more, and don't provoke those who look handsome and badass!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan waved weakly and got up. "I'm going to find Qi Yichen. Good luck, Boss..."</p>
 <p>"Good, Qi Yichen really lonely, all by himself." Gu Qingyu said and nodded self-assuringly. She then patted Qi Wan's shoulder knowingly. "Good luck, bro! I will always support you. Just do it!"</p>
 <p><em>I just want to kill you now. Just that, nothing else.&nbsp;</em>Qi Wan's face had just gone through rigor mortis.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After Qi Wan left, Gu Qingyu walked out of the door and saw Mo Bai, who was walking over from a distance. In his hand was that jade flute. Gu Qingyu immediately darted back inside to hide, but she heard Mo Bai call from outside with a tired voice. "Yu'er, I saw you."</p>
 <p><em>Impeccable tenderness, unique to Mo Bai.&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu originally wanted to feign ignorance and hide for a while, but after looking at Mo Bai's beautiful face, she finally closed her eyes and walked out.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, what's wrong?" Seeing Gu Qingyu's determined look, Mo Bai blinked curiously.</p>
 <p>"Let's compete!" Gu Qingyu felt like he was digging her own grave even further.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>What other choice do I have? Sometimes life's a bitch and then you keep living.</em></p>
 <p>Mo Bai looked at Gu Qingyu and nodded solemnly. "Okay."</p>
 <p>"There's not enough space here." Gu Qingyu jumped out of the window. "Come out."</p>
 <p>After she landed smoothly on the ground, Mo Bai followed. His boots landed on the ground steadily, and the orange glow of the setting sun spattered on his white robe. He looked like he came out from a painting.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The jade flute on Mo Bai's hand was raised slightly, it glowed strangely against the setting sun.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai smiled softly. "Yu'er, let's get started."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded, but she didn't dare to underestimate her opponent. The Soul Chain gradually appeared around her.</p>
 <p><em>There is no way I’m using the Soul Nails against Mo Bai. That kind of weapon is reserved for powerful enemies. The key word is not powerful, but enemy.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu controlled the Soul Chain with her mind, and the Soul Chain flew to Mo Bai.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai tilted sideways, but the Soul Chain turned around in the air and struck Mo Bai directly.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai jumped up, his white robe danced through the air, and Soul Chain missed him by centimeters. Then, he landed gracefully on his feet. He seemed almost bored, as though he had simply broken a porcelain cup by accident. But that was impossible.</p>
 <p>He sent the jade flute flying towards Gu Qingyu. She was cautious and grabbed the jade flute with the chain as opposed to dodging that attack. The jade flute was entangled by the Soul Chain and could not move, but Mo Bai seemed unfazed.</p>
 <p>His white sleeve waved gently, as if he wanted to wipe off the dust on something. The jade flute immediately turned into a pool of water, and dripped softly from the chain to the ground.</p>
 <p>The water quickly disappeared into the grass. Gu Qingyu looked at Mo Bai in surprise. He extended his hand again, and a water droplet slowly rose from the ground near his feet. The second and the third droplet appeared, the water converged at the palm of his hand. Eventually, the water formed the shape of a flute, he closed his hand, and the flute turned solid, it was the same jade flute.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Woah, that looks amazing!" Gu Qingyu sighed in admiration.</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, now is not the time to praise." Mo Bai smiled slightly, "Be careful."</p>
 <p>She refocused after his kind reminder. Then, the ground beneath her feet shook, and a wave swelled from the ground and swept towards her. That's right, it was a wave!</p>
 <p>Her mind blanked, and instinctively, she used the Soul Chain to form a make-shift wave breaker.</p>
 <p>The waves smashed against the wave breaker and it rattled heavily at the impact. But that at least stopped the wave.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Mo Bai is actually this powerful…&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu instantly realised she had profoundly understood the true meaning of the meme "No Zuo No Die" through her own personal experience.</p>
 <p><em>However, in hindsight, I should not have cried then. It was too early, far too early.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned around and found that while she was occupied, a giant tsunami had formed behind her. It towered above her and was about to come crashing down. She turned around to escape, but the wave breaker that she had made with the Soul Chain had blocked her path.</p>
 <p>She squeezed her eyes shut and braced for impact.</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Unlike what she imagined, it did not hurt, nor did she find it hard to breathe. She was not underwater at all, something warm was wrapped around her instead. There was a light fragrance of medicinal herbs, it was Mo Bai.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, be careful." Mo Bai sighed softly as he stroked her head.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded, her hands winded around him and she patted him on the back. "Thank you Mo Bai! I really learned a lot today!"</p>
 <p>Mo Bai released her and showed her another tender smile. "Let's head inside."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled and walked into the castle with Mo Bai. Qi Wan and Qi Yichen were snacking on sunflower seeds at the lobby. Qi Wan spat out a pair of husks when Gu Qingyu and Mo Bai walked in. "Welcome, join the dead."</p>
 <p>"Thank you." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and held out her hand. As if on autopilot, Qi Wan grabbed a handful of sunflower seeds from Qi Yichen's sleeve and put them in Gu Qingyu's hands. Gu Qingyu nodded with satisfaction, while Qi Yichen glared at Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>"Right, where's Xiao Qi?" Gu Qingyu suddenly realised that she had not seen Xiao Qi anywhere. <em>Xiao Qi is missing!</em></p>
