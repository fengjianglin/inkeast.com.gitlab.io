 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu turned back immediately and peeked over his shoulder, “What are you buying?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a waterskin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eighty bronze coins.” The waterskin vendor was a middle-aged woman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe furrowed his brows, “A waterskin is that expensive?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see, this must be your first time on this street, young man.” The woman started rambling, “Let me tell you, okay, on this street, okay, my goods are the cheapest, okay, and also the best, got it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The best?” Gu Qingyu picked up one of the waterskins. “You call this the best? What in the world! What is this low quality! I can tell its material by just touching! Here, feel it!” She held the waterskin closer to the woman, “Look at the cheap material it’s made of! You’re telling me this is worth eighty copper coins?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu tossed the waterskin back and pulled on Jia Qizhe’s arm. “I’d rather pay more than buy one of your cheap and low-quality waterskins. We’re leaving, brother Jia!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, you...” The woman had clearly lost confidence in her items. “How can you just...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu pulled Jia Qizhe a few small steps away, “We should tell the others to not come down here to buy things from her. Let’s get out of here——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Stop! Fifty!” The woman clenched her teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thirty.” Gu Qingyu took a step back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe said expressionlessly, “Twenty.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Mommy! He’s way more ruthless than me!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The woman glare at them, “You... whatever, I’ll let you have it for twenty. Just don’t ever come back here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay~” Gu Qingyu turned inward and secretly laughed.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What a great bargain! I don’t think we’ll ever come back anyway!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you so much!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The look Jia Qizhe gave her said it all, and Gu Qingyu felt even more pleased with herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long, the goods slowly and gradually piled up in their bags as they wandered through the crowded street markets, shopping and bargaining. Though, Jia Qizhe carried most of it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They saved on quite a few silver taels because Gu Qingyu managed to cut down the asking prices to the minimum on the most of the items after bargaining.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whole time, Jia Qizhe had a slight smile on his lips as he walked in front. “I never thought it’d be so useful to bring you out together for shopping.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. Don’t forget who I am.” All Gu Qingyu could think about was returning to the inn, “Walk faster~”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why the rush?” For the first time in a while, Jia Qizhe actually felt curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu could only roll her eyes, “Stupid, did you already forget that I asked Qi Yichen to bring back goodies? If we’re back late, the hot snacks like steamed buns and roasted chestnuts will get cold——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe stopped suddenly, causing Gu Qingyu to bump into his back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Owww!” She rubbed her head, “What are you doing——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe turned around and looked at her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“W-what is it?” said Gu Qingyu panicky. His look made her feel guilty, for some reason.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m hungry,” he said with a serious face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” She tilted her head and looked at him with wide eyes. “Whaddya say? Are you mad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am hungry,” he said again. “Let’s have a couple meat buns before we go back.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...??” She looked at him in disbelief, “You sure?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He nodded, then walked up to the tiny steamed bun stall on the side of the street. “Boss, when will the steamed buns be ready?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You came just in time!” The owner opened the cover, the gorgeous buns were all steaming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then give me five of those.” Jia Qizhe pointed at the meat-filled buns.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Five?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Here you go! It’ll be 5 copper coins!” The owner put five meat-filled buns on a large leaf and handed it over to Jia Qizhe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe gave the owner the coins in return and then handed the large leaf over to Gu Qingyu. “You can eat first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, everything was clear to her. Jia Qizhe wasn’t hungry at all, he only said that as an excuse to buy the meat buns for her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Well, okay, I shall consider this his atonement and forgive him! Ehm... I don’t think he has done anything that needs forgiving...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded, and accepted it from him, then took out two, one which she held out to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe didn’t take it, he just looked at her confusedly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take it. Weren’t you hungry?” She nudged his arm and smiled, “At least, one?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if he bought them for me, wouldn’t it be rude if I finished all of them?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He finally accepted it. “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re most welcome~” She looked at the piping hot food and took a big bite ravenously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe suddenly inserted the whole meat bun in his mouth and began digging in his bag.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu looked at him as she took another large bite.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Ah, how cute... like the chubby cheeks of a squirrel!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He finally brought out a ribbon from his bag. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is...” Gu Qingyu stared at the ribbon in his hand. It was a beautiful, light blue silk ribbon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe stepped behind her and began fiddling with her hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She wanted to stop him, but she didn’t want to move as to not mess up her ‘handsome’ hairstyle. “Heey, Jia Qizhe! What are you doing!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring her protests, Jia Qizhe continued fiddling. Finally, he let down his hands and turned her around. He looked at her as if he was admiring an artwork.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu quickly opened her bag and took out a mirror, which she bought earlier at a low price, and checked her hair——</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blue ribbon was tied in a pretty bow, adorning a section of her hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She looked up at Jia Qizhe with narrowed eyes, “You bought this for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah...” he hesitated. “I was thinking of buying either those yellow earrings or that bracelet you were interested in, but then neither of them would match your current appearance. This was the least conspicuous item I could find... You’ve worked hard today. Treat it as a reward,” he seemed out of it, talking incoherently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pffft——” Gu Qingyu laughed. “Got it. Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This is the first time I’ve seen him acting so bashful.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“...” He let out a smile and started walking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their shadows gradually grew longer as the sun descended gradually toward the horizon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oi, I’m still eating——! Can you stop walking so fast all the time! Jia Qizhe! Waaaaaait————”</span></p>
