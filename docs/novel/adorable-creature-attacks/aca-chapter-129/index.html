 <p>Gu Qingyu watched in horror as Ye Jin was curled up on the ground as the dark mist encapsulated him. He was in so much pain, and she could still hear his soft whimpers. "Xiao Yu'er... Xiao Yu'er... My Xiao Yu'er... "</p>
 <p>Tears sprang to her eyes and she yelled, "Xiao Zhezhe!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The man in the black gas flinched and ran over to her at the sound of her voice. In that moment, darkness faded away, revealing Ye Jin as he ran towards her and wrapped her up in a tight embrace. "Xiao Yu'er!"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe!" Gu Qingyu also hugged him tightly, her voice came out as sobs, "Sorry! I'm sorry, I'm late. I caused you so much pain!"</p>
 <p>"No, I should apologise. I didn't rescue you in time." Ye Jin bent down slightly, his chin resting on her shoulder, "Xiao Yu'er, I'm really afraid of losing you..."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The dark mist faded slowly, and Qi Yichen, who just rushed over, let out a sigh of relief. His tightly gripped hands finally loosened, revealing a slight bruise and clammy palms. Thank goodness he made the right call, or he would never forgive himself. Xie Zang and Murong Zuoyu silently released their shields and stepped aside.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, are you hurt?" Ye Jin leaned back and looked at her. Gu Qingyu shook her head, as she continued to sob. <em>I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. You must have been so anxious and worried. And you must have been in so much pain. This is all my fault.</em></p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, don't cry. They must have hurt you." Ye Jin gently stroked her hair. "I will not let go of any single one of them."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu dried her eyes and looked up at him. "I've finished off Gu Yan, who else is left?"</p>
 <p>Ye Jin gently brushed away the tear streaks on her face. After a while, he slowly answered, "Xian Di."</p>
 <p>"It's him again?" Gu Qingyu sighed. "Will he ever leave us alone?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Ye Jin nodded and looked at her with worry. "Xiao Yu'er, let's go. I won't leave you anymore."</p>
 <p>"Mm." Gu Qingyu's eyes were red and puffy, and she lowered her head in embarrassment.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Yichen, who had been waiting for them, opened his fan and clicked his tongue. "Brother Zhu, it's rare to see you blushing~"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu glared at him. "Qi Yichen, I don't mind helping you forget what you just saw. So are you going to do it yourself? Or would you like me to assist you? I'm sure Ye Jin would be glad to lend a hand as well."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen choked, and then laughed nervously. "Ah, haha, Brother Zhu, don't jest. I didn't see anything at all!"</p>
 <p>"Ah, good." Gu Qingyu nodded at his reply.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Suddenly, there was a slight rustling nearby. and Gu Qingyu whipped around, and sent out the Soul Chain.</p>
 <p>"It's me!" Qi Wan stood up as he rubbed his head. "Ow, that hurt."</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan?" Gu Qingyu immediately withdrew her weapon. She still felt bad for reacting the way she did, he only wanted the best for her, but she was so obstinate that Qi Yichen had to step in and knock him out.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What are you doing?" Qi Wan let out a grunt and turned away. "I am actually angry this time."</p>
 <p>Ye Jin's eyes sank, and Gu Qingyu gave his hand a squeeze before she smiled sweetly at Qi Wan. "Aww, don't be like that, Xiao Wanwan, it's not good for your health to be angry anyway~"</p>
 <p>"Hmph."Qi Wan turned to look at her. "If it had been you, would you be angry?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu went silent. Yeah, if it was just Qi Wan's beloved one who was in trouble, and things were as precarious as just now, she would have knocked him out and dragged him away immediately.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At this moment, a black aura was slowly formed in the open space in front of Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"What's the matter?" Gu Qingyu stepped back two steps, "Xiao Zhezhe, your Frost Poison?"</p>
 <p>"No. I was just like that because someone forced the Frost Poison to activate and I lost control." Ye Jin lowered his eyes, "But that's not Xian Di."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Indeed, Xian Di had a habit of striking from surprise. He would not slowly appear right in front of them. The black aura gradually formed into a person. The mysterious individual was covered in a black cloak, and wore a wide-brimmed hat of the same colour. The brim was so wide it obscured his face. "I haven't seen you in a long time, Gu Qingyu," the man raised his head slightly and made a hoarse voice, but to her, it sounded very familiar."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's heart jolted. "It's you!" The person that killed her! Qi Wan and Ye Jin were both alarmed as well.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Boss, looks like we've got some old company." Qi Wan stepped forward and stood side by side with Gu Qingyu, lifting his chin slightly. "Old man, since you've gone through so much effort to send us here, save yourself the energy and just let us stay in this world without any trouble."</p>
 <p>"No," the man laughed. "You have caused quite a bit of trouble already."</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen silently put away his fan, but he was surprised. Gu Qingyu was not someone from their world. He has heard claims, but he was not certain about the credibility of those claims. He has looked into her life path as well, there was a sudden, inevitable event that transformed her previously-uneventful life. That discovery stuck out to him, but it was only speculation on his part, but it looked like his speculation and those claims he once heard, were all true. Murong Zuoyu kept his eyes focused, but he was puzzled. <em>What does it mean? In this world? Isn't she someone from this world?</em> On the other hand, Xie Zang was smiling. It seemed that his kitten still had a lot of secrets...</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"What do you want?" Gu Qingyu stared at him coldly, and cut to the chase. "And why did you send me to this world?"</p>
 <p>The mysterious man shrugged. "How do you know that this world wasn't your world? I'll be honest, White Tiger, I was just doing my job and sent you back to the world where you belong."</p>
 <p>"What about me?" Qi Wan narrowed his eyes slightly. "Oh, man, am I a divine beast too? Or maybe one of the divine?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No," the mysterious man laughed. "Oh, you're nothing. But, you were the guardian of divine beasts in your past life. We need you to awake the divine beast."</p>
 <p>"Are you done talking?" Ye Jin slowly gathered blue light in his hands, "Because if you are done, you can go now."</p>
 <p>"I'm done. But, are you the one she loves, Shadow?" The mysterious man stretched out his hands, the flesh on his limbs was rotten. Black light gathered in his hands.</p>
 <p>Right then, Ye Jin stumbled to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe!" Gu Qingyu was taken aback, and the Soul Chain appeared. It encircled her, ready to pierce through the mysterious man in an instant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You have grown a lot, Gu Qingyu." That man tilted his head. &nbsp;"But, I can control the Frost Poison. If I willed it, Ye Jin could die in the next second."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You!" Gu Qing's eyes narrowed, but she didn't dare to act. He was not kidding. The Frost Poison that was gradually seeping out from Ye Jin was sufficient proof that he was capable of controlling it. Ye Jin's life was in his hands.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, I'm fine." Ye Jin closed his eyes slightly and pushed himself up despite the torrent of pain inside him. Blue light gathered in his hand and formed Ghost Howl.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't force yourself!" Gu Qingyu nibbled on her lips as she watched him with worry. She turned to the intruder. "What the hell do you want?"</p>
 <p>Faint red light gathered in Xie Zang’s hands.</p>
 <p>"Lord of Xie Li Castle, I would advise you to keep your hands where they are." The intruder tilted his head and looked at him. "Is she more important than your sister?"</p>
 <p>The red light on the Xie Zang hand suddenly vanished, and his face stiffened slightly. "What did you say?"</p>
 <p>“She’s very adorable, rather trusting too. Her disease may have been cured, but she is quite frail." The black robe tilted his head. "What do you think I’m talking about?"</p>
 <p>"Asshole." Xie Zang took two steps back.</p>
 <p>"Oh, and you." The black robe looked at Murong Zuoyu. "Except for your Brother Zhu, the person you care about the most should be your actual brother?"</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu's eyes sank. "What did you do to Ranyue?" Murong Ranyue was his brother of the same mother and father.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The man smiled and didn't answer, but looked at Gu Qingyu. "Now, I think we can finally have a conversation." Qi Yichen was not mentioned at all, because he was not seen as a threat. He had lost his powers after all.</p>
 <p>As soon as Qi Wan took the first two steps and tried to close in to him, the man said with a hoarse voice. "Guardian of the divine beasts. With so many lives at stake, surely you would not do something so reckless.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan huffed, Gu Qingyu held out her arm and stopped him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What do you want?" She clenched her fist.</p>
 <p>The man in black walked towards her. "It is said that the heart of the White Tiger is more precious than all the other divine beasts. It is precisely because of its divine power that it can reign above all creatures.”</p>
 <p>"Got it." Gu Qingyu nodded, she faced him without fear. &nbsp;"Can you let go of Xie Li, Murong Ranyue and Ye Jin?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, no..." Ye Jin said immediately, but before he finished speaking, blood spat out from his lips again.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe!" Gu Qingyu steeled her nerves and answered. "You have a deal."</p>
 <p>"Don't, Boss!" Qi Wan immediately grabbed Gu Qingyu's hand.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook it off, her eyes filled with quiet resolve. “Qi Wan, don't stop it."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan gritted his teeth. "Do you think he would let go of Ye Jin if you gave him your heart? What if he goes back on his word?"</p>
 <p>"We don't have a choice." Gu Qingyu suddenly smiled. "Thank you, Qi Wan."</p>
 <p>She turned to the mysterious man.</p>
 <p>"Xiao...Yu'er...no...you...can't..." Ye Jin's voice was barely a whisper.</p>
 <p>The man held out his hand and his voice was full of greed. "Come, give me your heart."</p>
