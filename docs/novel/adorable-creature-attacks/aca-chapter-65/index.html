 <p>Gu Qingyu turned away and looked up at the sky, as laughter threatened to bubble out of her chest and a smile almost split across her face. Xiao Qi happened to join them at that moment, and Sha Wukong's wife also came out from the kitchen with a few bowls of millet porridge. Gu Qingyu dashed to her seat at the table. "Thank you for your hospitality!" Forgive her, she simply could not stand that group anymore!</p>
 <p>"You're welcome, hurry, and eat!" The lady of the house gave her a friendly smile.</p>
 <p>The others also sat down, one after another. Gu Qingyu beamed at Sha Wukong and his wife. "Thank you for your hospitality! We will resume our journey after breakfast."</p>
 <p>"Okay." The woman nodded and smiled gently.</p>
 <p>After their meal, the couple personally sent Gu Qingyu and others to the village entrance.</p>
 <p>"Have a safe trip!" Sha Wukong waved at them.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stepped forward and tried to stuff some money into Sha Wukong's hand. Sha Wukong immediately stepped back. "I can't take it! I can't take it!"</p>
 <p>"Why not? Brother Sha, I don't mean anything else, but I can't accept your kindness for nothing!" Gu Qingyu frowned. "We're really grateful for your help, this is the least that I can do to give back."</p>
 <p>"We don't need the money. Just remember," Sha Wukong smiled. "Remember how others have helped you, and then carry it forward and help other people. This is all taught by the Prime Minister! "</p>
 <p>"The Prime Minister?" Gu Qingyu blinked, and she became more curious about this Prime Minister.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah, let's go." The lady gave Gu Qingyu a smile. "Come by again some time!"</p>
 <p>"We will!" Gu Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They bid farewell to the village and continued their journey.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"There's no way we will be as lucky as last time!" Gu Qingyu nibbled on a foxtail with slight frustration. "Say, will the King of Xiqian give us the Spirit Gem so easily?"</p>
 <p>"Maybe," Qi Wan also held a foxtail in his mouth. "The Prime Minister sounds kind and generous, and obviously the king listens to everything the Prime Minister says, so as long as we could crack the Prime Minister..."</p>
 <p>"Hm... Well said!" Gu Qingyu nodded approvingly.</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen waved his fan. "This Prime Minister is rumored to be like an immortal sage, no known interests or desires. Just how do you plan to crack him?"</p>
 <p>"Now that, is where you are wrong." Gu Qingyu gave him a side-eye. "He is also human, everyone has weaknesses. Even if he doesn't indulge in the seven sins, there must be some vice we could leverage on. There's always more than meets the eye, Qi Yichen. The more virtuous they appear, the harder they fall."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Eh? Really?" Qi Yichen blinked and closed his fan awkwardly.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded with a look of agreement and admiration. "That's right! Boss, you can always see the heart of the problem at a glance!"</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen thought to himself, <em>“you don't have to be so obvious with the flattery.”&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu grinned as she pointed at Qi Wan. "And you can see my heart at a glance."</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe scoffed. "I can too."</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu flinched, then shook her head. "It seems that I'm old, I can't even hear well!"</p>
 <p>"No, in fact, you are kind and beautiful," Jia Qizhe said against his conscience.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately covered her face. "Aww~~"</p>
 <p>Her response sent a tingle along Mo Bai's scalp. "Yu'er, you are beautiful, you just don't realise it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh, stop it!" Gu Qingyu stomped. "All of you are so sweet and honest today!"</p>
 <p>Everyone collectively decided to drop the subject.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They arrived at a city as the sky darkened.</p>
 <p>"Where is this?" Gu Qingyu looked at the map on her hand, "City of Pears?" She looked at Jia Qizhe curiously, "Hero Jia, you're quite well-traveled, is there a City of Apples?"</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe thought for a while and then nodded. "There should be one in Nanyou."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu continued as she tried to hold in her laughter."What about the Grape city, Peach City, or even Watermelon City?"</p>
 <p>"Grape City is in Dongxuan, Peach City is in Beiying. I haven't heard of Watermelon City." Jia Qizhe looked serious. "Little Yu'er, since you're so well-read, where is Watermelon City?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Ah! It lives in my heart forever!"</p>
 <p>"Urgh, just keep walking." Xie Zang walked into the city, it seemed that he had lost his patience.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu trailed behind him. "Yo, Uncle Xie Zang, what's going on today?"</p>
 <p>"I don't know why, but I always get goosebumps when I'm around you guys." Xie Zang smiled. "Kitten, would you help me scratch it?"</p>
 <p>"N-no need, walk slowly, don't fall..." Gu Qingyu nodded and kept walking. "This is the City of Pears, it is also a military outpost. We'll follow the usual routine, acquire horses and head straight to the Imperial City, okay?"</p>
 <p>"No problem!" Qi Wan agreed first.</p>
 <p>"Oh! Qi Wan, do you have any friends running a racecourse here?" Gu Qingyu asked.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was stunned, he immediately shook his head. Of course not, there is no way he's losing a friend again!</p>
 <p>"How about a restaurant?" Gu Qingyu asked again.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan shook his head again. Of course not, bankrupting one restaurant is enough. How many restaurants do you want me to go bankrupt?</p>
 <p>"Do you still want to live?" Gu Qingyu asked as she nodded.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan shook his head habitually. Of course not...</p>
 <p>"I want to live!" He looked up immediately.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled with satisfaction. "Well, it's good to know that you cherish your life."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Wan thought on his feet and pointed at an inn in front of them. "It's getting late today, let's go to this inn to take a break!"</p>
 <p>"Good idea!" Gu Qingyu nodded and stepped in.</p>
 <p>There, an innkeeper welcomed them as soon as he saw Qi Wan. "Good to see you, boss! Business has been good today. Huh, why do you keep blinking your eyes? Did you get sand stuck in your eyes? You look really uncomfortable right now."</p>
 <p>"Eh ha ha ha, you're the owner?" Gu Qingyu chuckled coldly and she slowly turned to Qi Wan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A shiver went down his spine, Qi Wan met her eyes and swallowed thickly. "Boss, I can explain ..."</p>
 <p>"You have one chance, is four words is enough for you to explain?" Gu Qingyu’s eyes were unflinching.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan choked. "I offer my life!"</p>
 <p>"Offer accepted!" Gu Qingyu clapped. "Jia Qizhe, Mo Bai, go!" Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai looked at Gu Qinyu in unison, one of them had a playful look and the other had a look of astonishment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Uh, sorry, I seem to be used to it." Gu Qingyu scratched her head sheepishly. "I'll do it myself!" She rolled up her sleeves.</p>
 <p>"Ehhhhhhh! Boss! Chill, chill! You just rest up today! Tomorrow, everything will be ready for you. Not a single cent!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan immediately shielded his face." But if you really want to beat me up, please just avoid my handsome and handsome face! Although it is only the second handsome, it is never as handsome as yours, Boss! "</p>
 <p>"Well," Gu Qingyu nodded with satisfaction and withdrew her hand. "Excellent! Then I shall head to bed?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, please!" Or else, Qi Wan would be waving a white flag.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Come on, remember to call me for dinner!" Gu Qingyu smiled, waved and went upstairs.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As soon as she went upstairs, Gu Qingyu looked at her dusty appearance and planned to take a bath first. She told someone to bring a set of clothes and towels, prepared a bucket of hot water, and took off her clothes and slipped into the bath.</p>
 <p>Yan Zun slowly floated into the room. Gu Qingyu panicked at the sight of his red robes and immediately buried herself in the water. The hot water made her take a sharp breath. "Master! It's not funny! Go back! "</p>
 <p>"Do you think I won't be able to see anything from the inside?" Yan Zun took out a small bottle from his sleeve, then opened the bottle slowly, and poured a strange liquid into the wooden bathtub. The bath water turned red in an instant.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qing stunned, looking at Yan Zun puzzledly. "Master, what are you doing?"</p>
 <p>"This is Duan Gu, or Bone Breaker. It can make people reborn... In short, it can make your body movement more flexible, soften up your joints."</p>
 <p>"That's really a good thing!" Gu Qingyu watched the red liquid &nbsp;slowly dissolve. "Master, can you go now?"</p>
 <p>"Don't be in such a hurry, this medicine has a hypnotic effect. I'm staying to keep watch, or you'll fall asleep in the bath and drown yourself." Yan Zun was calm and calm.</p>
 <p>"Master!" Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "You don't have to look at it that way? You can go to the spiritual world ..."</p>
 <p>"Since you have said it in good faith, then I'll take my leave." Yan Zun was also very cooperative, nodded, and disappeared, leaving one last advice. "Be careful. Even in the spiritual world, I can see it too..."</p>
 <p>"I didn't expect you to be like that, Master." Gu Qingyu pouted, looking at the red water, but really felt an unspeakable feeling all over her body.</p>
 <p><em>I feel that my bones are slowly getting lighter, and was I always this sleepy?</em></p>
 <p>"Stupid apprentice," Yan Zun's words came from the spiritual world, "Didn't I tell you to be careful?"</p>
 <p><em>Be careful...</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu let out a dry laugh as she began to channel her energy and let the water into her body.</p>
 <p>Suddenly, someone knocked on the door.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, it's me." Xiao Qi's weak voice came.</p>
 <p>"Wait a moment, I'm taking a bath." Gu Qingyu hid behind the screen and said.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi nodded. "Okay, I'll help you guard the door."</p>
 <p>In this way, Gu Qingyu felt relieved and focused. Bone Breaker was really helpful, it didn’t take long for the exhaustion from the few days on the road to leave her body. Her body felt light and tension had left all of her joints.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After bathing, she changed into her new clothes, emptied the bath, and opened the door. Xiao Qi was at the door, her hand was raised, as if she was just about to call her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Gu Qingyu asked. "Is there anything urgent?"</p>
 <p>"Eh? Why do you mean? Xiao Yu, I just came up here. Dinner is ready." Xiao Qi was also confused, but her confusion was clearly genuine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu then realised, Xiao Yu'er, Xiao Yu.</p>

 <p>So Little Yu’er is phonetically Xiao Yu’er. In the beginning, I went with Little Yu’er to make a stronger distinction between the various nicknames Gu Qingyu has amassed. It’s quite obvious that I missed out on this part, in which Gu Qingyu herself mixes up the nicknames. Thus, to keep things flowing, Little Yu’er would now be changed to Xiao Yu’er. &nbsp;Just a refresher, here’s the list of nicknames for Gu Qingyu:&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Yu, by Xiao Qi</p>
 <p>Yu’er, by Mo Bai,&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Little Yu’er, now Xiao Yu’er, by Jia Qizhe&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Stupid/Slowpoke/Dumb Apprentice, by Yan Zun</p>
