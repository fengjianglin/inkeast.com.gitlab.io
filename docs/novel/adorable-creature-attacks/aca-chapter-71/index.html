 <p>"The King of Xiqian has been killed, Xiqian would soon be in chaos." Murong Zuoyu frowned as he carefully phrased his query.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Does this have anything to do with us?" Gu Qingyu smiled easily. "We're just visitors, tourists from another country. After Qi Yichen wakes up, let's go back to the village at the border and visit Wukong."</p>
 <p>"Okay, Master!" Qi Wan bowed with his palms held together. Xiao Qi, who had just walked downstairs, cringed at that sight.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Sure enough, as Murong Zuoyu predicted, news of the murder of the King of Xiqian had spread through the city. For better or worse, it was what everyone had talked about all day.</p>
 <p>That was how Gu Qingyu heard about actually. She was shopping with Jia Qizhe and Qi Wan when they heard the news. Although, to be precise, Jia Qizhe and Qi Wan were shopping with her. Gu Qingyu just finished eating a stick of candied hawthorns, she held out her hand to Qi Wan and Qi Wan immediately handed another stick of candied hawthorns. He carried a straw bundle on his shoulders, sticks of candied hawthorns were stuck into the straw bundle like porcupine spines.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan wanted to cry without tears. "Boss, isn't it too sweet?"<em>&nbsp;I really don't get girls, even badass girls like you.</em></p>
 <p>"Of course it's too sweet." Gu Qingyu held out her hand to Jia Qizhe. Jia Qizhe handed out a piece of salted rice cake and put it in Gu Qingyu's hand. She popped the whole cake into her mouth and replied with a slightly muffled voice, "See? Not too sweet anymore."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan waved his hand weakly. "I take back what I just said ..." <em>What little girl? What badass girl? She's just a badass, nothing else.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"Oh," Gu Qingyu turned to Jia Qizhe. "Xiao Zhezhe!"</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe seemed to enjoy this nickname very much. "What is it, Xiao Yu'er?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu batted her eyelashes as she stared at him with wide, innocent eyes. "Look at the girls! All of them look pretty and beautiful! Can I..."</p>
 <p>"No." Jia Qizhe shot her down before she could even finish her sentence.</p>
 <p>"Dammit!" Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes, recomposed herself and tried again, dragging out each word this time. "Xiaozhezhe~ Zhezhe~ Zhe~"</p>
 <p>"Okay, you can buy it." Jia Qizhe relented with a wave.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Yes, success!&nbsp;</em>"Thank you Xiao Zhezhe!" Gu Qingyu smiled and pulled Jia Qizhe and Qi Wan to a clothing store. Qi Wan looked at the goosebumps on his arms, then he looked at Jia Qizhe's threatening expression. He swallowed thickly and kept all of his complaints.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>At the clothing store</strong></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe shoved Gu Qingyu directly to the shopkeeper, who was a middle-aged lady. "Please, make a set of dresses for her." As he spoke, he handed her a piece of gold.</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper hurried to take it, and then made a very classic action-she nibbled on the gold. Then she nodded with a beaming smile. "Very well, sir! The clothes in this shop will definitely please you!" She was very excited, the shopkeeper looked at Gu Qingyu as though she was a goose who would lay golden eggs.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu winced as she sighed. "Jia Qizhe, seriously?... Hey, don't drag me-ow! Qi Wan, help!" She trailed off as the passionate shopkeeper pulled her into a room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan dabbed his forehead as the two men watched Gu Qingyu disappear into the room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The shopkeeper shut the door as soon as Gu Qingyu entered the room. She stared at her with a slight flush and stomped twice. "Sir, I will now begin to take your measurements."</p>
 <p>"Call me Miss, thank you." Gu Qingyu corrected calmly as she looked at the shopkeeper. Sure enough, the shopkeeper was stunned, her eyes scanned Gu Qingyu from the top of her head to the tip of her toes. "Will you please hurry up?" Gu Qingyu smiled.</p>
 <p>"Of course, no problem, Miss!" The shopkeeper took out a measuring tape. "What colour would you prefer, Miss?"</p>
 <p>"Huh..." Gu Qingyu pondered. &nbsp;"Pink."</p>
 <p><em>Yes, of course, bright colours are always nice. And pink is quite feminine, and it would not match with any of their colours, so that would minimise conflict as well…&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu sighed. She has to be careful, even if it was just picking out something to wear.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper concurred. &nbsp;"Yes, good color!" She took Gu Qingyu's measurements, and soon she was free to walk out. The shopkeeper followed her out and nodded to Jia Qizhe. "Everything's done, sir! Come by and pick up the dresses tomorrow!"</p>
 <p>"So fast?" Gu Qingyu turned to the shopkeeper with a questioning look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper nodded immediately. "Of course! Why would there be any delay for an esteemed guest as you!" &nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>......This is really a capitalistic society. &nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu sighed and waved weakly. "Off you go then!"</p>
 <p>"What's wrong, Boss? Are you not happy about the clothes?" &nbsp;Qi Wan asked.</p>
 <p>"No, I'm very happy." Gu Qingyu nodded, yet she had a melancholic look. "I just thought of some things..."</p>
 <p>"Boss, don't give up hope!" Qi Wan mirrored her expression. "You must know that there are so many see through today, and there are many more you have not seen through waiting for you to see through!"</p>
 <p>"You can stop now." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and resumed her snacking of candied hawthorns and salted rice cakes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After returning to the inn, Gu Qingyu went straight to Mo Bai's room. He smiled when he saw her. "If nothing goes awry, I think he will wake up tonight."</p>
 <p>"Thank you Mo Bai! You're really an amazing doctor!" Gu Qingyu praised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>That moment when the dagger pierced Qi Yichen's chest, Gu Qingyu really thought he was going to die.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I really didn't expect Mo Bai to be so powerful ... Well, after all, he is a "healer", his skill in healing spells was astonishing, it would not be a stretch to call it "resurrection". Not even modern medicine could do that.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Mo Bai shook his head. "It's just that there can be no more stimulation. He would be quite weak for a while, and he would no longer be able to use magic."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Well, as long as he's alive." Gu Qingyu nodded. "Mo Bai, let's go eat."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"How does your arm feel?" Mo Bai changed the topic as he glanced at her arm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Huh? I can't feel the pain anymore..." Gu Qingyu blinked. "It's amazing!"</p>
 <p>And yet, he frowned lightly. "Can't feel pain?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, what's wrong?" His brows were furrowed, it confused her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It should not be this soon. It would be normal for you to feel a slight pain in the morning, but not completely.“ Mo Bai looked into her eyes. ”Did they poison you?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Well, parasites actually, according to Qi Yichen and Zhi Wei." Gu Qingyu continued her explanation. "But it should have been removed when Qi Yichen cut my arm..." <em>Otherwise, why would Zhi Wei fail that time?</em></p>
 <p>That surprised Mo Bai. "Yu'er, give me your arm, now!" He sounded anxious, but still gentle. His voice sent a warm fuzzy feeling straight to her chest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" She held out her hand obediently, pulled up her sleeve and rested it on Mo Bai's palm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Mo Bai took out a leaf. "Yu'er, this might hurt a little."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It's okay." Gu Qingyu looked at the leaf, but smiled.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai's hand flicked past her arm quickly. Her arm seemed fine, but slowly, a thin line of black blood oozed out from her arm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Woah!&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu cried, tears sprang out from her eyes as she panicked. "Ah! I'm bleeding!"</p>
 <p>"Yu'er?" Mo Bai was frightened. "It should not hurt."</p>
 <p>"Yeah! But it's still scary!" Gu Qingyu cried even more fiercely as she watched the black blood that kept flowing out of her arm.</p>
 <p>"Don't cry." Mo Bai gently stroked her forehead. "Are you scared?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "Of course I'm scared!"</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, I'm here, it's okay." Mo Bai smiled softly, his sleeve gently wiped away her tears that she squeezed from dramatic effect.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu grabbed his sleeves and was about to rub it all over her face. &nbsp;But he was still watching, so she let go of his sleeve instead and wiped her face with the back of her hand. "I'm fine now."&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Are all girls like that, tears come and go like pages in a book?</em></p>
 <p>"Alright. Although the parasites have been removed, the poison from the parasites has not yet dissipated. If we did not discover it early, I'm afraid that the poison would have spread further. Yu'er, pay more attention next time." There was a little anger mixed in his words, but there was still a trace of tenderness. It was such a contrasting tone that Gu Qingyu chuckled softly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You can still laugh at this?" He seemed worried.</p>
 <p>She gradually stopped her laughing. "Okay, okay, I know!"</p>
 <p>The black blood had finally stopped, Mo Bai gently lifted her hand to check. He nodded after a close inspection. "It looks much better now." His hand lightly touched the wound, and the wound closed without a scar. Mo Bai pulled down Gu Qingyu's sleeve. Right then, someone pushed open the door.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Wan broke in with a look of excitement, his mouth was open, as if he wanted to say something. But he stopped when he saw Gu Qingyu's slightly red and puffy eyes, and Mo Bai gently holding her sleeve.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Boss!" Qi Wan immediately ran up, slapped away Mo Bai's hand and pulled Gu Qingyu into his arms. "Jesus! What did he do to you! Don't be afraid, I'm here, I'll help you beat...!"</p>
 <p>He trailed off, Mo Bai's eyes suddenly turned white. Qi Wan swallowed and spat out what was left of his sentence with difficulty but without fear. "Him up!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and shoved Qi Wan away. "My God, what were you thinking?"</p>
 <p>She turned to Mo Bai, and his eyes had returned to normal. He smiled softly at her. &nbsp; "Yu'er, since you are fine, then I will go out first." He got up, his white robe spun around him as he walked out of the room.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned to Qi Wan and shot him a glare. "He's angry now! It's all your fault!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What did I do?" Qi Wan glared back, his face full of shock. "Boss, are you blaming me for spoiling the mood?"</p>
 <p>"Rubbish." Gu Qingyu slowly lowered his sleeve. "You know, I was poisoned. If Mo Bai hadn't discovered it in time, I would have died within the next few hours. Well, Mo Bai's still around, so death might be a stretch. But still!"</p>
 <p>"My bad, Boss..." Qi Wan swallowed weakly.</p>
 <p>"As long as you are willing to correct your mistakes." Gu Qingyu nodded, "So, what did you do wrong?"</p>
 <p>"I should have knocked, and I should have waited until you've finished your business... Boss, calm down and listen to me explain... um... don't come over... Why are you rolling up your sleeves? &nbsp;The weather's really cold too... Can we have a nice little chat instead? Maybe you can put down whatever you are holdin-ah! Aaah!"</p>

 <p>Something lighthearted after the intense angst. Gu Qingyu is really a foodie, candied hawthorns has made an appearance before, but this is the first time salted rice cakes were mentioned. Candied hawthorns are actually a traditional Chinese snack called Tanghulu, it’s kind of like a candy apple, with a thick, hard sugar shell. The hawthorn fruits were normally filled with red bean paste after the pits have been emptied out. Other variations with cherry tomatoes and strawberries are also popular. You can buy it from street vendors, sticks would be stuck into pillars of foam, and you could pick out what you want, but back in the day straw bundles were used instead, hence the detail.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Salted rice cakes are savoury cakes that can be made from a variety of vegetables, like radish or pumpkin. The vegetables are added to rice paste, then steamed to cook and form the shape. The cake can then be eaten on its own, or with a salted-radish topping. You can also fry the cake after steaming it. It’s savoury and a little chewy.&nbsp;</p>
