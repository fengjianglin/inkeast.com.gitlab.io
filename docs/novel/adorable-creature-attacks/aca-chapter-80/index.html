<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>As soon as Gu Qingyu entered the secret tunnel, a strong aroma overwhelmed her senses.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This is the same fragrance I smelled when I first entered the castle…</em></p>
 <p>She held her breath, but Jia Qizhe flicked her forehead. "No need, it's not poisonous."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu released her breath and patted her chest. "You should have said that sooner!"</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe rolled his eyes and the sword in his hand formed again.</p>
 <p>"Could this room be the place that Xie Zang told us to avoid?" She asked as she rubbed the sore spot on her forehead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Jia Qizhe assumed vanguard as always and led the pair further into the tunnel. Eventually, the tunnel opened up to a room.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Suddenly, Gu Qingyu smelled a trace of blood. The sound of coughing followed and bounced across the walls around them. Immediately afterwards, a child-like voice said, "Who are you?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu followed the voice. It was a little girl. The little girl sat on a bed with blood-red sheets, her legs were covered by a quilt, and her hair draped over her shoulders. Her eyes were clear and inquisitive, and she looked at two strangers who suddenly broke in like an ignorant deer. Her legs were not long enough to reach the floor, she dangled them over the edge of the bed as she stared at them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Sorry, we walked in by accident." Gu Qingyu replied. She could at least handle children. After all, she was a psychiatrist, and she used to babysit for her friend.</p>
 <p>She took two steps and took out a piece of candy. "Here, for you. What's your name?"</p>
 <p>The little girl stared at the candy in Gu Qingyu's hands curiously, her hand remained at her side. "My name is Li. What is this? It's so pretty..."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was shocked. <em>She doesn't know what this is?</em></p>
 <p>She was about to explain, but a strong aura came from the tunnel. It was targeted at her and Jia Qizhe, none of the aura reached the girl.</p>
 <p><em>Xie Zang?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned around and saw that Xie Zang zipped through the tunnel.</p>
 <p>He walked straight to the little girl, then turned to look at Gu Qingyu, his eyes were extremely cold. "You have crossed the line, Kitten."</p>
 <p>Her heart stopped for a second, she knew she had stepped on his landmine, so she frantically looked towards Jia Qizhe. Jia Qizhe was calm and collected, and he sent out an aura as well. It encapsulated him and Gu Qingyu, completely blocking the pressurising aura from Xie Zang.</p>
 <p>At this moment, Li broke the standstill. "Older Brother, what are you doing with this lady?"</p>
 <p><em>Older Brother?</em></p>
 <p>At that moment, Xie Zang removed his aura. He knelt down and the siblings' eyes met.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His hands rubbed Li's head lovingly. "Your brother is just playing with this lady, Li should rest well."</p>
 <p>"Li also wants to play..." Xie Li's bright, watery eyes blinked and blinked, she looked adorable.</p>
 <p>"Be good and rest well Li. Once you get better, I'll bring you out to play, ok?" Xie Zang's voice was very gentle.</p>
 <p>Xie Li nodded. "Okay!"</p>
 <p>She lay down obediently, her tiny body slipped under the covers. Xie Zang gently tucked her in. He leaned down slightly, and lightly placed his thin lips on her forehead, like a dragonfly on water. "Good night, Li."</p>
 <p>Xie Li's eyelashes quivered slightly as she closed her eyes. "Good night, brother."</p>
 <p>Xie Zang turned around, Gu Qingyu consciously pulled Jia Qizhe along and they left the room through the tunnel.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>It did not take long for Xie Zang to meet up with them, and the tunnel behind him closed automatically. "Kitten, you are truly vexing."</p>
 <p>He rubbed his forehead and looked at Gu Qingyu with a smile, but the smile did not reach his eyes. Gu Qingyu knew that she really overstepped this time.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Everyone has their own limits. Everything would be fine as long as you leave it alone, but if you break those boundaries, then god knows how things would end up. Li is Xie Zang's younger sister, her name should be Xie Li. Xie Zang's castle was called Xieli Castle, and the city is also full of flowers called Xieli flowers. It is very clear that Xie Zang holds Li dearly in his heart.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"I'm sorry." Gu Qingyu apologised immediately. "I didn't mean to intrude, I just wanted to take a look."</p>
 <p>Based on her knowledge of Xie Zang's personality, he would have scoffed at her, or even mock her. Unexpectedly, Xie Zang just sighed softly. "She is six years old this year."</p>
 <p>"Ah?" Gu Qingyu was stunned for a moment, and did not respond to what he was saying.</p>
 <p>"She is sick. Her illness keeps her in the dark, she can't be exposed to any sunlight. And she only has a year left." Sorrow was evident in his eyes.</p>
 <p><em>There is only one year left... That is to say, that girl, who barely had any time in this world, would die in the next year?</em></p>
 <p>"Is there anything I can do to help?" Gu Qingyu offered. She knew that Xie Zang must have shared this with her precisely because there should be something that she can do. She rather provides assistance immediately than let him to bend his pride and ask her for help.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Zang nodded. "The Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny can cure her."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu never expected that answer. <em>Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny? That is to say, Xie Zang is also after the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny? Is that why he brought us here? He did not bring us here, he kidnapped us! But...</em></p>
 <p>"What, can't bear to part with it?" Xie Zang smiled, that smile was full of sarcasm and a little bit desolate.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook her head. "I want to ask the Lifeblood Jewel about this matter. Will you give me half an hour and a room?"</p>
 <p>Xie Zang nodded and waved his hand, the door on his side opened automatically. Gu Qingyu gripped Jia Qizhe's hand to reassure him, and then walked into the room alone. She sat on the ground and entered the spiritual world.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Yan Zun stood in a fiery red landscape, she could see the horizon behind him. Nothing else was along the landscape, the world around them was just an endless red.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I heard everything." Yan Zun looked at Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"Master, is this true?"</p>
 <p>"If it is true, will you hand me over?" Yan Zun smiled.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and shook her head again. "Only if you consent to it. I'm not going to hand you over if you don't want it."</p>
 <p><em>Although she wanted to save Xie Li, Yan Zun was more important. Even if she likes Xue Li, Yan Zun is inseparable to her. She was no longer the person at the beginning. Someone who was full of innocence and thought she could protect everyone alone. As time went on, she knew she had to decide what to give up. There is no such thing as the best of both worlds, you can't have your cake and eat it. Therefore, Yan Zun is more important than Xie Li.</em></p>
 <p>Yan Zun seemed to understand Gu Qingyu's thoughts, smiled softly, and came over and pressed Gu Qingyu into a tight hug. "It's true. If you want, I can save her."</p>
 <p>A fresh fragrance enveloped her. It is a scent unique to Yan Zun. It smelled like falling into a field of flowers on a cool summer evening.</p>
 <p>"Master..." She could feel that tears had started to build up in her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Is Yan Zun leaving her? Then what does that leave her? She was looking for the Spirit Gems for Yan Zun, and everyone gathered together because of the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny. If Yan Zun leaves, wouldn't that mean everything would fall apart?</em></p>
 <p>"Silly girl." Yan Zun suddenly released her. "Can't bear to see me leave?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded immediately.</p>
 <p>"Then wait for me to come back and cherish me." Yan Zun replied calmly, leaving Gu Qingyu astonished.</p>
 <p>"Come. Back?" Gu Qingyu looked at Yan Zun in disbelief, suddenly she realised that she had been played like a fiddle.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes," Yan Zun smiled lightly. "Do you think I would just sacrifice myself without a second thought? Moreover, there are really only a few things in this world that would be able to cause me to sacrifice myself... Why are your eyes red? "</p>
 <p>"You know why!" Gu Qingyu rubbed her eyes indignantly. <em>This guy definitely did this on purpose!</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After walking out of the room, Gu Qingyu nodded at Xie Zang.</p>
 <p>Xie Zang froze. "Why?"</p>
 <p>"What why?" Gu Qingyu smiled. "Open the door quickly, I don't want a sweet girl like her to suffer."</p>
 <p>Xie Zang nodded, and the wall cracked. A tunnel opened.</p>
 <p>"I should go alone," Gu Qingyu nodded to Xie Zang, "Trust me."</p>
 <p>He relented and moved aside.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu walked in, the Lifeblood Jewel of Destiny was in her clenched fist. The jewel let out tiny sparks of light, Yan Zun floated in the air as he followed Gu Qingyu into Xie Li's room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Li obviously didn't fall asleep. She got up and looked at Gu Qingyu with watery, doe eyes. "Miss..."</p>
 <p>"Don't be afraid," Gu Qingyu walked over and squatted down to her eye level, just like Xie Zang, and gently touched her head. "I'm here to treat you."</p>
 <p>"Treat my illness? Can it be cured?" Xie Li was ecstatic.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and turned to Yan Zun, who was beside her. Yan Zun did not speak, but Gu Qingyu saw a strange, profound look in his eyes. It was endless longing and endless hatred.</p>
 <p>"Don't be afraid, close your eyes first. It's just like going to sleep." Gu Qingyu touched Xie Li's head, and Xie Li nodded obediently. She laid down and pulled up the blanket.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu helped to tuck her in. After that, she got up and called softly in her mind. "Master?"</p>
 <p>Yan Zun responded with a smile, "After that, I will be asleep for ten days. Don't wake me up."</p>
 <p>"Ten days?" Gu Qingyu frowned. She knew that it would cost him a lot of energy, but the duration worried her. Still, she agreed. "Okay."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Yan Zun slowly walked to Xie Li, his robes billowed, and a bloody mist wrapped around him. Xie Li kept her eyes closed, her long eyelashes quivered. It was clear that she was anxious. Gu Qingyu gently held Xie Li's hand, and she gradually calmed down. The fog slowly melted into Xie Li's body. She frowned at the beginning, but as time went on, the tension between her brows disappeared. Gu Qingyu was relieved when she saw this and she slowly let go of Xie Li's hand. Finally, the blood mist dissipated, it had completely melted in Xie Li's body.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu breathed a sigh of relief, and turned to Yan Zun. His face had turned pale. Their eyes met and he said, "I'm going to sleep now, remember what I said. If there is any danger, swallow this." He held out his hand, a white sphere-shaped medicine rested on his palm. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took it and bowed to Yan Zun. "Thank you, Master!"</p>
 <p>Yan Zun floated and disappeared into Gu Qingyu's body, then she left the room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>When Gu Qingyu stepped out of the tunnel, the first thing she saw was the frantic Xie Zang and Jia Qizhe, who was resting his eyes. Xie Zang opened his mouth to say something. She interrupted him and said with a nod, "Everything's ok now."</p>
 <p>Xie Zang smiled. "Thank you, Kitten." He walked into the secret tunnel.&nbsp;</p>

 <p>Siblings, the love between them can be very beautiful. I never expected Xie Zang to have a sister, although in hindsight it made perfect sense. The poisonous Xieli flowers appeared back in Chapter 39, when Jia Qizhe and Gu Qingyu fought Xie Zang for the first Spirit Gem. I think since then, Gu Qingyu has become slightly on edge whenever she smells flowers. As usual, I hope you guys enjoyed this chapter! </p>
