 <p>At the end of the song, Gu Qingyu nodded profusely. "It's the first time I've heard anything like this."</p>
 <p>"So did Yu'er enjoy it?" Mo Bai smiled slightly, his face was extremely beautiful in the sun.</p>
 <p>"I enjoyed it! Of course I did!" Gu Qingyu nodded immediately. <em>A beautiful man playing the flute for you every day? Just the thought alone is pleasing!</em></p>
 <p>"That's good." Mo Bai put away the flute. "Yu'er, I still need to harvest some medicine, so I'll be heading out now."</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, come back soon." Gu Qingyu waved her handkerchief as she watched Mo Bai's back longingly. &nbsp;Mo Bai turned back slightly and waved. The warm sunlight lit up the soft smile on his face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu only felt that something thick trickled out of her nose. "Not good!" She immediately covered her nose with the handkerchief. "Why does this nosebleed show at the worst timings! I'm really too heaty these days!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>There was a chuckle in the shadows.</p>
 <p>"Xie Zang?" Gu Qingyu cleaned her nose quickly. "Why are you here?"</p>
 <p>"Why? Can't I be here?" Xie Zang stepped out of the shadows. "Kitten~" His smile seemed charming.</p>
 <p>"Yes, yes, yes!" Gu Qingyu rushed to try to stop the river that was pouring out of her nose.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Kitten," Xie Zang watched Gu Qingyu. "You've lost so much blood, are you alright?"</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Wait, can you not call me like that?" His was the weirdest amongst her many nicknames.</p>
 <p>"You have a point." Xie Zang nodded as he commented. "Somewhere along the way, my kitten became a ferocious tiger."</p>
 <p>"What do you mean?" Gu Qingyu managed to tell he had a different meaning in that statement.</p>
 <p>Xie Zang smiled. "What do you mean? Don't you know, Kitten?" He leaned in slightly, his hair tumbled like waves in a waterfall. "Kitty, you can evoke people's curiosity, and...Possessiveness."</p>
 <p>"You're crazy." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and walked away.</p>
 <p>Xie Zang trailed behind her. "By the way, just a piece of advice. Try not to use the Soul Chain too much, it's not a good thing after all..."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was shocked. <em>He knew that just by looking at it? He's truly the owner of Xieli Castle.</em></p>
 <p>She gave him a faint smile. "Thank you for your input."</p>
 <p>"Don't be so cold." Xie Zang still followed her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Oh yeah, Xie Zang." Gu Qingyu stopped suddenly, and Xie Zang almost bumped into her. "I want to check on Murong Zuoyu and Qi Yichen, I'm still worried about them."</p>
 <p>"Eh? So you want me to take you there?" Xie Zang curled the corner of his lips.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"If you don't want to, then forget it." Gu Qingyu resumed her pace.</p>
 <p>"Don't! Don't! Don't! I'll bring you there! Let's go!" Xie Zang immediately followed. "Kitten, wait for me!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The trip was shortened greatly with Xie Zang's help. Soon, they arrived at the Imperial City of Beiying.</p>
 <p>"Wow, so much delicious food!" Gu Qingyu looked around as she walked down the street. She reached in her pockets, and could not find anything.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>After all, I just wanted to take a look at it on a whim, I did not expect Xie Zang to actually bring me here.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"Xie Zang ..." Gu Qingyu had to look pitifully at Mr. Xie Zang</p>
 <p>Xie Zang looked at Gu Qingyu, his eyebrows were raised as if he had expected her reaction. "Why, kitten, you're hungry but you forgot to bring money?"</p>
 <p><em>That's true, but you don't have to be direct about it...&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"Yes." Gu Qingyu's voice was reduced to a whisper.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Want me to buy it?" Xie Zang's voice became softer.</p>
 <p>"Yes." Her voice grew even softer.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Zang laughed. "Okay, call me Zang."</p>
 <p>"Zang." Gu Qingyu repeated subconsciously, the word rolled weirdly against her tongue.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Well, good girl." Xie Zang seemed to be really happy that he laughed heartily. He pulled Gu Qingyu to a pile of delicious food. "Just pick whatever you want."</p>
 <p><em>You like this kind of stuff? Why is this the same routine as Yan Zun?</em></p>
 <p>Well, beggars can't be choosers, Gu Qingyu immediately grabbed the snacks at an insane speed. Xie Zang was stunned slightly, probably because he did not expect Gu Qingyu to behave in such a direct manner. But he gave his word, so he coughed gently, walked in front of the shopkeeper and threw a money bag on the table. "We'll take everything."</p>
 <p>The shopkeeper froze, he did not expect such a well-paying customer. He weighed the money bag with his hand and left. Gu Qingyu was completely focused as she grabbed handfuls of snacks. Finally, she turned to Xie Zang. "Let's go! Now for the main event!"</p>
 <p><em>So you remembered what we're here for?&nbsp;</em>Xie Zang's lips twitched. "Let's go."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They walked towards the palace grounds. Along the way, Gu Qingyu stopped to take in the view of the golden, majestic buildings. <em>It looks pretty badass!</em></p>
 <p>"Why, do you like this?" Xie Zang tilted his head as he watched her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook her head. "Can we get in?"</p>
 <p>Xie Zang gave her a look of disdain. "Who do you think the person standing in front of you is?" He wrapped his arm around Gu Qingyu's waist and jumped up to the palace. Gu Qingyu only felt the wind rushing past her ears, and then her feet found solid ground, right on top of the main hall.</p>
 <p>"Amazing..." Gu Qingyu gasped. "Are there no hidden guards here?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"All taken care of," Xie Zang smiled. "Just now."</p>
 <p><em>You're terrific, I give up.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu leaned down and gently uncovered the tiles. A handsome man in a dragon robe was just below them. She could not make out his face, but it's clear that he sat opposite of Murong Zuoyu, while Qi Yichen was standing at the side. <em>So, he is the Emperor of Beiying?</em> Gu Qingyu nodded secretly in her heart. <em>Pretty good, pretty handsome guy.</em></p>
 <p>The Emperor of Beiying shook his head. "This is our national treasure, I cannot give it to you."</p>
 <p><em>This emperor's voice is so familiar?</em></p>
 <p>"Why ..." Qi Yichen looked sorrowful and patted Murong Zuoyu's shoulder. "So, let's exchange it! You give us the Spirit Gem and I will leave Brother Murong to accompany you!"</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu turned down his idea as he pushed Qi Yichen's hand away. "Do not jest."</p>
 <p><em>What's going on with this casual bickering?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>The Emperor of Beiying was at a loss for words. Suddenly, he looked up slightly. "Who?" At the same time, light from his hand struck up.</p>
 <p>"Be careful!" Xie Zang jumped up immediately, and just when he wanted to catch Gu Qingyu, a rift opened at the foot of Gu Qingyu, and she fell down.</p>
 <p>"Hey! Handsome! The one below! Hurry up and catch me!" Gu Qingyu screamed at the handsome man in the yellow robe. The handsome guy was really obedient. He reached out his hand slightly, and steadily caught Gu Qingyu in his arms.</p>
 <p>"Baby got spooked!" Gu Qing exhaled. "Baby thought she was a goner!"</p>
 <p>"Baby?" The man heard it, but looked at her belly.</p>
 <p>"Ah hahaha, that's just how I address myself! " Gu Qingyu touched her head, then looked at the person, "Well, you are ..." She recalled and gasped. "Qian Cheng?! "</p>
 <p>"So delighted to see me?" Qian Cheng's voice filled with smiles. <em>I wondered why Qi Yichen dared to speak so... informally.</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded, remembering that she still had things to do. "Qian Cheng, are you actually the Emperor of Beiying?"</p>
 <p>"I apologise, Brother Zhu. I did not intend to conceal my identity." Qian Cheng blinked his good-looking eyes. "but, will you continue to sit in the arms of an Emperor?"</p>
 <p>"Ah, sorry!" Gu Qingyu jumped up immediately. "I didn't mean it!"</p>
 <p>"Not that I mind, even if it was intentional." Qian Cheng's eyes twinkled.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"By the way, Qian Cheng, I wanted… to ask you for a Spirit Gem." Gu Qingyu was embarrassed when she said this. She hadn't known Qian Cheng for a long time, they weren't really familiar, at least not to the point that she could make such a request. So she was not sure if he would agree. Because she didn't want to fight Qian Cheng. Somewhere along the way, she had seen him as a friend.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qian Cheng nodded. "I can. But, I have a condition."</p>
 <p><em>He agreed! Did I hear right?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded immediately. "What is it?"</p>
 <p>He stretched out three fingers, and his slender fingers waved in front of Gu Qingyu. "Three days."</p>
 <p>"What?" Gu Qingyu said for a moment.</p>
 <p>"Stay with me for three days." Qian Cheng raised the corners of his lips, revealing his devious plan.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu paused, then looked out the window. "No problem, there are two days left."</p>
 <p>Qian Cheng flinched, Gu Qingyu had countered him so effortlessly. But he knew better than to argue with her, so he dropped it. Qian Cheng waved at Murong Zuoyu and Qi Yichen. "Both of you can go."</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen's eyes almost popped out. "Brother Zhu, you ..."</p>
 <p>"I have made up my mind!" Gu Qingyu waved her hands.</p>
 <p>"No, I want to say, Brother Zhu, your snacks have fallen to the ground." Qi Yichen returned to peace.</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu looked down and immediately squatted down. "Remind me sooner!"</p>
 <p>Qian Cheng and Qi Yichen were both speechless as they all watched Gu Qingyu gather her snacks.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"In that case," Murong Zuoyu stood up. "Brother Zhu, we will take our leave." He looked expressionless.</p>
 <p>"Ok, just wait for me at the usual spot!" Gu Qingyu nodded solemnly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After they left, only Gu Qingyu and Qian Cheng remained in the hall.</p>
 <p>"By the way, Qian Cheng, what's your real name?" Gu Qingyu ate as she took a seat.</p>
 <p>"Bei Cheng." Qian Cheng raised his eyebrows slightly. "Cheng for sincerity."</p>
 <p>"Oh." Gu Qingyu nodded, and frankly, "My name is Gu Qingyu."</p>
 <p>"Gu Qingyu ?" Beicheng flashed in front of his eyes. "As in the famous Third Miss of the Gu Family in Dongxuan? The one that enjoys martial arts?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>So I'm famous... For real?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded awkwardly. "Well, rumour has it. Just rumours."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Brother Zhu! And here I was thinking how could there be such a weak dude!" Bei Cheng shook his head.</p>
 <p><em>Weak?&nbsp;</em>His language became more relaxed in private.</p>

 <p>And Qian Cheng is back! He’s the Emperor of Beiying! So far the countries are Dongxuan (East Strings/Melody) and Beiying (Northern Shadows). We started in Dong Xuan, where Murong Zuoyu is a prince and duke there. Now, we are in Beiying. A bit more screen time for Xie Zang as well, I personally quite enjoy his interactions with Gu Qingyu, although his behaviour really does seem similar to Yan Zun...</p>
