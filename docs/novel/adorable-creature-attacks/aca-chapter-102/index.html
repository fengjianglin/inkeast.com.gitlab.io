 <p>After Gu Qingyu bandaged the cut on Ye Jin’s hand, someone knocked on the door.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Come in." Ye Jin glanced at the door, and looked at Gu Qingyu again tenderly. Gu Qingyu was speechless.</p>
 <p>The door was pushed open, it was Crow, and he immediately knelt as soon as he entered the door: "King! It was a dereliction of duty! When your subordinate found Nightingale, she was dead."</p>
 <p>She frowned. "You mean, she felt bad for kidnapping a beautiful, kind and elegant person like me. It ate her up so much that she ended her own life?"</p>
 <p>Crow winced. "Queen, she was strangled."</p>
 <p>"That's dramatic. Have you found who did it?"</p>
 <p>"...Not yet." Crow obviously sounded frustrated and disappointed. "Your subordinate has failed."</p>
 <p>"Forget it, you can leave now." Ye Jin glanced at Crow.</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Crow immediately got up, went out, and closed the door.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin turned and looked at Gu Qingyu, "Xiao Yu'er, shall we leave tomorrow morning?"</p>
 <p>"Yeah!" She nodded.</p>
 <p>"Go rest now, it's getting late." Ye Jin looked out the window. "We still have to get up early tomorrow."</p>
 <p>"Okay. I'll head back to my room, rest well." She looked at Ye Jin reluctantly.</p>
 <p>Ye Jin gave her another teasing smile. "Why, Xiao Yu'er can't bear to leave me alone? You can stay here for the night, if you want to."</p>
 <p>"Meanie!" Gu Qingyu said blushing and retreated immediately.</p>
 <p>As soon as she left, Ye Jin's face changed. His brows furrowed as his breath became laboured.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Still haven't found the cure for the Frost Poison." He gritted his teeth and collapsed into his bed. "Damn it."</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the way to her room, Gu Qingyu noticed someone with a white robe heading in her direction.</p>
 <p>"Mo Bai?" She smiled slightly. "It's so late, why are you still up?"</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, are you okay?" Mo Bai was holding a lantern, his brows furrowed with concern. &nbsp;"I heard you were in danger, there's no way I can sleep." His cheeks flushed slightly.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu felt a little embarrassed after hearing this. "Thank you, sorry to worry you, I'm fine, go to bed!"</p>
 <p>"I’m still worried. I’ll walk you back.” Mo Bai smiled warmly, the warm glow softened his features.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"... Okay." Gu Qingyu nodded and walked forward without refusing.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai held the lamp and kept pace next to her. "Yu'er, are you hurt? Do you need me to help?"</p>
 <p>"I'm fine, but Ye Jin cut his hand instead." Gu Qingyu suddenly fell silent, her steps gradually slowed and she stopped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai stopped next to her and asked. "What's wrong, Yu'er?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nibbled on her lips, and after a long while, she finally asked, "Um... Mo Bai, do you have the Frost Lotus?”</p>
 <p>She noticed that something was off with Ye Jin before she left. Based on her calculations, it should be the Frost Poison.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai froze for a moment, then shook his head. "That can only be found on the Frozen Mountain. Ordinary people can't reach it at all. Why, Xiao Yu'er, what do you want that to do? Is anyone...poisoned?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately lowered her head. "No, I just read about in the library. I thought you might know something more than what was written."</p>
 <p>"Well." Seeing Gu Qingyu's room, Mo Bai smiled softly. "Then I'll be off, Yu'er. Good night."</p>
 <p>"Well, good night." Gu Qingyu opened the door, waved at Mo Bai, and entered her room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as she looked up, there was a red robe in the air. The man's eyes were enchanting. Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "It's scary, Master. I thought I saw a ghost."</p>
 <p>"Have you ever seen such a beautiful ghost?" Yan Zun floated to Gu Qingyu's bed and laid down. He propped up his head with one hand, and his silken, dark hair tumbled over his shoulders.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Eh... Now that I think about it, I don't think I've ever seen another ghost, other than you." Gu Qingyu rubbed her nose, walked over and sat at the edge of the bed. "Master, I'm going to sleep first."</p>
 <p>"OK, lie down." Yan Zun raised an eyebrow and made space for her.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu awkwardly slipped under the covers. "Master ..."</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" Yan Zun smiled. "My apprentice, your master has noticed that you have been a little... abnormal around your master lately."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu suddenly stiffened, and her brain spun quickly.</p>
 <p><em>Wait! If Yan Ruhuo is really Yan Zun, then he will know after hundreds of millions of years, he once talked to me! But looking at Yan Zun like this, he really doesn't seem to know? So, who is Yan Ruhuo?</em></p>
 <p>"Master, I..." Gu Qingyu suddenly found the courage to face Yan Zun's charming eyes. "I want to know your name." This was not just for the mystery surrounding Yan Ruhuo but because she genuinely wants to know Yan Zun's name.</p>
 <p>She thought Yan Zun would be angry, but he smiled instead. "That's what's bothering you? I am very happy that you asked about my name. Remember, your master's name is Yan Ruhuo."</p>
 <p>A pang hit her chest. <em>He's really Yan Ruhuo! So why doesn't he remember that we’ve met before?</em></p>
 <p>"Master..." Gu Qingyu suddenly felt tired, and she relaxed next to Yan Zun. "Do you know where my Spirit Gem came from?"</p>
 <p>"You mean the one you got after you became a white tiger?" Yan Zun's narrow eyes smiled. "Ah, many years ago, your master used its powers to seal away the White Tiger. That was how you came across it."</p>
 <p>"Then ..." Gu Qingyu thought for a while, but no words came to mind. She just nodded and closed her eyes gently. <em>There's always a solution to any problem. Who cares!</em></p>
 <p>Yan Zun did not disturb Gu Qingyu, he simply propped up his head with one hand and watched her quietly. The moonlight flooded the room.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>The next day, morning</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was awakened by an excited rapping on the door. She rolled over, still half-asleep. The rapping had given away the person’s identity. "Come in."</p>
 <p>The door was pushed open, and Qi Wan walked in brisk steps. When he saw Gu Qingyu still lying in bed, he immediately ran over. "Boss, get up!"</p>
 <p>"Wa no!" Gu Qingyu said as she rolled away from him.</p>
 <p>"Boss, it's time to go!" Qi Wan still didn't give up.</p>
 <p>"No!" Gu Qingyu covered her head with the blanket.</p>
 <p>"Boss, then I'm gonna go down and finish your portion of the delicious breakfast!"</p>
 <p>She immediately sat up, glaring at Qi Wan. "I dare you!"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan smirked. "Boss, finally got up? Your hair is a mess, you know."</p>
 <p>Her face was indifferent as she cracked her knuckles. "Ah? Say it again?"</p>
 <p>"Boss ..." Qi Wan swallowed weakly. "I didn't say anything. Nothing, you didn't hear anything."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu hmphed as she straightened her clothes.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Boss, would you like me to comb your hair?" Qi Wan watched her with a smile as she picked up a comb.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She rolled her eyes. "Do you even know how?"</p>
 <p>"Why won't I! Back in the day..." Qi Wan looked bold.</p>
 <p>"Back in the day, every morning you come to your daughter's room and gently wake her up and help her tie a pair of twin plaits before she goes to school?" Gu Qingyu raised her eyebrow.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan rolled his eyes too. "Boss, just what are you thinking about every day?"</p>
 <p>"Think about something you didn't expect!" Gu Qingyu handed out the comb. "Here."</p>
 <p>"Eh? You actually want me to tie your hair?" Qi Wan had an incredulous expression.</p>
 <p>"It's okay if you don’t want to.” She pouted and pulled her hand back, but Qi Wan took the comb in an instant.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took her seat in front of the mirror and watched Qi Wan’s reflection. He stood behind her, his dark green robe was warmed by the sunshine. His long fingers held the comb, and the comb moved slowly and delicately through her tresses, as if he was afraid of hurting her. In that moment her eyes stung, her vision blurred for a moment, and she reached up to rub her eyes.</p>
 <p>"What's wrong with the boss? Did I hurt you?" Qi Wan's hand stopped immediately, and he looked at Gu Qingyu in the mirror with concern.</p>
 <p>"No, no." She smiled, "Go ahead."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan continued to work with great interest: "Good! Boss, you can rest assured! Guaranteed to look better than twin tails!"</p>
 <p><em>Is that all?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu closed her eyes gently, allowing Qi Wan to style her hair in peace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>It didn't take long for Qi Wan's confident voice to ring across the room. "Okay! Boss can open her eyes! Quick, praise me!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu opened her eyes and looked at herself in the mirror. She thought Qi Wan would prank her with a weird hairstyle, but this time he combed his head seriously. Her hair was tied into a simple bun, it seemed ordinary, but it kept her hair out of her eyes. It was perfect for her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Not bad..." Gu Qingyu was stunned.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan looked smug. "Of course! I've always thought you would look good in this hairstyle, ever since I've first met you!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was speechless. "It sounds that you have been yearning for my hair."</p>
 <p>"No! I've been yearning for you, Boss!" Qi Wan looked at Gu Qingyu seriously.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Come on, let's go eat, I'm hungry."</p>
 <p>"Well, okay." Qi Wan smiled and opened the door for Gu Qingyu, a little lonely in his eyes. <em>Y</em><em>ou still don't believe me?</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu walked out, Qi Wan followed Gu Qingyu, and she saw Ye Jin walking towards them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Good morning, Xiao Zhezhe!" Gu Qingyu said with a smile.</p>
 <p>"Early, Xiao Yu'er." Ye Jin also smiled at evil spirits, and walked to Gu Qingyu's side. "Let's go have breakfast, I've already had someone pack the supplies for us."</p>
 <p>"Alright. Gu Qingyu nodded and walked side by side with Ye Jin.</p>
 <p>Right when they entered the dining hall, Mo Bai joined them from the other entrance.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yu'er." Mo Bai smiled softly as he greeted her. Gu Qingyu nodded. <em>Now, I wake up to handsome guys like this every morning! This is truly a reverse harem!</em></p>

 <p>Apologies once again. Chapter 102 itself took a lot of mental inertia to get through. I demand my boys be treated better! Side note: I thought Jia Qizhe promised to do Gu Qingyu’s hair for her, why is Qi Wan using the same trick now? Give my boy other skills and talents!</p>
