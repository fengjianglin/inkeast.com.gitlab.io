 <p>When she opened her eyes again, Gu Qingyu awoke to a noisy rapping at her door.</p>
 <p>“Who? So early in the morning…” Gu Qingyu rubbed her eyes and dragged herself out of bed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Boss, Boss!" Qiwan's excited voice came. "Can I come in?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu got dressed and answered with a yawn. "Yeah, sure. Why are you here? It’s so early..."</p>
 <p>"Hey." Qi Wan opened the door. "Boss, let's watch the sunrise together!"</p>
 <p>"Sunrise?" Gu Qingyu stroked her chin. "That actually sounds pretty good."</p>
 <p>"Let's go!" Qi Wan tilted his head and pointed at the door with his chin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay!" Gu Qingyu jumped from her bed and ran towards the deck with light steps.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>As soon as she went out, the biting cold sea breeze blew head-on. Gu Qingyu broke into a shiver, and before she could react, a warm sensation washed over her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"You don't even know that you need to wear more clothes." Qi Wan draped his robe over Gu Qingyu's shoulders. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Um, aren't you cold?" Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan. Then, bit by bit, a line of snot dribbled from Qi Wan’s nose.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I'm so cold, I'm so cold!" Qi Wan sniffled. "Let's go!"</p>
 <p>"Are you sure?" Gu Qingyu wrapped his robe tightly around her and eyed Qi Wan with suspicion. In a single look, she told him, “'You gave me this robe, don't you dare try to go back on your own words and take it back.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan reluctantly walked to the deck. "No problem, someone as strong as me ... Hachoo!" He sneezed before he could finish his sentence. Qi Wan slinked back to grab a coat.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>After half an hour.</strong></p>
 <p>A white orb slowly rose up from the distant horizon. Then, everywhere around them looked brighter and brighter. It was as if at that moment the wings of a holy angel slowly unfolded, like the blooming flowers of the rising sun. Gu Qingyu did not know how to describe the beautiful scenery in front of her, she just continued to watch and take in the beauty of life that surrounded her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It’s beautiful, isn't it?" Qi Wan gazed upon the horizon and golden light filled his pale green eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "It's beautiful! Thank you, Qi Wan."</p>
 <p>"No need to thank me." Qi Wan laid on the deck as he closed his eyes gently. "Actually, it would be quite nice if we just stayed here."</p>
 <p>"Yeah, yeah." Gu Qingyu responded and laid down. "It's really good."</p>
 <p>"By the way, boss," Qi Wan turned towards her with a jerk. "Aside from the sleeve arrow, you don't have any other decent weapons, do you?"</p>
 <p>"Well, that's true. But you don't have to be so straightforward about it." Gu Qingyu drew her lips into a thin line.</p>
 <p>"I own a weapon arsenal in Beiying." Qi Wan smiled. "Why don't we stop by there and take a look?"</p>
 <p>"Sure, might as well!" Gu Qingyu snapped back to her usual demeanor. "I can just take anything I want, right?"</p>
 <p>"No." Qi Wan blurted out. Before Gu Qingyu could scowl, he continued. "Weapons have their own will, and they can be picky. if it is willing to follow you, then you can take it away. If it doesn't want to follow you, then it won't follow you even if it destroys itself. "</p>
 <p>"Ah? There are things like that?" Gu Qingyu nodded. "Well! This setting is actually pretty good, it's challenging!"</p>
 <p>"Hm...." A dark green ribbon slipped out from Qi Wan's sleeve, he stroked the ribbon fondly. "Yeah, it took me a lot of work to convince this guy..."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at the ribbon. "They seem quite useful!"</p>
 <p>"Yeah," Qi Wan nodded. "That's why it's harder to persuade them."</p>
 <p>"What about my crossbow sleeve?" Gu Qingyu shifted her gaze to Qi Wan. "It should belong to Jia Qizhe, right?"</p>
 <p>"Yes. But technically, that crossbow sleeve is not a weapon, at most it's a piece of equipment."</p>
 <p>"That is to say, the equipment does not have its own will, but the weapons do?" Gu Qingyu summarised. Qi Wan confirmed her theory with a smile.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>After watching the sunrise, Gu Qingyu and Qi Wan went to the dining hall. Jia Qizhe had already taken his seat at the table, there was no one else in the hall. It looked like he was the first to arrive. He watched as the pair walked in and asked Gu Qingyu with a cold voice, "Where have you been?"</p>
 <p><em>Uh... Why does he sound like he caught me and my lover red-handed?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu swallowed. "We were on the deck..."</p>
 <p>"Oh?" Jia Qizhe pressed further. "So, what have you done?"</p>
 <p>"We..." Gu Qingyu swallowed nervously again.</p>
 <p>"We were checking when's breakfast!" Qi Wan's voice boomed behind her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>This is the first time I met someone who could tell such a ridiculous lie without a single tell...</em></p>
 <p>"Waiting for breakfast?" Jia Qizhe turned to Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"Uh ..." Gu Qingyu paled. <em>What can she say? Jia Yizhe would certainly not believe her if she sided with Qi Wan, and she might even be killed. But if she does not Qi Wan, he would be killed instead.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"No!" After long consideration, Gu Qingyu replied in complete self-preservation. Qi Wan immediately stared at her with wide eyes.</p>
 <p>"We were..." Gu Qingyu licked her lips and said weakly, "Waiting for you to eat."</p>
 <p><em>This lie is even more ridiculous.</em></p>
 <p>"Oh! Waiting for me!" Jia Qizhe nodded and patted the seat next to him. "Then, sit down."</p>
 <p><em>Um... This went in a completely different direction than I imagined.</em></p>
 <p>"Come on, Little Yu'er, let's eat!" Jia Qizhe pushed the bowl in front of him to Gu Qingyu. The bowl had already been filled to the brim.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Hero Jia..." Qi Wan also said weakly. "What about me?"</p>
 <p>"Just eat outside." Jia Qizhe replied mercilessly.</p>
 <p>"Hero Jia!" Qi Wan wailed and tragically walked out of the hall.</p>
 <p>"Well, poor thing." Gu Qingyu shook her head and dug in.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Xie Zang strolled into the dining hall while rubbing his eyes. "Good morning, kitten."</p>
 <p>"Morning." Gu Qingyu ate her meal.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai entered the hall as well, dressed head to toe in white. "Good Morning, Yu'er."</p>
 <p>"Morning." Gu Qingyu peered behind Mo Bai. "Morning to you as well, Qi Yichen. Hm... Where's Brother Murong?"</p>
 <p>"He's been vomiting again since last night." Qi Yichen shook his head with a sigh. "Oh, poor him!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu turned to Mo Bai who sat down beside her. "Do you have some medicine for that?"</p>
 <p>Mo Bai nodded and took out a small paper sachet from his sleeve.</p>
 <p>"Thanks, Mo Bai!" Gu Qingyu took the small paper sachet immediately. "Thank goodness you're around, otherwise Murong Zuoyu would be puking his guts out for the next five days."</p>
 <p><em>Puke his guts out. That's a graphic description.</em></p>
 <p>"You're welcome." Mo Bai gently picked up the chopsticks in front of him.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They soon finished breakfast, and Gu Qingyu came to Murong Zuoyu's room with the medicine. Murong Zuoyu was lying on his bed, his face drained of colour.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Brother Murong?" Gu Qingyu entered the room and closed the door gently. "Are you okay?"</p>
 <p>"I'll be fine." Murong Zuoyu waved her away. "Five days will soon pass."</p>
 <p>"No, there's still another five days when we come back." Gu Qingyu stated with a straight face. &nbsp;She took out the small paper sachet, then poured a cup of water. She opened the sachet and dissolved the medicine in the water. Finally, she brought the medicine to Murong Zuoyu. "Brother Murong, Mo Bai made this especially for you. You should feel better after taking this."</p>
 <p>"Cough, Cough!" Murong Zuoyu took the bowl. "Thank you. "</p>
 <p><em>It must surprise many to see that the cold, stone-faced prince be reduced to a seasick child. However, it is precisely because of this side of him that makes it all the more precious.&nbsp;</em><em>Even if they look perfect on the surface, every one of us is only human, with flaws and weaknesses.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu left Murong Zuoyu's room and went to visit Xiao Qi. As soon as Xiao Qi laid eyes on Gu Qingyu, tears poured down her cheeks. "Xiao Yu! You've left me all alone ever since you had this group of handsome guys!"</p>
 <p><em>Why does she sound like a forgotten housewife?</em></p>
 <p>"Okay, okay, I love you too~" Gu Qing gently hugged Xiao Qi. "You're my wife after all!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi instantly blushed, she turned away and stomped. "You meanie!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at Xiao Qi with horror. <em>What is that reaction?</em></p>
 <p>Xiao Qi then sighed and shook her head. "Xiao Yu, why did you attack Duke Ze?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Duke Ze?" Gu Qingyu paused, then she understood that Xiao Qi was referring to Murong Qize.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Why? What's wrong?" She wondered.</p>
 <p>"What's wrong? What do you mean what's wrong?" Xiao Qi seemed more confused than her. "Xiao Yu, don't you remember?"</p>
 <p>"Should I remember anything?" Gu Qingyu blinked as she replied.</p>
 <p>"You're betrothed to Duke Ze! He's your fiance!" Xiao Qi explained exasperatedly. In that second, Gu Qingyu froze.</p>
 <p>"So my fiance is a handsome and legendarily powerful being but I beat him up with a group of handsome martial arts experts?" Gu Qingyu swallowed stiffly. <em>Guess I'm pretty impressive after all.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"Yes." Xiao Qi replied in a tight, clipped voice. Up till that point, she did not understand how someone as powerful as Duke Ze could be defeated. But she did not know that Qi Wan, Mo Bai, along with the rest of the party, were all renowned experts amongst martial artists.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Oh! What a shame. He's quite good-looking." Gu Qing sighed and shook her head. Not a shred of remorse could be seen.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi blinked incomprehensibly. "Xiao Yu, he is your fiance! Don't talk about him like he's only an object."</p>
 <p>"Fiance? Is there any use for that kind of thing?" Gu Qing raised her eyebrows. "Look, we've got Jia Qizhe, Mo Bai, Qi Yichen, Qi Wan, Murong Zuoyu, Xie Zang and ... uh... With so many handsome guys, why do I even need a fiance? "</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi looked at Gu Qing with a look of surprise, but she couldn't help but admit that she has a point. With so many handsome guys around, there really isn’t a need for a fiance.</p>
 <p>"Well, Xiao Qi!" Gu Qingyu patted Xiaoqi's shoulder with a sad face. "Although I love you very much, I'm still straight. And I'm pretty sure you are too. Why don't you take your pick and let me see if I can help you with that?"</p>
 <p>"Um... well, I do have one." Xiao Qi's face turned pink as she answered with much struggle.</p>
 <p>"Well? Who?" That greatly piqued Gu Qingyu's interest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi chewed her lips. "I... um... well..."</p>
 <p>"Aiyo, it's just you and me here! There's no one else!" Gu Qingyu prompted her further.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi took a deep breath and then slowly confessed. "Qi Wan..."</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan? Not a bad choice!" Gu Qingyu bobbed her head. Although she didn't know why Qi Wan would be liked by Xiao Qi, she still supported her. "Go for it, sweetheart! Pursue your love!"</p>
 <p>Before she finished her sentence, a pillow smacked her in the face.&nbsp;</p>
