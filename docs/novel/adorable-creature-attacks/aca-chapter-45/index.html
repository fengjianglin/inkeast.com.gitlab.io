 <p>Gu Qingyu continued her meal with her eyes glued to the table, Jia Qizhe’s behaviour had rendered her speechless and she did not dare to participate in whatever that has gone on between Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On the other hand, Xiezang was in a teasing mood. “Come, Kitten, I have more here.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu almost spat her food out. Qi Wan rubbed his forearms while he groaned. “Ah! Goosebumps!”</p>
 <p>It was not easy to finish a meal amidst Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai’s war, Xiezang’s teasing and Qi Wan’s goosebumps. Gu Qingyu wiped her mouth and stood up. “Yeap, I’m full.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan looked at her in fear. “Brother Zhu, you actually ate them all…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>He really could not understand, how can someone be able to eat so much... and so gracefully?</em></p>
 <p>“I have a good appetite, what?” Gu Qingyu looked ready to get into a fight.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi shot a jealous look at Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>How does she eat so much and not get fat, she’s an enemy of all women!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu, unaware of their reactions, stretched her limbs and slowly walked upstairs. “I’ll go up first, you all have fun!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She winked at Qi Wan, who was taken aback but gave her a look that he understood. Everyone else was incredulous. <em>Have fun? To think she actually said that!</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu walked into her room, sat next to her table and looked at the dark sky.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>If it is fine, we should set sail tomorrow. For some reason, I have the feeling that we can’t delay this any longer.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu slowly breathed out, a pang of pain tore through her chest as she tried to expand her lungs. That Fen Yi has really hurt her deeply.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Suddenly, a few knocks could be heard on the door.</p>
 <p>“Come in.” Gu Qingyu knew who came in without looking. That rhythm was exclusive to Mo Bai, two soft raps, then a few seconds later, three soft raps.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai entered the room, medicine in hand. “Yu’er, it’s time to drink your medicine.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu took the bowl and drank it all with a gulp. Mo Bai’s medicine was not bitter, it could even be said that it was deliciously sweet and tangy. She wasn’t sure if the medicine was never bitter or Mo Bai had added some things in.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu licked her teeth, unsatisfied. “I really hope to stay sick a little longer!”</p>
 <p>“What, Yu’er likes drinking medicine?” Mo Bai laughed.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu shook her head, but then she nodded. “I only like drinking your medicine, it is delicious.”</p>
 <p>“If there is a chance, Yu’er should try my cooking.” Mo Bai’s eyes were filled with kindness.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at him in surprise. “Huh? Mo Bai knows how to cook?” She looked like she discovered a new continent.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai nodded. “Yes.”</p>
 <p>“Wow, I will try it when I get the chance!” Gu Qingyu winked at him. “Actually, can we go out to sea tomorrow?”</p>
 <p>“Tomorrow?” Mo Bai’s brows furrowed. “Anything urgent?”</p>
 <p>“Nothing, I just feel that my body has been dragging everyone down, it’s been so long... ” She suddenly had an idea. “Could it be…” &nbsp;Mo Bai tilted his head. “Could it be what?”</p>
 <p>“Could it be someone was deliberating slowing us down?” Gu Qingyu had a bold revelation. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Indeed, from the initial assassination to the attacks at the mountains and the village, then ‘Fen Yi’s’ strike on her, all these suggested someone wants me dead, and to perhaps stall us. Is it because someone wants the Spirit Gems too? But, how do they know that I want the Spirit Gems in the first place? What if...</em></p>
 <p>Mo Bai reached out and stroked Gu Qingyu’s head tenderly. “It’s okay, Yu’er, don’t think so much. Have a good rest, we can go out to sea after another day. I will not disturb you any longer, rest well.”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Gu Qingyu obediently nodded.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mere moments after Mo Bai left, Qi Wan opened the door and walked in.</p>
 <p>“It’s really late, boss…” Qi Wan yawned. “Say it, what do you need me for?”</p>
 <p>That was right, that wink she gave him after dinner was a signal.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yeah, Qi Wan, I want to go see Fen Yi, can I?” Gu Qingyu said hesitantly.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was taken aback but smiled. “Of course, as long as you want to, let’s go.”</p>
 <p><em>Of course, as long as you want to.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled too. She stood up and Qi Wan rushed to her side and supported her by the elbow.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It’s alright, I am not the elderly or the disabled, take care of yourself to not trip again.” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes at him.</p>
 <p>“Oh yeah, boss...” Qi Wan’s face suddenly darkened.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at him, perplexed. “What’s wrong? Why does that look that suggests I owe you billions?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Boss, if one day, you discover that the person you see today, is not the real me, then… would you still trust me?” Qi Wan took a deep breath and spoke in a tight voice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled and patted Qi Wan’s head. “Silly kid, I don’t care about your real appearance, I care about your heart.” She paused, but her smile remained. “As long as your feelings towards me don't change, then you are my Qi Wan, no matter who or what you are.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, boss.” Qi Wan smiled too and returned to his old self. “Alright, let’s move.”</p>
 <p>“Yeah.” Gu Qingyu pushed open the door. “Where’s she?”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Follow me.” Qi Wan led Gu Qingyu through the meandering and confusing hallways to a room.</p>
 <p>They gently opened the door to see Fen Yi lying on the floor, blood flowing out her chest. Both of them were stunned, Qi Wan instinctively reached over to cover Gu Qingyu’s eyes, but she squatted down near the corpse for a closer inspection.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey, boss, you…” He thought Gu Qingyu would be frightened, but who would have thought this woman had nerves of steel. That revelation scared Qi Wan more than the corpse before them. “Don’t push yourself…”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu dipped her finger in the blood, then sniffed it. “...Yeap, it’s fresh.”</p>
 <p>“Fresh?” Qi Wan’s eyes almost popped out. “You want to drink it?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu gazed at her red fingertips before she shook her head. “Yeah, even though it’s tempting. But I don’t like the taste.”</p>
 <p>“Then again… How do you know this is fresh? You had practice? You’re a private investigator? Or a spy? Don’t say! Let me guess…” Qi Wan seemed to ponder seriously.</p>
 <p>“Dumbass, I’m a cat demon.” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan realized and slapped his forehead. “Oh yeah! Why didn’t I think of that!”</p>
 <p>“Because you’re dumb.” Gu Qingyu shrugged and stood up. “Fresh blood, very recent death. And this is not a small wound, she was pierced through her chest, a dagger wouldn’t be enough to do this. Her eyes were peaceful, so it was someone she knew.”</p>
 <p>“Wow, impressive…” Qi Wan clapped his hand on his own accord. “Boss? Boss, what’s wrong…”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu’s face had turned a shade white. Before he could finish his question, Gu Qingyu bent down and started vomiting violently.</p>
 <p>“Boss…” Qi Wan immediately walked over to tap her back. “I told you not to push yourself...Come, let us go out first, someone will clean this up.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and left the room with Qi Wan’s support.</p>
 <p>“Let’s g-go to the rooftops.” Gu Qingyu held her breath. Qi Wan quickly took Gu Qingyu in his arms, he leaped out the window and landed on the roof.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu breathed a sigh of relief and took large breaths of fresh air, “For some reason...in that split second, I liked the gore. But nausea kicked in right after that. ”</p>
 <p>“Then don’t smell it in the future.” Qi Wan sat on the roof alongside Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“Qi Wan…” Gu Qingyu weakly licked her lips. “I want to...drink wine…”</p>
 <p>Mo Bai was amazing indeed, she had only taken her medicine a while ago and her chest had stopped aching. If it were Jia Qizhe, Mo Bai, Murong Zuoyu, Xiao Qi or even Qi Yichen, she would not make such an obstinate request. But it was Qi Wan, who was most tolerant and followed her along on her wild antics.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan did a double-take, then firmly shook his head, “No, boss, your wounds had not healed, something as strong as wine would… Alright, wait for me.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan could only give up in defeat at the sight of Gu Qingyu’s imploring, doe-eyed look. He got up begrudgingly. “Only a little.” &nbsp;After a while, Qi Wan returned with two jars of wine.</p>
 <p>“Do you look like you are only letting me drink a little?” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan sat down then hugged a jar, alarmed. “Who said these are for you? They’re all mine!” He then pulled out a small wine cup from his sleeve and filled it halfway. “Here, you can only drink this much.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu silently placed one hand on the other and cracked her knuckles.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan begged, “Ah, boss, you really cannot drink anymore!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t waste your breath, bring the wine over.” Gu Qingyu pouted. “I’m in a bad mood.”</p>
 <p>“You can’t hurt yourself even when you’re in a bad mood!” Qi Wan sobbed but he could not resist Gu Qingyu’s whining.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Go.” A calm voice, mixed with evident anger, said from behind Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>“Hmph, you ask me to go and I should go?” Something came over Qi Wan and he retorted with firm determination.</p>
 <p><em>It was Mo Bai?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was surprised and ashamed. She lowered her head and gently tugged Qi Wan’s sleeve. “Go.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan was stunned, then smiled and stood up. “Since Boss said so, then I’ll go to sleep, good night!” He disguised his loneliness and took his jars of wine, the clear liquid rippled in the wind and he walked away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yeah, good night.” After Qi Wan left, Gu Qingyu was about to leave, but Mo Bai sat down beside her.</p>
 <p>“Um…” Gu Qingyu raised her head and met Mo Bai’s slightly angry eyes. “Mo Bai, I can explain everything...”</p>
 <p>“No, I’m not listening.” Mo Bai snorted.</p>
