 <p></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: small;">[T/N: Transmigration of the soul - After death, the soul goes into the body of another being(empty).]</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chirp chirp—————”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huh? Why am I lying on the grass?” Gu Qingyu looked around baffled by her surroundings. ”Where am I?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wasn’t I just stabbed?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She looked around and found herself in an unknown forest. There were a great many trees growing in the vicinity and a river flowed nearby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stood up and approached the river. She leaned over and peeked at her reflection in the water. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Same ol’ me... But why do I feel a little strange? Hmm, did I get prettier? Also... Why am I dressed in clothes like those in historical dramas?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Qingyu!” She suddenly heard a loud voice behind her. “Yer surrounded n’ outnumbered. Ya bettah hand ova’ da scroll! We can spare yer life!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Uh-huh, that’s my name, but this escalation... Can someone explain to me what’s happening?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that I am in... another world!? </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But doesn’t this only happen in novels!?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wait, wait, wait. So I died for real? Is this a dream?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Oww!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Something sharp and pointy poked her in the arm. She peeked inside her sleeve...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh my god, there are at least a dozen needles in here! Did I just plunge into a super troublesome situation!!?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She looked back up at the masked men with genuine bafflement in her eyes. “Who are you guys?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>As if I would get so easily intimidated, I am a black belt in taekwondo!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Did ye get scared silly?” said one of the masked men as he brandished his sword in front of her. “Ye actually got the nerve to try an’ run from us. Aye, thank yer so much for makin’ it easy for us.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corners of Gu Qingyu’s mouth twitched, she didn’t know whether to cry or laugh. Only then did she realized she was actually holding onto a scroll, which she quickly unfolded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was the painting of a young man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man was a tall, elegant man with cold black eyes and beautiful long dark hair. He wore an ordinary long blue robe with long loose sleeves. Standing on a cliff, looking off into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why... What would you want this for?” she asked, stunned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The masked man started laughing, so loud it could be heard from far away. He finally said, “Gu Qingyu, ye must have really been scared silly! Hero Jia won’t come to yer rescue just ‘cause yer holdin’ his painting!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chia?” Gu Qingyu looked at him in confusion for a moment, then burst out laughing, “Bwahaha! Are you saying that I have to grow Chia Pets now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chia, my ass! Ye dare laugh! He is talking about Hero Jia, the name is spelt J-I-A!” said another masked man.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the point in arguing with her!” The leader drew his sword and sliced it through the air. Immediately the sword gave off a sharp current of energy, surging towards Gu Qingyu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu tried to dodge to the side when she saw the sword energy closing in, but her body refused to move, as if she was being pinned down by an unknown force...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Clank!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword energy was flicked away by a flying dart. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu sensed that she’d been released from the bind and subconsciously moved back.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Noticing a moment too late with the riverbank right behind her, she horribly lost her footing and slid down...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hyaaaa——!” A hand reached out, grabbing her by the arm, and pulled her up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu managed to stand firm again. She composed herself and focused her eyes on the newcomer in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh, a young man.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He stood there in front of her. His jaws clenched. His icy cold stare bore through the men, making them tremble. His long black hair flowed around his shoulder, giving the atmosphere an otherworldly air. He wore a plain long blue robe, yet he overflowed with control and authority.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Why does he look so familiar... Wait a minute, isn’t he the one in the painting?</span></i> <i><span style>Where did he pop out from?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>If I recall correctly, didn’t they call him something like ‘Hero Jia’? Yikes, so tacky! Who calls themself a hero nowadays?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hello, Hero Jia!” Gu Qingyu stood up straight and greeted him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man gave her a faint glance and didn’t speak.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the... Isn’t he here to save me? Why do I get the feeling he’s ignoring me?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s Hero Jia!” The masked men took alarm as soon as the young man appeared. “W-we only tried to... tried to...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave,” said the young man faintly. His voice was sweet like the sound of a skylark but mild like the cool autumn breeze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The group of men gave him a slight bow and fled immediately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu sneered at the fleeing crowd.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Tsk, tsk, tsk. Seems like Hero Jia’s deterrence power is pretty high!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>She cupped her fists like the ones she’d seen on TV dramas. “Many thanks for the help!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He gave her an odd sort of glance, then said, “Let us return to the residence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hah?” Gu Qingyu began to feel uneasy. “Us?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you okay? Did you hit your head when you fell?” Hero Jia looked at her very suspiciously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu, “...” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Does he think I turned into a fool just from a fall?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh... I forgot what I was going to say...” Gu Qingyu decided to play pretend and feigned oblivious. “Ahh! I suddenly can’t remember anything anymore... Oi, hey! Don’t just leave! Wait for me, Hero Jia!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Without waiting for her reply, Hero Jia had already drifted off ahead by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu could only hasten her pace to catch up to him...</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>The General’s Residence.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu stared wildly at all the people coming out of the manor to greet the two of them. One of them, a young girl, ran towards her. “Mistress! Welcome home!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Umm...” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Hero Jia responded in her stead, “The young lady had an accident earlier. I fear that it may have damaged her memory.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh no! Mistress, how could this happen to you!” The young girl pulled Gu Qingyu almost immediately to her side and checked her over thoroughly to see if she had any visible injuries.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yu’er.” A middle-aged woman walked out. Gu Qingyu believed that this middle-aged woman would be her ‘mother’ in this world. “You’ve returned. How did it go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m happy to say it was a fruitful one...” replied Gu Qingyu awkwardly. “But it’s just that I bumped my head into a large boulder, so I can’t seem to remember anything...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh dear, how many times have I told you! As a female, even if there’s nothing to do at home, don’t go out and attempt such dangerous missions! Why would you want to become some decoy or bait when you’re perfectly fine! You’re lucky you had Hero Jia to watch over you this time...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu listened to her mother rambling on and on, absorbing very attentively every single word, until she could more or less guess what had happened. </span></p>
 <p><span style>So it seems the young lady and Hero Jia were on a mission to retrieve a painting. But on the way back they were ambushed by the group of masked men. And while on the run, the young lady must’ve stumbled on something, then hit her head and died. Thus, for some unknown reasons, she’d managed to take over the body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Coming through like this... I’m utterly speechless.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>Entering the manor, Gu Qingyu couldn’t help but gasp in amazement at the sight of the interior.</span></p>
 <p><em>Woah, I was right... I'm really in another world!!!</em></p>
 <p><span style>The young girl led her to her room. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu studied the layout of the room——</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hmm, not bad. The room is to my liking. Hehe. Or perhaps say, the ancient Gu Qingyu and I share the same tastes?</span></i></p>
