 <p>After disinfecting Qi Wan's wounds, Gu Qingyu applied the medicinal paste that Mo Bai prepared. Then she picked up a set of clean bandages and began to wrap it over his wounds. She leaned close to Qi Wan, weaved the bandages through his arms and reached around his back to wrap a few layers of bandages around his torso. As she did that, Qi Wan rested his chin on her shoulder. "Boss, I'm so tired."</p>
 <p>"Yeah, I know." A wave of melancholy swept through her and she rubbed her eyes a little.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"But, to be treated like this by you, even death is worth it."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu suppressed the sudden urge to smother him with the quilt. "Alright, go to sleep." She secured the bandages with a bow, then supported his back and helped him lie down on the bed. "Slowly."</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Qi Wan laid down slowly with her help. "Boss, you're also injured, get some rest as well."</p>
 <p>"Yeah, I will." She stood up, tucked him in and gave him another smile before she left his room. "Goodnight."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stepped out of Qi Wan's room and closed the door behind her. Someone in a blue robe had been waiting for her. His face was as charming as always.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Zhezhe..." Ye Jin pulled her into his arms before she could protest.</p>
 <p>"Hey, your injuries have not healed yet..." She chided as she remained still in his arms.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, how can you make these decisions on your own." Ye Jin muttered as he tightened his arms. "How can you give your heart away, even if it's for me? Your heart can only belong to me."</p>
 <p>"Yes, it's yours." She reached out and gently wrapped her arms around him and he placed his chin on the top of her head. "I'm sorry, I should not have done that."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No!" Ye Jin raised his head, held her hand and led her to his room. "It's my fault, I failed to protect you. But we should continue this conversation somewhere else."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu quietly followed him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They walked into Ye Jin's room, and he closed the door behind them. But his hand was still wrapped tightly around hers.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It's okay." She clasped her other hand over his and rubbed it gently. "It's all over."</p>
 <p>"Um..." Ye Jin lowered his head and slowly let go of her hand. He took out something like an orb from his sleeve and placed it on her palm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This is...?" She held up the object and turned it over in her hands. "...a Spirit Gem?"</p>
 <p>"Yes." Ye Jin nodded, "The dark Spirit Gem."</p>
 <p>"How did you get this?" Gu Qingyu couldn't help but admire Ye Jin, "Did you find it from that masked man?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No." Ye Jin shook his head, "It's Ghost Howl."</p>
 <p>"Ghost Howl?" His answer reminded her of the curious form that Ghost Howl took in the earlier battle, and figured that it had been damaged and broken. "Speaking of which, I think the Soul Chain broke."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Broke?" Ye Jin was surprised. "The Soul Chain and Soul Nails are unique weapons, both of them are sentient, it should not be broken so easily."</p>
 <p>"Maybe." Gu Qingyu closed her eyes and held out her hand. Black fragments gradually emerged and spun around her. Those fragments were spinning faster and faster, and they quickly came to Gu Qingyu's hands and slowly pieced together. Soon, the Soul Chain was pieced together. Gu Qingyu opened her eyes and looked at the long chain in her hands with disbelief. "It...fixed itself?"</p>
 <p>"No." Ye Jin stroked her hair and said softly, "You fixed it."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Me? I can actually do that?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Does it matter? You've already fixed it." Ye Jin rubbed her head. "Okay, hurry up and come to bed. you are badly hurt and need to rest."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Okay." She nodded, and was about to leave the room when Ye Jin pulled her hand and stopped her. "What?"</p>
 <p>"Right here, don't go anywhere." Ye Jin smiled. "I'm going to go out to settle something, but I'll be back before you know it."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu's heart started to race. "You're...you're not planning to...to find Mo Bai and..."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"My Xiao Yu'er is smart." Ye Jin's smile widened and reached up to his eyes. "Okay, go to bed soon." He said and turned to leave the room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Right then, Gu Qingyu immediately hugged his arm tightly. "No, don't! Please, you can just talk this out! He has already changed over to a new leaf!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ye Jin turned back to look at her in the eyes, his eyes narrowed as he questioned her. "Xiao Yu'er, does this mean you forgive him?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yeah, well, people make mistakes right?" Gu Qingyu swallowed weakly and looked up at him. Her voice grew smaller and smaller under his watchful eyes, until she trailed off.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"But he almost killed you." He refuted flatly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>She was at a loss for words. But she was not afraid, because he was not doing it for himself. He was doing it for her. &nbsp;Gu Qingyu hesitated for a while, then continued, "But, that person has already received the punishment he deserves, right?"</p>
 <p>Ye Jin was silent for a while before finally showing a smile. "Ok, then let's go to bed." Gu Qingyu's eyes widened in muted surprise.</p>
 <p>"You have a point." Ye Jin led her to the bed only to stop at the edge. "Are you...afraid of me?" He turned his back to her, so she could not see his face. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu smiled with a soft laugh. "Why would I be afraid?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't you think I'm... terrifying?" Ye Jin's voice was monotonous. "I kill without batting an eye. My mood swings violently from joy to anger and everything in between." &nbsp;Ye Jin was also aware of his behaviour. &nbsp;He knows his personality well, so he knows that it is difficult for anyone to accept him except his subordinates. But even his subordinates only look up and admire him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"No, I'm not afraid of you. You only killed because of me, and your mood sours because of me. You're gentle and soft to me, and when I spend too much time you get all jealous and huffy. But doesn't that mean that you care about me?" She walked up and hugged him from behind. "Xiao Zhezhe, you're amazing. Don't beat yourself up over like this, don't worry or fret about how you look in my eyes. Because no matter what you do, you're already the best thing that has ever happened to me." She knew that Ye Jin would only show this side of him when he was anxious. He may sound monotonous, almost uncaring and indifferent, but it was a thin veil to conceal the anxiety that was eating him away. &nbsp;She could tell.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Hmm." Ye Jin turned around and returned her hug. "Xiao Yu'er, what would I do without you. Please, don't ever leave me again."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't worry, I won't leave." She patted his back. "Okay, hurry up. Let's go to bed."&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After she laid down next to Ye Jin, Gu Qingyu closed her eyes and went to the spirit world. Yan Zun lounged on the chaise couch and played with a stray lock of hair on his chest. "Oh, stupid apprentice, you're here?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu scowled. "Master, can you not call me stupid apprentice every time we meet?"</p>
 <p>"Why? Was I wrong?" Yan Zun raised his eyebrows. "Stupid apprentice, you finally found another Spirit Gem."</p>
 <p>"Yeah, that was unexpected." Gu Qingyu nodded, "Were you surprised? Actually, I think I'm getting pretty good at this."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Stupid." Yan Zun suddenly knocked her forehead with a knuckle. "Do you think I would not know that the dark Spirit Gem was lodged in the Ghost Howl?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu frowned as she rubbed where Yan Zun had knocked her. <em>Why does it feel like you are pretending, Master? And it does not even look convincing...</em></p>
 <p>"What are you thinking about?" Yan Zun knocked her head again. "There are still two Spirit Gems left."</p>
 <p>"Then where should we look for it?" Gu Qingyu recovered and asked immediately.</p>
 <p>Yan Zun narrowed his eyes slightly. "Once upon a time."</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu looked at Yan Zun with some doubts.</p>
 <p>"Stupid apprentice, someone will give you a lift." Yan Zun changed his posture, looking very comfortable, "Well, your teacher will need to rest too."</p>
 <p>"Give me a lift?" Gu Qingyu was completely befuddled. "Master, what do you mean?"</p>
 <p>"It's exactly what I just said." Yan Zun closed his eyes and didn't seem to intend to talk anymore.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu had to give up, she rolled her eyes and left the spirit world.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After exiting the fiery red spirit world, Gu Qingyu found herself in a different liminal space. Everything around her was white.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This is..." Gu Qingyu lowered her head and looked at her hand suspiciously, but nothing appeared.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A clear and nice voice came. "This is my world, Master."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked up in surprise. "Soul Chain?"</p>
 <p>"It's me." The girl smiled, "Long time no see, Master."</p>
 <p>"Well, it's been a long time." Gu Qingyu scratched her head. "Um...I want to ask, why did you break earlier?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"I had just woken up at that time, so I wasn't paying attention, so..." The girl's cheeks turned a little pink. "The smell of blood made me sleep for a while. Sorry, Master."</p>
 <p>"It's nothing." Gu Qingyu shook her head. "But, isn't the Soul Chain your own body?"</p>
 <p>"It's just where I reside. The girl tilted her head slightly. "Master, thank you for fixing it."</p>
 <p>"Ah? I really didn't do anything..." Gu Qingyu smiled awkwardly, she was a little uncomfortable with direct gratitude.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"By the way, Master, I'm here to remind you." The girl bowed slightly. "The Soul Nail has awakened, and his dark personality is not as simple as he looks. Master, be careful not to lose yourself and fall into despair."</p>
 <p>Although she couldn't understand what she was talking about, Gu Qingyu knew that she was doing it for her own good, so she nodded, "Okay, I'll take note. Thank you, um...I don't think I got your name the last time we met."</p>
 <p>The girl smiled, it was as bright as the sun. &nbsp;"I am Wish."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Wish and Abyss. One gives unlimited hope, and the other pushes into despair.&nbsp;</p>
