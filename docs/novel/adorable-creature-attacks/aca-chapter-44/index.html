 <p>It was not hard to guess that it was Qi Wan.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan sauntered to the pair. Yet, the moment he saw the murderous intent in Mo Bai’s eyes, Qi Wan darted behind Jia Qizhe. “Hero Jia! If something happens to me, then you must put yourself in the line and save me!”</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe’s lips twitched irritably.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai continued to stare at Qi Wan with a withering look. He finally closed his eyes and when he opened them again, he reverted back to his gentle demeanor. He smiled and walked away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>It is not wise to argue here.</em></p>
 <p>Suddenly, Mo Bai heard Jia Qizhe’s voice via telepathy. “Don’t think that I don’t know who you are. I only put up with you because you’re not much of a threat yet, Mo Bai.”</p>
 <p>He turned and saw Jia Qizhe giving him a cunning grin. Mo Bai narrowed his eyes, then lowered their gaze and he walked away.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan, on the other hand, was curious. “Brother Jia, what did you say to him?”</p>
 <p>He could sense the use of telepathy, but what did Jia Qizhe that elicited such an expression from Mo Bai? Qi Wan was puzzled.</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe walked away as well. “Don’t stick your nose where it doesn’t belong, you’re not someone so simple either.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan thought. <em>Does your family know you’re such a tsundere?&nbsp;</em>Then, he chewed on his lips as he stood guard at Gu Qingyu’s door. A smile crept up his face. <em>He’s not wrong, with a party like this, how can there be anyone simple?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Evening.</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu woke up with a yawn. Even though her wounds still hurt, she felt a lot better.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Someone outside heard Gu Qingyu’s movements and gently knocked. “Boss, are you awake?”</p>
 <p>“Qi Wan?” Gu Qingyu did a double-take, “Come in.”</p>
 <p>The door opened and Qi Wan walked in, in his hand were medicine and something that looked like white bandages.</p>
 <p>“Boss, it’s time to drink your medicine and change your dressing!” The caring handsome man smiled while he pulled a chair to Gu Qingyu’s bed and sat down. “Come, open your mouth, drink up! Aah!”</p>
 <p>“Aah? What? You have a sore throat?” Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes in annoyance as she sat up.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Boss, be careful…” Qi Wan placed the medicine on the table haphazardly before he reached over and supported Gu Qingyu’s back. “Ah, boss, take it easy…”</p>
 <p>“I know.” Gu Qingyu took the medicine off the table, then made a disgusted face at the dark liquid. “It looks very bitter.”</p>
 <p>“This is Doctor Mo’s medicine. As they all say, bitter medicine is good for you!” Qi Wan coddled Gu Qingyu to drink the medicine, like a mother.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at the medicine again, finally steeled her heart and drank the medicine in a single gulp.</p>
 <p>“Wow! You’re good!” Qi Wan immediately clapped.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu glared at him. “Wow, how patronizing.”</p>
 <p>“Absolutely not!” Qi Wan pointed three fingers to the sky and swore.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes again. “You think I’ve never taken care of kids before?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Huh? You already have kids, boss?” Qi Wan’s sparkled with curiosity. “Boy or girl? How old are they? What does the father do? Is he even alive? If not, I can take care of them!”</p>
 <p>“Get lost!” Gu Qingyu shook her head. “They’re my friend’s, I was just babysitting. Then again… Qi Wan, who was that woman? Did you know her?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>On that subject, Qi Wan’s face hardened. “Sigh! Friendships can be sunk at any moment! I never knew Fen Yi’s true background, she actually managed to mix in with the rest! She was one of my best assistants. Who could have thought! What a cold and harsh world!”</p>
 <p>“Enough, stop acting like some angry widow.” Gu Qingyu could not help but laugh at Qi Wan’s antics.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Fen Yi, literally pink dress? What a matching name to that woman!</em></p>
 <p>“Alright.” Qi Wan took Gu Qingyu’s hand. “Little Yu’er, be good, we’re changing your bandages now!”</p>
 <p><em>What in the world is ‘Little Yu’er’?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“How can you change from an angry widow to a doting father instantly?” Gu Qingyu mumbled as she watched Qi Wan work. The bandages on her arms gradually unraveled, her palm had healed quite a bit but the initial gore was still visible.</p>
 <p>“Oh dear, it hurts to even see it.” Qi Wan frowned, his fingers traced the edges of the wounds. It did not hurt but it was a little itchy. He took out something like an herb paste and evenly applied it over the gash. His eyes were serious as he tended to her wounds.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu suddenly lowered her head. “Thank you, Qi Wan.”</p>
 <p>He took a piece of clean white cloth and wrapped them around Gu Qingyu’s hand, then finished it with a beautiful butterfly knot. “Huh? What did you say? I didn’t hear you.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you!” Gu Qingyu raised her voice, but it agitated the wound on her chest and she went into another coughing fit.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“My bad, my bad…” Qi Wan gently tapped Gu Qingyu’s back. “Little Yu’er, actually you don’t need to say thanks. This is for mutual benefit, I follow you and I can go home.”</p>
 <p>“Really, you just want to go home?” Gu Qingyu steadied herself and looked at Qi Wan.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Wan smiled. “To be honest, I'm starting to like the atmosphere here.”</p>
 <p>“Like?” Gu Qingyu looked at him, puzzled. “You like the life of being punched by Mo Bai and hunted by Jia Qizhe?”</p>
 <p>“Cough cough!” Qi Wan suddenly choked. “Boss, sometimes I really admire how your brain is wired!”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, thank you, you’re back to normal?” Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Little Yu’er, that was too intimate.</em></p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded and as he set down Gu Qingyu’s hand. &nbsp;“Then, boss, do you wanna take a nap first?”</p>
 <p>“What nap? I just woke up! Your Queen wants to go to the toilet!” Gu Qingyu had a stern face.</p>
 <p>“Cough cough!” Qi Wan stood up with a complex expression. “Boss, you express us, the modern people’s, brazen attitude without hesitation! I will get Xiao Qi!”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. “Why yes, thank you, I’ll carry on with our legacy.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan took a wrong step and almost tripped.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Soon, Xiao Qi walked in with puffy eyes and a red face. “Xiao Yu...how do you feel?”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I’m alright.” Gu Qingyu looked at her strangely. “Were you crying?”</p>
 <p>“I was so worried about you…” Xiao Qi rubbed her teary eyes.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu pulled Xiao Qi towards her and stroked her head. “Don’t worry, silly girl, didn’t everything work out in the end?”</p>
 <p>“Okay.” Xiao Qi rubbed her eyes again, she chewed her lip as she looked at Gu Qingyu, a blush stained her cheeks. “Xiao Yu, I hear you need the toilet…”</p>
 <p>“Yeah, I have to trouble you for this period.” Gu Qingyu grinned at Xiao Qi. For a woman of ancient times to hear from another man that her lady needed the toilet, was not normally acceptable…</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi stopped her words, she arranged Gu Qingyu’s clothes and supported Gu Qingyu. “That’s right, Xiao Yu, I’ll change your bandages later.”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Didn’t Qi Wan change it already?” Gu Qingyu looked at her, confused.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi was shocked. “Really, Xiao Yu? You...Sigh, it’s not that I want to chastise you, but you’re a lady, what improper behaviour!”</p>
 <p>“Um... just the bandages on one hand…” Gu Qingyu seemed to have realized something and explained.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then the ones on your chest?” Xiao Qi looked at her, skeptical.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu held Xiao Qi’s hand. “Of course I was waiting for my dear Xiao Qi!”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Evening.</strong></p>
 <p>The sky was turning from orange to purple, Gu Qingyu rubbed her belly. “I’m hungry, let’s go down and eat!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi did not know why she suddenly felt being tasked with the honour of taking care of a brat…</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll ask for the food to be brought here?” Xiao Qi asked cautiously. Gu Qingyu shook her leg as she sat on her bed, her chest was hurting far less after they changed her dressing.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Mo Bai is an amazing doctor, yeah, I should learn from him when I have the time.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>She said, “I feel like I’m going to rot in this room! I need some fresh air!”</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi supported Gu Qingyu by the arm. “Slow down, Xiao Yu, we’ll walk slowly.”</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>When Gu Qingyu walked downstairs, a group of people directed their eyes to her.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai’s eyebrows furrowed and he was about to speak, but Jia Qizhe was a step ahead of him. “Why are you downstairs? Your wounds have healed?”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded and gave a wide grin. “Thanks to Mo Bai’s medicine! I am almost well!”</p>
 <p>“Brother Zhu, I have missed you!” Qi Yichen looked teary-eyed.</p>
 <p>Xie Zang ate his meal slowly. “Come, Kitten, come over and eat.”</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu walked over and sat in an empty seat between Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai. Xiao Qi sat down too and saw Qi Wan smiling at her, her face instantly blushed bright red.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Sigh, the woman these days.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu sighed, shook her head and picked up her chopsticks for dinner.</p>
 <p>As she glanced up, her bowl was being filled up by the person next to her, there was almost a small mountain in her bowl. Jia Qizhe was seemingly unaware, his chopsticks continued to move.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu ground her teeth. “Jia Qizhe, are you feeding a pig!”</p>
 <p>“You’re too thin, eat more.” Jia Qizhe sneered, “I actually do want to feed you to be a pig.”</p>
 <p>“Tch.” Gu Qingyu pursed her lips, annoyed. Mo Bai was slowly adding food to Go Qingyu's bowl too.</p>
 <p>“Um...Mo Bai, that’s really enough.” She could not be fierce to Mo Bai and it was bad to flare up at a male idol.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai gave her a sweet smile. “You have not healed completely, eat more.”</p>
 <p>“Sigh, oh well.” Gu Qingyu sighed at the sight of the tiny mountain in her bowl. She readjusted her chopsticks to start eating, but Jia Qizhe’s chopsticks kept moving in and out of her bowl.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu snapped as she slapped his chopsticks away, “Enough!”</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe then picked out the food Mo Bai gave her bit by bit before he ate his meal. Mo Bai watched Jia Qizhe with an icy look, but Jia Qizhe seemed to be unaware and enjoyed his meal.</p>
