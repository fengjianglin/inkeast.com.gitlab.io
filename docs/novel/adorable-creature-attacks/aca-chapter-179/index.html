<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The neon lights on the street flickered, and the vehicles on the street come and go. August in this big city was unnaturally hot. Gu Qingyu sat in a room with the air-conditioning on full blast, but that did nothing to quell her annoyance and irritation. She glanced outside the window, the sky was turning dark, and sighed slightly before returning her gaze to the handsome man in a white shirt that stood in front of her. "What the hell do you want?"</p>
 <p>"Me?" The handsome guy raised his eyebrows and smiled. There was a gentleness in his eyes. "Doctor Gu, I'm really sick."</p>
 <p>"I agree, but the neuroscience clinic is on the fourth floor." Gu Qingyu smiled reluctantly at him and pointed to the door with some kindness. "If you don't know the way, I'll take you there."</p>
 <p>The handsome guy in front of her has been pestering her for several weeks. He might be handsome, but this sort of weird behaviour still annoyed her to no end!</p>
 <p>"No, no, no..." The handsome guy immediately pushed back his choppy fringe and leaned into her with one arm pushing down onto the table. He flashed her a toothy, flirtatious grin. "Doctor Gu, I only want you."</p>
 <p>"Come on. Mr Yen, I'm off the clock." Gu Qingyu glanced at her watch, exhaled, stood up, and began to pack her bag. "If you have any questions, I'll see you tomorrow. I'll even make an appointment for you there. Relax, it will be a really professional doctor."</p>
 <p>"Hey, don't..." Yen Qiwan immediately blocked her path and she slammed head first into him.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Be careful!" He reached out and grabbed her, steadying her feet.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>In an instant, a familiar faint fragrance filled her nose. Gu Qingyu raised her head and looked at him. He was very good looking. His eyelashes are very long and beautiful and his eyes glowed and shimmered under the lamp's soft light. She froze as she stared into his eyes. She seemed to have seen this moment before, maybe something similar had happened in her past lives. Perhaps time had repeated itself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Why, stunned by my good looks?" Yen Qiwan smiled, and he gently brushed the back of his hand against her cheek. "Am I that good-looking?"</p>
 <p>"Have we... met before..." Gu Qingyu asked unconsciously.</p>
 <p>A flush crept up her cheeks as soon as those words left her tongue. <em>That was such a bad, cliched pick-up line!</em></p>
 <p>She thought that he would laugh at her, but he lowered his head, his eyes were full of seriousness. "We have." A faint sigh was weaved into his voice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu looked at him. She did not believe him. They had met before? That can't be. He does feel familiar to her, but she was certain that she has never ever seen him until he started pestering her a few weeks ago. Sure, there was an odd sense of deja vu. But she could tell that it was only deja vu. Her memories couldn't have possibly gone wrong.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, let's go, it's getting late..." Yen Qiwan touched Gu Qingyu's head and looked out the window.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er?" She was rendered speechless.</p>
 <p>"What, can't bear leaving me?" Yen Qiwan smiled at her, then picked up her bag from the table. "Okay, let's go, I'll treat you to dinner."</p>
 <p>"Huh?" Gu Qingyu watched Yen Qiwan walk towards the door and immediately followed. "Hey, wait for me..."</p>
 <p>Yen Qiwan opened the door and bowed like a gentleman, "Lady first."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu held out her hand. "Give me my bag, I'm going home."</p>
 <p>"I said I'm gonna treat you to dinner." Yen Qiwan glanced at her sideways and stepped out.</p>
 <p>"Hey...you..." Gu Qingyu quickly turned off the lights and jogged to catch up to him. They entered the elevator together.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>They stood in the elevator in silence. There were only the two of them riding downwards. Gu Qingyu leaned against the wall, a little tired.</p>
 <p>She watched as the number in the elevator decreased with a sinking feeling in her stomach and a racing heart. Something was going to happen.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Fifteen...fourteen...</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu held her breath, her heart pounding wildly in her chest.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Realizing that there is something wrong with her, Yen Qiwan leaned over, "Xiao Yu'er, what's wrong?"</p>
 <p>She turned and looked at him in a daze. "I..."</p>
 <p>She thought she heard the pitter-patter of rain.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The elevator stopped suddenly and got stuck on the thirteenth floor.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu yelled softly and immediately retreated to the corner.</p>
 <p>"It's okay." Yen Qiwan reached out and took Gu Qingyu into his arms, patted her on the back lightly, "Don't worry, everything will be fine."</p>
 <p>Just then, the elevator door opened.</p>
 <p>"Huh?" The person walked into the elevator with raised brows. "Doctor Gu?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately poked her head out of Yen Qiwan's arms, and was stunned when she recognised that person. "Director Ye..."</p>
 <p>It's Ye Jing.</p>
 <p>Ye Jing glanced at Yen Qi Wan, "And Doctor Gu's friend?"</p>
 <p>"Ah, yes." Gu Qingyu immediately jumped out his arms, the awkwardness hung in the air.</p>
 <p>"Yes, boyfriend." Yen Qiwan smiled at Ye Jing with obvious hostility in his tone.</p>
 <p>Ye Jing's eyes sank, and he turned to her, "Really, Doctor Gu?"</p>
 <p>"I..." Gu Qingyu moved her lips. She was about to respond when the elevator doors opened and Yen Qiwan dragged her out without a word.</p>
 <p>"Hey hey hey..." Out of the corner of her eyes, she glanced at the mirror in the elevator door. They had stopped on the third floor, he must have pressed it when she wasn't paying attention!&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Yen Qiwan kept walking with her in tow until he reached a relatively hidden corner. Gu Qingyu shook off her hand and finally lost her patience. "Just what on earth do you want from me?"</p>
 <p>"I said that in this life you can only be mine!" Yen Qiwan gritted his teeth and yelled, "I'm not letting you go again!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His sudden burst of emotion made her heart clench as an indescribable feeling rushed to her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Yen Qiwan immediately panicked when he saw her eyes begin to water and suddenly pulled her into his arms. "Sorry Xiao Yu'er, I'm sorry... I shouldn't have yelled..."</p>
 <p>"Fool, why are you apologising?" Gu Qingyu wiped her eyes with the heel of her hands.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er... be with me forever." Yen Qiwan hugged Gu Qingyu tightly. His head rested in the crook of her neck as his warm breath tickled her ears. "Boss..."</p>
 <p>The corners of his lips curled upwards in satisfaction when her ears turned bright red, and he continued. "I'm not going to let anyone take you away from me this time."</p>
 <p>His words sounded familiar against her ears, but she still drew up a blank. "I..."</p>
 <p>"Don't think about anything. Just marry me, okay?" Yen Qiwan stared at her, his eyes gleaming with a soft light. She could tell that he was sincere and genuine, almost pouring with adoration and love.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"… Okay."</p>
 <p>"Say my name."</p>
 <p>"Yen... Yen Qiwan..."</p>
 <p>"Skip the surname."</p>
 <p>"Qi Wan..."</p>
