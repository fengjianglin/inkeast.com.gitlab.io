 <p><span style>“...” The corners of her mouth curled up into a smirk, “By the way, Hero Jia. Did you feel the strange presence that has been following us throughout the journey?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm, about that...” He paused, then smiled gently and added, “I don’t think there has been anyone following us.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No? If he says so then...</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>It must mean... that I might’ve been overthinking it!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded, her smile restored like an unveiled sun.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>However, there could still be an inkling chance that even Jia Qizhe can’t perceive it, which only means that my senses are amazing!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe didn’t comment this time, but instead, he sank into deep thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Truthfully, he had felt someone trailing them ever since they left the bamboo forest. He did not know its identity, but he sensed a very powerful force of energy, equal to him, harbouring in the other presence...</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Who could it be? Xiaoyu Xiaoqi Xiaochen</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A further distance away from them, a red robe peeked through the darkness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe stopped and turned to Gu Qingyu as they arrived outside the palace walls. “Hey, slowpoke. Don’t slow us down.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know!” Gu Qingyu pouted. A pair of snow white ears slowly grew out on her head, and a fluffy white tail peeked out under her dress, swinging side to side. “It might not even be me who’s going to slow us down!” </span></p>
 <p><span style>They ran up on the wall together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Jia Qizhe became taciturn as he looked out over the palace. After a while, he looked back at her, “I’ll survey the inner palace and see how it is. You can investigate the outer palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? Understood.” She nodded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew she couldn’t match up to him in strength nor speed, so if she still insisted on coming with him inside, rather than helping, she would instead just bring him more trouble and drag him down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu watched Jia Qizhe jump down, slowly submerging into the shadows. A moment later, she lightly tapped on the wall with her foot and flew gently down into the tall bushes around the outer palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She waded through the bushes when suddenly a pink petal fell down before her. She looked up and saw a young man dressed in a red velvet robe sitting on a tree branch. He seemed to be sleeping.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wow... Isn’t he a brazen one. He’s actually taking a nap on a tree in the Imperial Palace...</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Go up to him and try to find some information about him,” she heard the voice of the Jewel of Desired Fate say to her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Um, I trust you’re not baiting me.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu thought to herself that he better not be a dangerous person as she quietly approached the tree. “Helloo~! May I ask who you are?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hehe,” the red robed man gave a low chuckle. The way he looked down at her from above reminded her suddenly so much of the other red-robed man who dwelled inside the Blood Jade. “You may call This Lordship, Xue Zang.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>This Lordship... of course. Even their pompous titles are the same... One is a Lord, another is a Venerable.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Xue Zang... Blood Tomb...” She repeated the name over to herself. “You have a very powerful sounding name! However, I must ask... Why are you sleeping here? Aren’t you afraid of the consequences?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why can’t I?” The red robed man jumped down from the tree branch. The corners of his mouth curled up into the most alluring and beautiful smile, “Is this your home?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, nono. Definitely not.” She shook her head. “This is the Imperial Palace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The red-robed man stepped forwards, coming closer to her. “Not your home? But I followed you here~” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you just say?” Gu Qingyu was stunned at first, her eyes were blinking, puzzled. Then it suddenly hit her, “I knew it! I told him I sensed someone following us! So it was you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He smiled and nodded, “It’s been quite the fun and interesting ride so far~” He took a step closer to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wh-what do you want?” Gu Qingyu took a step back. “Before you do anything bad, I’ll have you know that I have the one and only, the infamous and mighty, Hero Jia of the Martial World, Jia Qizhe, with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who?” The red robed man tilted his head to the side and frowned slightly. He looked like he was trying to dig through his mind’s memory.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Oh my gosh! He’s clearly never heard of Jia Qizhe before! I mean look at him!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>But how? Could it be that... Jia Qizhe isn’t as famous as I thought?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu didn’t know that the man in front of her was an extremely prideful and arrogant individual, someone who looked down on the rest of the world, and someone who never inquired about matters of the Martial World, the City Lord of Bloodglass City.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh... Um...” She pondered a moment, then asked, “Why... Are you following us then?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Because I thought...” His smile deepened. “That the Third Young Lady of Gu Family ought to be great fun?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haaa?” His words gave her a great shock. “How did you——” she paused and corrected herself, “Why are you so interested in her?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No particular reason. I just am~!” Xue Zang put his chin on his hand and looked up at her in wide-eyed innocence. “And as it turns out, I found myself in great enjoyment being in your company. Don’t you think so too, Miss Gu~?”</span></p>
