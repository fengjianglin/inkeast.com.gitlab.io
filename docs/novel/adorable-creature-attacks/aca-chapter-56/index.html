 <p>"Well," Gu Qingyu looked at the weapon display cabinets that surround her. "This is simply too much. You have enough weapons to cover the walls. Qi Wan, how many do you think I can take?"</p>
 <p>"How many?" Qi Wan did not know if he should laugh or cry. "Boss, using just one weapon costs tons of energy, best to just stick to one."</p>
 <p>"Oh, okay." Gu Qingyu nodded sadly.</p>
 <p><em>Yan Zun is so powerful, you can tell at a glance that he has countless weapons. That must be why he was willing to give me that red lotus? Just imagine, if I could become as strong as him, how great would that be?</em></p>
 <p>Suddenly, she paused. Her eyes focused on a particular spot. Qi Wan followed her gaze and stopped dead in his tracks. "Boss, are you... interested in this kind of stuff?"</p>
 <p>"That's right." Gu Qingyu nodded.</p>
 <p>"I didn't expect you to be such a Boss!" Qi Wan stared with wide eyes at the giant sword that was bigger than Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"What are you thinking..." Gu Qingyu held her forehead in defeat as she walked over. "I'm looking at this" She pointed at the thing next to the giant sword.</p>
 <p>"Ah, baby got spooked!" Qi Wan clutched his heart. "So this is what you were referring to..."</p>
 <p>Next to the giant sword were several nail-like objects. Unlike ordinary nails, they have purple patterns on them and are locked together by several chains.</p>
 <p>"These are actually two weapons, but they were born as one." Qi Wan introduced, "The Soul Nails and the Soul Chain, sounds cool right? But they have been here for a long time. There were so many people who wanted to take them away, but in the end, they are unsuccessful. Well, if you're interested Boss. No harm giving it a shot. "</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu walked up to the weapons, her finger lightly brushed against the glass of the Soul Nail and the Soul Chain's display cabinet. Suddenly, it was dark. The world has darkened. <em>Who turned off the lights?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu checked her surroundings, darkness extended beyond her vision. <em>But why is she still awake? There seems to be something guiding her forward. Master, are you there? This... I'm a little scared...</em></p>
 <p>Suddenly, a flame appeared, warm and bright. "Stupid apprentice." Yan Zun's diabolically-charming face was illuminated by the warm glow. "Did I not say that wherever you go, your master will be with you, eh?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded while staring at the ball of fire in his hand, the flame cast harsh shadows on his face, almost twisting his features to that of a demon. "Where are we?"</p>
 <p>"This place..." Yan Zun calmly explained. "It's set up by the weapon you chose. A test, or to guide. Go ahead."</p>
 <p>The heavy darkness seemed to part at the flame as they proceeded. &nbsp;Finally, a light at the end of the tunnel. The bright light opened up to a large white space. A lady stood in front of Gu Qingyu. She looked at Gu Qingyu, with sadness and surprise in her eyes. Her hair was spun gold, and her dress was bright gold as well, like sunshine. But her eyes were violet in color. A thin white veil covered the rest of her face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Hello." She said softly. "I'm the Soul Chain. Your weapon."</p>
 <p><em>My weapon?</em></p>
 <p>"Well... what about the Soul Nails?" Gu Qingyu wondered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"He hasn't awoken yet." She sighed. "This may not be a good thing."</p>
 <p>"Sorry, I don't understand." Gu Qingyu shook her head frankly.</p>
 <p>"You will understand it later." That lady lightly rested her forehead against Gu Qingyu's forehead. "Now, accept us." Gu Qingyu stretched out her hand, the lady turned into a light and melted into her palm.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu slowly opened her eyes. The first thing she saw was Qi Wan's worried face.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Boss, are you awake?" As soon as he saw Gu Qingyu woke up, a smile spread across Qi Wan's face. "How do you feel?"</p>
 <p>"Well." Gu Qingyu pushed herself up. "I'm ok. At least I managed to tame the weapons."</p>
 <p>"I knew Boss could do it!" Qi Wan laughed. "Then let's go back!"</p>
 <p>"Go back?" Gu Qingyu looked around, she was in a small room. "What is this place?"</p>
 <p>"We're in a small room in the arsenal." Qi Wan helped Gu Qingyu get out of bed. "I brought you here because taming weapons would also consume a lot of energy."</p>
 <p>"How long have I been out?" Gu Qingyu battered her eyes. To be honest, Jia Qizhe's absence had surprised her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Approximately two hours." Qi Wan picked up Gu Qingyu and cradled her in his arms. "I've already sent a message back. You've overexerted yourself already, I'll carry you back! "</p>
 <p>His smile was so bright and sincere.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay, thank you." Gu Qingyu relented and closed her eyes, she was completely drained.</p>
 <p>"You're so light, Boss..." Qi Wan flew through the air. "You should eat more."</p>
 <p>"Am I not eating enough?" Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan in wonder.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan thought for a moment. "Yeah, you're eating enough."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Soon, they returned to the inn. Xiao Qi jogged over to greet them, her expression froze the moment she saw that Qi Wan was holding Gu Qingyu in his arms.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"She used up a lot of energy to tame the weapons, and she had just fallen asleep. I'll take her to rest first." Qi Wan just wanted to go upstairs but was stopped by Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>"I'll do it." She took Gu Qingyu silently from him. "Thank you, for sending Xiao Yu back."</p>
 <p>"It was the right thing to do." Qi Wan yawned and retreated to his own room.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi lowered her eyes to the ground. After a while, she walked upstairs with Gu Qingyu in her arms. Gu Qingyu woke up when Xiao Qi opened the door to her room, she looked up at Xiao Qi with bleary eyes. "Eh? Xiao Qi?"</p>
 <p>"Yes, it's me." Xiao Qi placed Gu Qingyu on the bed. "Xiao Yu, are you all right?"</p>
 <p>"I'm ok, sorry that I made you worry again." Gu Qingyu smiled.</p>
 <p>"Well, that's good... I'm going to bed then." Xiao Qi got up, but her hand was grabbed by Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"What's wrong?" She turned slightly.</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi, is there something on your mind? You looked like something's troubling you." Gu Qingyu stared into Xiao Qi’s eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi shook her head. "It's okay, sleep well." She gently turned her wrist and freed her hand, then walked out the door. So, Gu Qingyu closed her eyes.</p>
 <p><em>Speaking of which, I have find time to try my new weapons...</em></p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>In the spirit world, Yan Zun rubbed his head impatiently, it looked like he had been waiting for a long time. "Slowpoke apprentice, took you long enough. You've kept your master waiting for so long. "</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu drew her lips. <em>Stupid apprentice, slowpoke apprentice, do you have anything else?</em></p>
 <p>"Why are you not talking? Come on, dumb apprentice." Yan Zun waved his hand impatiently. Gu Qingyu resisted her urge to snap back and walked over to Yan Zun.</p>
 <p>"Now, try to summon your new weapon." Yan Zun watched her with arms crossed in front of his chest. "The weapon is useless if you can't even summon it."</p>
 <p>"How do I do that?" Gu Qingyu was lost.</p>
 <p><em>When Jia Qizhe summons his weapon, it seems that whenever he stretches out his hand, blue light would converge and form his sword. Qi Yichen carries his fan and uses it to defend at any time or he’ll transform it into an iron fan. Mo Bai usually uses his herbs directly, even though there is a flute tied to his waist. Murong Zuoyu keeps his sword with him at all times. I don't think I've seen Xie Zang use a weapon yet. As for Qi Wan, the ribbons seem to fly out from him directly.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>"What should we do?" Yan Zun stared at her as he pondered. "For a beginner like you."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu glared at him. "Excuse me? Are you saying you don’t know how to summon a weapon?"</p>
 <p>"No, my method would be too difficult for you, that's all." When he said this, his eyes were full of sincerity.</p>
 <p>"Thank you very much for your kind understanding..." Gu Qingyu shook her head.</p>
 <p>"Some weapons can be temporarily turned into air or gas around the host as they wait to be summoned. Some are directly held by the host; others usually live in ordinary objects." Yan Zun continued his train of thought.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Come." Suddenly he had a brain wave. "Hold your hand out and imagine them appearing in your hands. This shouldn't be too difficult right?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu followed his instructions, she held out her hand and closed her eyes. She could feel something weigh against her palm, it felt cool against her skin.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Not bad." Yan Zun turned to Gu Qingyu with a glint of approval in his eyes.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu opened her eyes with a flutter and in her hands was a chain, and locked on the links of the chain were nails. The Soul Nails and the Soul Chain.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"It seems that you have tamed something interesting," Yan Zun smiled slightly. "But only one has awakened."</p>
 <p><em>Awakened...</em></p>
 <p>"Yeah, I think only the Soul Chain has awakened. Master, do you know more about them?" Gu Qingyu looked at Yan Zun.</p>
 <p>He nodded. "A little. The Soul Nails and Soul Chain were originally two weapons, but because of some kind of bond, they are now a single weapon. The Soul Chain can be used for attack and defense, while the Soul Nails..." He paused. "The Soul Nails are a taboo weapon. Like the name, it can nail one's soul in place. Once the Soul Chain's powers are fully activated, it would also work as its name. With these two working in tandem, their owner would be able to chain souls and nail souls."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Even souls can be controlled? So overpowered? Wouldn't that mean that I'll be invincible soon?" Gu Qingyu grew ecstatic at that revelation. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Don't count your eggs before they've hatched." Yan Zun's lazy voice continued. "Activating weapons consumes your energy. If you fully activate the Soul Nails and the Soul Chain together, then..."</p>
 <p>"Got it." Gu Qingyu nodded. "Don't use it unless you have to. But I can still use the Soul Chain right?"</p>
 <p>Yan Zun affirmed her idea with a nod. "From the looks of it, it would just be an ordinary chain without the Soul Nails. I'll remove the Soul Nails for you."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu passed the chain to Yan Zun. "Thank you, Master." She watched as the nails fell easily from the chain under Yan Zun's touch.</p>
 <p>"Take it." Yan Zun placed the nails in a bag and handed it to Gu Qingyu.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu kept the Soul Nails and took the chain back. "So, what I did just now, I can just do that to summon the chains in the future?"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yes." Yan Zun said.&nbsp;</p>
