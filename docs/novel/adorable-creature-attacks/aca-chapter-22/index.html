 <p><strong>Chapter 22: Murong Ranyue (2)</strong></p>
 <p><strong>Copyright&nbsp;© 2018 Volare novels. Translator: PetiePotter, Editor: Arka.</strong></p>
 <p><b>Next day, afternoon.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu slowly woke up. She opened her eyes and saw Jia Qizhe standing next to her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You——” Gu Qingyu extended her hand to him. “How did you...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fool.” Jia Qizhe grabbed her hand and helped her sit up. “How did I what?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Nnngh—” She got up and looked around. “Where am I?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she looked around, she saw that the others were here too.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Including Murong Ranyue!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your colour is looking much better now.” Mo Bai chuckled. “We’re at the inn, Mi——Uh, Brother Zhu. How are you feeling?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She rubbed her head and looked at everyone's' faces. “I can manage.” </span><span style>She suddenly recalled something, “Where’s the plant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ranyue took a step forward, “I am not handing it over.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you not be so stubborn?” She bounced on the bed in frustration. “Then why did you come here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I came to apologize," he replied with naive innocence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Gu Qingyu was speechless.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could he really be that naive?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You came to apologize? Can you even protect yourself? What if we were to take it from you by force?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I am positive of leaving here unscratched,” said Murong Ranyue calmly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And arrogant.” Gu Qingyu looked at Jia Qizhe, “Jia Qizhe? What’s the matter?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe’s expression looked awkward. “He doesn’t have what we’re looking for.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How come?” Gu Qingyu suddenly realized that the reason Murong Ranyue was so sure of leaving here unscratched was that he didn’t even have it on him.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since Jia Qizhe said so personally, it ought to be the truth... Why am I still so trustful of his words?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“The medicinal herb was apparently taken by his imperial brother.” Jia Qizhe let out a faint sigh. “His brother is a Grand Prince, the highest title below the emperor and the crown prince. He has been a favourite since birth and is rumoured to be one of the candidates to succeed to the throne. His name is Murong Zuoyu, the Third Imperial Prince."</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Which number is Murong Ranyue then?” Gu Qingyu looked curiously at Murong Ranyue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fourth,” replied Murong Ranyue dully. His face was paler than ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“.. Why would your brother want this kind of herb?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>He thought for a moment, then said,” Because he knew that you would come for it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haaa?” Gu Qingyu blinked her eyes. “He’s that amazing? I mean... does that mean he can mind read? Or say divination? Oh, maybe clairvoyance?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Murong Ranyue shook his head dully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No? Then what?” Her eyes sparkled with anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magic,” he replied dully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What the... forget that I even asked... I hoped for another answer, it’s not like I enjoy talking with you anyways!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s the point of living.” Gu Qingyu jumped off the bed, “Let’s go”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where to?” asked Qi Yichen in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kukukuku~!” Gu Qingyu laughed sinisterly. “We’re going to go visit his brother~~~!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiao Yu is acting strange!” Xiao Qi was almost scared out of her wits by Gu Qingyu's creepy laughter.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No! Give back my sweet and silly Xiao Yu!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I have nothing more to say.” Murong Ranyue bowed slightly, “I shall take my leave.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Take care, I won’t see you off!” She imitated the martial artists from historical dramas and cupped her hands, “We’ll meet again in the future if fate so calls!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, I wish we’re destined to never meet again,” said Murong Ranyue flatly and walked out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>...!!</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What’s that supposed to mean! Did he really have to say it like that?! Am I really that scary?!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, who cares!” she sneered. “Should we wait until it’s dark?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes.” Mo Bai nodded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, right. Jia Qizhe, how did you get out safely yesterday?” Gu Qingyu could no longer keep back her questions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe slightly tilted his head to the side and looked at her, “You tell me. By the time I destroyed the defensive formation and got to the room, you were already lying on the ground unconscious. I had no choice but to knock him out too, so I could carry the both of you out of the Imperial Palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe said the words calmly in a casual voice as if he was talking about the weather. As if it had nothing to do with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Well, it didn’t have anything to do with him. But, it was greatly related to her!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you’re saying that... you </span><b>knocked</b><span style> Murong Ranyue unconscious, and then you </span><b>carried</b><span style> the both of us back?” She put emphasis on the two words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Correct.” Jia Qizhe crossed his arms and looked at her as if he was going to scold a child, “How did you manage to lose? He was so weak! You’re unbelievable.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu’s face flushed with anger, “You——”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, let’s stop right there.” Mo Bai stood between them. “Let us discuss our plan for tonight.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Basically, the plan was all set and nothing much changed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unit 1, Gu Qingyu and Jia Qizhe were to look for Murong Zuoyu. Unit 2, Mo Bai and Qi Yichen were to clear any hindrances for Unit 1, and lastly, Xiao Qi was to provide emergency support if needed. However, this time around, they had a slightly higher chance of success...</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><b>Nightfall.</b></p>
 <p><span style>Mo Bai and Qi Yichen were dressed in white to draw the enemies’ attention to themselves. The rest were dressed freely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pfft——!!” Gu Qingyu spat out the tea she’d been about to swallowed in shock when she saw Mo Bai walking down the stairs.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...” Mo Bai noticed that Gu Qingyu was sizing him up, “Is there anything wrong, Miss Gu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No...” She shook her head, but her eyes flashed, “Okay! Let’s move out! We must catch the one called Murong Zuoyu tonight! Wakakakakaka!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She’s acting strange again!” Xiao Qi curled up in a corner, shivering and shaking. In her mind, Gu Qingyu had already turned into a fiend from the underworld with a pair of horns growing upon her head, and a pair of wicked black wings protruding from her back, not to mention the red trident she was holding and the burning hellish background...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Set off.” At Jia Qizhe’s command, everyone stood up and put on their masks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Huaaaa———”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The only thing that could hear was the roaring sound of the wind. If it weren’t for Gu Qingyu’s innate sensitivity, she wouldn’t even have been aware of the people around her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>We must succeed this time, failure is not an option!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>——————————</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they arrived at the palace, they split up into different directions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe took the lead as Gu Qingyu followed him closely behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She did her best to keep up with him, but she sensed that he was holding back. She had to admit that he was fast, and even with this speed, it should be considered as quite slow for him, right?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Before long, the two of them arrived in front of a fancy door. Soldiers were scarce.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Could it be that Mo Bai and Qi Yichen already lured them away? Or, is this another trap?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu glanced around, more wary of her surroundings than usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful. You ready?” Jia Qizhe pulled forth a dagger and kept it firmly in his own hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Qingyu nodded and did the same, “Mmm, you too.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jia Qizhe abruptly kicked open the door. Gu Qingyu rushed to the open area at the entrance and held her hands in front, “『Lost Magic: Ring of Frost』”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately a great energy resonated from her body, releasing a ring of icy-blue light from her body. The ring of light grew and expanded, spreading through the whole room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Where the light passed, everything froze and turned to ice.</span></p>
