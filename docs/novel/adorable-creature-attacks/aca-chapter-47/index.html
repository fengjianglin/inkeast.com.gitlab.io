<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p><em>Dude, do you know when you smile like that, you’re usually thinking of how to kill someone?</em></p>
 <p>“It’s fine, let me do it…”</p>
 <p>“You have done enough as it is, you need to rest, Little Yu’er.” Jia Qizhe’s tone became much more gentle and tender than usual.</p>
 <p>This took Gu Qingyu by surprise, her eyes widened as she questioned, “Why are you acting weird too?”</p>
 <p>“Too? Is there anyone else?” Jia Qizhe raised his eyebrows, his tone was soft, but a faint blue light glowed from his palms.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“No, no, how could there be anyone!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Mister Jia, as long as you’re happy!</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe was silent for a while, then held Gu Qingyu’s hand. “Fine, you can come too.”</p>
 <p><em>Huh?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu blanked in her confusion, Jia Qizhe pulled her along and they went to Qi Wan’s room. Qi Wan got up the moment they opened the door. “Boss… Huh, why are you here?”</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe wriggled his brows, a wide, unnerving grin was plastered on his face. He walked over, &nbsp;sat down beside Qi Wan, and held a spoonful of ‘porridge’ against Qi Wan’s mouth. “This is personally cooked by Little Yu’er, eat it while it’s hot.”</p>
 <p>“You, you…” Qi Wan shuffled away while clutching his blanket. “What are you planning?”</p>
 <p>“Please, don’t be so dramatic.” Gu Qingyu shook her head with a sigh. She crossed her arms and leaned against the door. “I did make this. Don’t worry, it won’t kill you.”</p>
 <p>After her clarification, Qi Wan doubtfully took the spoon and popped it in his mouth. He immediately widened his eyes and looked at Jia Qizhe in disbelief.</p>
 <p>“How was it?” Jia Qizhe smiled with a murderous glint in his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Um...It’s good!” Qi Wan painfully swallowed the ‘porridge’. “It’s really good! Boss, are you sure you made this? ”</p>
 <p>“Yes, I did!” Gu Qingyu was unaware of Qi Wan’s pained expression. “How was it? It’s really good, right?”</p>
 <p>&nbsp;“Yes!” Qi Wan nodded frantically, his eyes watered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Then eat more.” Jia Qizhe shoved the bowl to Qi Wan. “Little Yu’er is watching.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan thought as he took the bowl. <em>Why does Hero Jia have a side like this? Indeed, having a love rival can change a person completely… Wait, what love rival!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>He took a few more bites and exclaimed each time. &nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ah! How delicious!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Truly magnificent!”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>But who could tell me why this bowl of porridge tastes especially salty? With a tinge of burnt flavour and bitterness? And there’s a sweetness among the bitterness?</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded in satisfaction and looked towards Jia Qizhe. “Ah! A novice cook like me is actually so talented! It must be so embarrassing for those masterful chefs! Looks like I’ll have to cook lunch later too!”</p>
 <p>“Um…” Jia Qizhe cleared his throat. “Little Yu’er, you’re really talented, it would be a waste to cook a common meal. I think we should save it for a better occasion.”</p>
 <p>Qi Wan’s eyes almost popped out. <em>To think Jia Yingxiong’s love for his boss has reached such heights? I can never say such words against my heart…</em></p>
 <p>“Boss, from this bowl, we can see your masterful cooking already! You are the number one chef in the world! This porridge is irresistible! I must have more if there is a chance!” Then, Qi Wan sold his soul to the devil.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Ah ha ha ha, is that so?” Gu Qingyu covered her face bashfully. “Hey, you two are embarrassing me with your excellent tastes!”</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe and Qi Wan looked at Gu Qingyu blankly.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After breakfast, Gu Qingyu sought clearance from their resident doctor. “Mo Bai, can we go?”</p>
 <p>A faint smile graced his lips. “How do you feel?”</p>
 <p>“I feel great! It’s a speedy recovery!” Gu Qingyu replied in an instant.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai nodded. “Very well, then we can leave in the afternoon. But first, we must find a sturdy ship…”</p>
 <p>“Huh? Are you asking about a ship?” Qi Wan leaned over. “I’ve already had it built over the past few days!”</p>
 <p>“Then everything is ready!” Gu Qingyu clapped gleefully.</p>
 <p>“Brother Zhu!” Qi Yichen walked over while waving his fan. “Did you miss your Brother Qi!”</p>
 <p>“No.” Gu Qingyu said flatly. “We’ll leave this afternoon.”</p>
 <p>“Afternoon?” Murong Zuoyu looked up, his face had turned slightly pale.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“What’s wrong?” Gu Qingyu tilted her head and asked, “Brother Murong, you seem off. Are you ok?”</p>
 <p>“No, it’s nothing…” Murong Zuoyu returned to his room and closed the door.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>“What’s wrong with Brother Murong?” Gu Qingyu was still lost in thought when Xie Zang walked over with a smile.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey, Kitten, how’s your recovery?”</p>
 <p>“It went really well.” Gu Qingyu returned his smile. “Actually, Mister Xie Zang, can you change that weird nickname of yours?”</p>
 <p>“Nickname? There’s nothing wrong with this nickname, Kitten!” Xie Zang walked to Gu Qingyu’s side and patted her on the head. &nbsp;“Sure, let’s leave this afternoon.”</p>
 <p><em>I was not asking for your opinion, thank you!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. “Then you can go and prepare...”</p>
 <p>“I didn’t bring anything anyway.” Xie Zang shrugged nonchalantly. “Kitten, shall we go for a walk together?”</p>
 <p>“No.” Gu Qingyu declined without hesitation.</p>
 <p>“Brother Zhu, let’s go for a walk!” Qi Yichen interjected.</p>
 <p>“There seem to be many rare herbs here.” Mo Bai turned his head slightly and looked at Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu grimaced. “Um... Since you all say so…”</p>
 <p>“Who said we’re bringing them along?” Xie Zang snorted. “Little Kitten, I am not bringing them along.” He paused and gave Mo Bai and Qi Yichen unfriendly looks. “If you guys insist, then I just might have to kill all of you!”</p>
 <p>“Go ahead and try.” Mo Bai curled his lips, a ball of light with green and black swirls glowed from his hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen waved his fan. “To be frank, I hate killing. But if you really want to die, then consider your wish granted!” Qi Yichen always could flip things on their side like that. Even though he was wrong, he could talk down to the other person. This ability was very similar to Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rested her hand under her chin. “Sure, then you guys can go together to fight! Remember to come back before lunch!”</p>
 <p>Xie Zang, Mo Bai, and Qi Yichen glared at each other and walked out of the tavern.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Come back soon!” Gu Qingyu waved at them as they left.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Hey, Little Yu’er.” Jia Qizhe leaned against a pillar with a devilish smirk. “Let’s go.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Go?” Gu Qingyu asked in surprise. “Where are we going?”</p>
 <p>“Those annoying people are finally gone, I’ve been waiting here for a long time.” Jia Qizhe rubbed his temples. “My legs were getting sore, but finally the files are gone.”</p>
 <p><em>Waiting for a long time? You truly had it tough, they are going to fight and you’re just gonna stay here and watch?&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>“Then, what about Qi Wan?” Gu Qingyu checked her surroundings and realized Qi Wan had been absent for a while.</p>
 <p>“Ah, he seemed to be stuck in the toilet.” Jia Qizhe held his forehead with a pensive look in his eyes. “He seemed to be having diarrhea from some strange food!”</p>
 <p><em>Even my toes could tell it was that bowl of porridge!&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu shrugged in defeat. “Then, where are you going? ...Hey, what are you doing, wait, put me down first!”</p>
 <p>“Don’t you like that pretty face, Mo Bai?” Jia Qizhe held Gu Qingyu in his arms as they zipped through the skies. &nbsp;“Um...even if you say so…” Gu Qingyu scratched her head. <em>That's Prince Charming, he’s handsome and kind. It would be weird to not like him!</em></p>
 <p>“It’s okay, I’ll let you take a look at that pretty face’s true nature. And kill off any intentions you had &nbsp;about that stubborn brat, Qi Yichen.” Jia Qizhe’s lips curled, it was not hard to tell that he was in a really good mood.</p>
 <p><em>Pretty face? Brat? Dude, can you even stretch it further?</em></p>
 <p>Actually, he could. Jia Qizhe seemed to have thought of something and looked up slightly. “That’s right, and that sissy Xie Zang too.”</p>
 <p><em>How is he a sissy? How did he offend you?</em></p>
 <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Soon they stopped behind a rock. Gu Qingyu hopped down, there were sounds of explosions in the area, she followed the noise and peered over the rock to get a better look.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Mo Bai’s whole body was covered in a green and black glow. He was suspended in the air, the attacks in his hand flew towards Xie Zang and Qi Yichen.</p>
 <p>Xie Zang smirked. He too was floating in the air with two fireballs burning in his hands. “I actually had not played like this in a long time…”</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen certainly was never going to ally himself with Mo Bai, he joined them in the air and they formed a triangle.</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen glowed with white light, his steel fan was a shining silver in the sun, his white robes billowing behind him, like a pure sage. He watched Mo Bai with a faint smile as he fanned himself.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>He was actually quite surprised, he knew Mo Bai was no ordinary man but Mo Bai’s strength has exceeded his expectations.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Xie Zang narrowed his eyes and threw the two fireballs, aiming for both Mo Bai and Qi Yichen.</p>
 <p>Mo Bai stretched out his hand and released a ball of black light. It collided with and defused Xie Zang’s flames.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen gently pushed his fan, it spun in the air and blocked the attack. Then, with a wave of his hand, he summoned a mysterious tornado and sent it hurtling towards Xie Zang and Mo Bai.</p>
 <p>Xie Zang sent out another fireball to block the tornado, while Mo Bai simply dodged it with a side-step.&nbsp;</p>
