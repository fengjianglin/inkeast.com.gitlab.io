 <p>Jia Qizhe opened his eyes and looked at Gu Qingyu. "Oh, you're out?"</p>
 <p>She nodded. "Yeah."</p>
 <p>"Let's go." He got up and walked away, and didn't ask about any details.</p>
 <p>She frowned and did not follow him. "Don't you have anything to ask?"</p>
 <p>He stopped and turned around, a devious smirk was on his face. "You'll tell me whatever you want to tell me when it's time. And whatever you don't want to tell me, you won't say it even if I asked. Wouldn't you, Xiao Yu'er?" He was right. She nodded and followed him.</p>
 <p>He continued to walk forward. "Now we can finally relax and have some fun. Xiao Yu'er, do you want to go to that room to eat something?"</p>
 <p>"Eh? Is it okay?" She was overjoyed. <em>Is it really ok to embrace this sudden happiness?</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe nodded.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p><strong>In the "Snack house"</strong></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stared at the trio in the room with blank eyes as she pointed dumbly at the empty, clean, spotless room. "Where's all the food?"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan mirrored her expression. "Duh, we ate it."&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Ate?" Gu Qing said with a very angry smile, "You spit it out! If you can't spit it out, dig it out for me!"</p>
 <p>"I thought you've already eaten, Boss..." Qi Wan looked scared.</p>
 <p>"Well, you were wrong!" As always, Qi Wan's explanations were rejected by her. Qi Wan got up and slowly shuffled to her. He stopped in front of her, shook his sleeves, and snacks rained from his sleeves. Gu Qingyu's eyes widened in disbelief.</p>
 <p>"Boss, these are the ones I kept for you specially..." Qi Wan blinked pitifully at Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p>"That's true." Qi Yichen testified as he sat a chair at the side and fanned himself slowly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Eh? Really?" Gu Qingyu immediately picked up the snacks and patted Qi Wan on the shoulder. "Good boy, you didn't forget your roots!"&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Roots...?" Qi Wan looked at Gu Qingyu incredulously.</p>
 <p>"Hey!" Gu Qingyu said gleefully. "Atta boy!" Qi Wan was bewildered at her replies.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu noticed Xiao Qi was sitting at the side, and was completely silent. She immediately walked up to her. "Xiao Qi, what's wrong? Is someone mean to you?"</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi shook her head immediately, looked at Gu Qingyu and smiled. "I'm fine, Xiao Yu. I just want to think about something."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu relented since she said that, and nodded. "Then let's look for the exit. I don't know why, but staying here makes me feel anxious."</p>
 <p>"Boss! This is medicine!" Qi Wan immediately took a pill from his sleeve. "Please take it regularly!"</p>
 <p>"What the hell is this!" Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes.</p>
 <p>"Twenty years of history for treating heart disease! Qi Wan produced, fine indeed!" Qi Wan made a handsome pose.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes again. "You're lucky Mo Bai is not here, otherwise you will be beaten again."</p>
 <p>"Yu'er, did you call for me?" A gentle voice came from behind them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was stunned, and she almost heard Qi Wan's heart pause.</p>
 <p>She turned around and smiled. "What a coincidence? Hahaha, Mo Bai, Qi Wan has a medicine for heart disease and wants to show you~"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu can feel the eyes of despair on her back.</p>
 <p>"Oh? Really." Mo Bai smiled and walked up. "This castle is really big."</p>
 <p>"Yeah," Gu Qingyu nodded. "I think we should leave here soon."&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Yichen agreed with her. "This scholar has a bad hunch..."</p>
 <p>"Don't jinx it!" Qi Wan stuffed a handful of snacks into Qi Yichen's mouth bitterly.</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen chewed and swallowed happily. "It's good, do you have more?"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan looked at him incredulously.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>They saw Xie Zang after they walked out of the room, he actually bowed slightly to Gu Qingyu. "Thank you."</p>
 <p>"It's nothing." Gu Qingyu nodded, "Is she okay?"</p>
 <p>"She's much better." Xie Zang looked very happy. "I'm going to ring her and leave this place for a while. I'll be back."</p>
 <p>"For a while?" Gu Qingyu blinked doubtfully</p>
 <p>Xie Zang continued. "I'll take my leave. You can come and go anywhere in this place. If you want to leave, just go to the top of the castle."</p>
 <p>"Thank you. We'll wait for you to come back, remember to catch up with us." Gu Qingyu smiled.</p>
 <p>Xie Zang nodded and went out.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu exhaled and showed a comfortable smile.</p>
 <p>Qi Wan watched Xie Zang as he left with confusion. He turned to ask Gu Qingyu, who was beside him. "What are you two talking about?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at Qi Wan and smiled. "All you need to know, is that we can relax now."</p>
 <p>"Really?" Qi Wan was as excited as a puppy.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu nodded. "Of course...not. Psyche." Qi Wan's face collapsed&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Have a good day's rest today, and we will resume the adventure tomorrow morning." Gu Qingyu gazed at the endless grassland outside the window.</p>
 <p>"Sounds good, but where are we going?" Xiao Qi asked.</p>
 <p>Her question caused Gu Qingyu to take in a sharp breath. <em>Oh, that's what I forgot. I forgot to ask Yan Zun where the next Spirit Gem is!</em></p>
 <p>"Hm, more sightseeing." Gu Qingyu took Qi Yichen's fan to fan herself as Qi Yichen tried to snatch the fan back.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu dodged his hands by moving the fan away from him. "Don't fight me on this! How are we going to relax and play if you keep acting like this!"</p>
 <p>"I don't want to play with you!" Qi Yichen pouted. Gu Qingyu sighed and returned the fan to him.</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu jumped down from the second floor and looked at the crowd with a puzzled expression. "Did I miss something?"</p>
 <p>"No, no." Qi Wan blinked. "Xie Zang seemed to have left. We can play at ease now."</p>
 <p>His explanation confused Murong Zuoyu further instead.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu also nodded. "Play at ease, and we'll leave early tomorrow morning." She took Xiao Qi's hand and waved at the others. "Gather at the top of the castle tomorrow morning?"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Wait a minute." Jia Qizhe suddenly grabbed her hand and he looked at Gu Qingyu with a smile. "Xiao Yu'er, don't you think this is a great opportunity to train?"</p>
 <p>"Actually, yes!" <em>The giant castle and the endless grassland outside, it's the best location for sparring!</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu immediately gathered everyone excitedly. "Come, let's have a martial arts competition!"</p>
 <p>"How are we competing?" Murong Zuoye showed a rare display of curiosity.</p>
 <p>"Well, we could split into teams." Gu Qingyu mused, "Because one-on-one would just be too exhausting. But how are we going to split?"</p>
 <p>"Boss, I wanna pair up with you!" Qi Wan's hand shot into the air.</p>
 <p>"Look at yourself." Qi Yichen glanced at Qi Wan with disdain, and then immediately ran to Gu Qingyu. "Brother Zhu, pair up with me!"</p>
 <p>Her heart sank at his enthusiasm. <em>Soon, Qi Yichen will find out his powers are gone</em></p>
 <p>Mo Bai stepped in and said to Qi Yichen: "Your injury has not healed completely, it's not good to fight now."</p>
 <p>"Eh? Don't be such a wet blanket..." Qi Yichen was dismayed at Mo Bai's advice.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Hahaha, we'll let you join next time, ok?" Gu Qingyu finally managed to get Qi Yichen to sit down, albeit reluctantly. She stuffed a handful of sunflower seeds into his hand and flashed a grateful smile at Mo Bai. He returned her with a gentle smile.</p>
 <p>"Then Boss is mine!" Qi Wan smiled happily.</p>
 <p>"Dream on." Jia Qizhe yanked Gu Qingyu to his side. "Pick someone else."</p>
 <p>"We should still ask her what she thinks." Mo Bai's soft eyes looked at Gu Qingyu expectantly.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi also tightened her grip, she had made her choice as well. &nbsp;Even Murong Zuoyu looked at Gu Qingyu with some kind of expectation. Gu Qingyu instantly felt that she was a kindergarten teacher, surrounded by her students, who were all fighting for her attention.</p>
 <p>After a long silence, she spread her hands. "We'll draw lots! Two people in a group!"</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe groaned in dissatisfaction, waved his sleeve, and soon, six picks appeared in the air.</p>
 <p>"Six sticks..." Gu Qingyu muttered, "If Qi Yichen is here, then someone would on their own."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded.</p>
 <p>"It's a pity that Xie Zang is not here, or we would fit two tables of mahjong." Gu Qingyu sighed and shook her head, then she grabbed a stick. The stick slowly changed its color, it turned red. The other also took their sticks one after another. Jia Qizhe took the last stick and held it at the center of his palm.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Who is... red?" Gu Qingyu carefully looked around.</p>
 <p>"Of course it's me, Xiao Yu'er." Jia Qizhe had a cunning smirk.</p>
 <p>"..." <em>Do you dare to say that you didn't sabotage this?</em></p>
 <p>Mo Bai looked at her with a blank expression. "Yu'er, I am also red."</p>
 <p><em>Mo Bai’s inner monologue. “Huh, you think you're the only one who can sabotage the results?”</em></p>
 <p>Something tugged at the corners of her lips, and she broke into a beaming grin. "Oh, that's great, then you two are in one group!"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Yu'er, what about you?" Jia Qizhe was stunned. Mo Bai didn't expect that Gu Qingyu would react like this, so he was startled as well.</p>
 <p>"Me," Gu Qingyu let out an evil chuckle. "Mine is black." The colour of the stick in her hand changed with a spell. <em>Huh, you think you're the only one who can sabotage the results?</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe's complexion changed, and Mo Bai's complexion also changed, but neither of them could go back on their word.</p>
 <p>"What a coincidence." Murong Zuoyu looked up from his stick. "Me too, Brother Zhu."</p>
 <p>"Yeah, it's a coincidence~" Gu Qingyu laughed. But she suddenly realised--<em>If Jia Qizhe and Mo Bai are in one group, and she and Murong Zuoyu are in another, won't that leave Xiao Qi and Qi Wan together?</em></p>
 <p>She glanced over immediately. But Xiao Qi was not as happy as she thought, while Qi Wan shook his head and sighed, "What can I say?"&nbsp;</p>
