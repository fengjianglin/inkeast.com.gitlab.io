 <p>At noon, everyone came to the palace where Gu Qingyu currently lives. Xie Zang was really efficient. Gu Qingyu nodded with satisfaction, and before she could react, she realized that Qi Wan had wrapped his arms around her neck.</p>
 <p>"Boss~ Not seeing you for a day feels like 3 autumns have gone by. I've not seen you for 2 days, that means I've not seen you for 6 autumns!" Qi Wan said with tears in his eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay, okay." Gu Qingyu was about to pry off his hands, then she saw the blue light gathering in Jia Qizhe's hand. Qi Wan released her immediately.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>I've only been away for two days, but they've already missed me so much.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rubbed her eyes and turned to Xiao Qi. "We should get ready, Xiao Qi. Someone would like to meet you." She paused. "The rest of you can wait for me here. "</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Okay." Xiao Qi walked over and took Gu Qingyu's hand weakly. "Xiao Yu, what's happening?"</p>
 <p>"Nothing, you'll be delighted once you meet that person." Gu Qingyu rubbed Xiao Qi's head and they walked to Bei Cheng’s palace. The guards and maids on the way saluted to Gu Qingyu, which surprised Xiao Qi a little. Momo, who led the way, stopped at the doors leading to the main hall. She bowed slightly, "Sir, Miss, please."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu and Xiao Qi walked in. Bei Cheng sat on the golden and brilliant chair, and at the sight of Gu Qingyu, his eyes lit up immediately.</p>
 <p>"This is Xiao Qi." Gu Qingyu pointed to Xiao Qi.</p>
 <p>The way Gu Qingyu introduced her, it almost made Xiao Qi feel that she was going to sell her away.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Beicheng smiled at Xiao Qi slightly. "Is your full name Xun Qi?"</p>
 <p>"Yes." Xiao Qi was less fearful, she remembered that Gu Qingyu was right next to her.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Do you have... two red moles on your shoulder?" Bei Cheng said hesitantly. After all, the person before him was a girl that he had never met, and he was not sure if she was his sister. It would be quite rude to ask such a question.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Who knows, Xiao Qi nodded immediately. "Yes!"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi." Bei Cheng choked on his words a little. "I'm your older brother."</p>
 <p>"Brother..." Xiao Qi looked at Bei Cheng doubtfully.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu knowingly stepped out from the main hall. Before she closed the doors, she winked at Bei Cheng. 'Come on! Take the chance!'</p>
 <p>Beicheng saw her, but proceeded to ignore her message.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu then walked back to her palace.</p>
 <p>"Brother Zhu, how is it?" Qi Yichen was the first to speak when Gu Qingyu returned. "Brother Xie has told us, how did it go?"</p>
 <p>"It should be, the rest depends on Qian Cheng." Gu Qingyu nodded and then flipped her hair. "It's been two days, my boys. Have you missed me?"</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Qi Wan shouted.</p>
 <p>Two large bumps were quickly added to his forehead, and Jia Qizhe slowly rubbed his hands as he calmly sauntered to Gu Qingyu's side. "Little Yu'er, did you miss me?"</p>
 <p>"Yes!" Gu Qingyu shouted immediately.</p>
 <p>"Well, good." He ran his fingers along her hair. "Did you get the Spirit Gem?"</p>
 <p>"Well, he would probably give it to us after meeting Xiao Qi... " Gu Qingyu rubbed her nose, it was clear that she felt guilty for not getting the Spirit Gem yet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Hm..." Jia Qizhe nodded as he glanced out of the window. "After three days, the rain finally stopped."</p>
 <p>"Yeah." Gu Qingyu answered, she too was looking out the window.</p>
 <p>"Boss, is it fun here?" Qi Wan asked.</p>
 <p>"Fun?" Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. "Just a look is enough for me, I'm still not suited for the palace, with all the politics and everything."&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Her statement has caused several of them to look away.</p>
 <p>"Someone bullied you?" Murong Zuoyu said, his tone bone-chillingly cold.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Ah, it's not..." Gu Qingyu started.</p>
 <p>"Isn't it? Someone wanted to slap my kitten." Xie Zang cut her off and sighed. "My kitten had it tough these days."</p>
 <p>"Eh eh, actually, nothing really happened... Huh? Where's Jia Qizhe? And Mo Bai too? Even Murong Zuoyu... they were all here just now!"</p>
 <p>"Alas, I was just rambling about it, I didn't expect them to be so serious." Xie Zang sighed and shook his head. "But that did happen, right?"</p>
 <p>"Well, it did..." Gu Qingyu nodded. "Wait! You still have to stop them! Otherwise, there'll be a big mess in the palace!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu, Xie Zang, Qi Yichen, and Qi Wan ran out and saw Jia Qizhe, Mo Bai, and Murong Zuoyu walking back towards them.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Ah?" Gu Qingyu has yet to connect the dots.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu said coldly. "Left side, five assassins. All dead."</p>
 <p>Mo Bai gave her a gentle smile. "Right side, eight assassins. All dead."</p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe had a cunning grin instead. "Above, ten assassins. All dead."</p>
 <p><em>Excuse Me? Did something interesting happen just now?</em></p>
 <p>"Really, it takes you just two days to get into trouble." Jia Qizhe looked at the gate of Beicheng's palace. "They're out."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu followed his gaze. Sure enough, Bei Cheng walked in front with a wide smile on his face. Xiao Qi was bashful but clearly happy. She fell in step behind Bei Cheng.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu clapped her hands. 'Yes! Job well done!"</p>
 <p>The way she rejoiced at the news gave off the impression of an old matchmaker celebrating another successful case.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"How would Xiao Qi choose..." Gu Qingyu blinked, looking at the direction of Bei Cheng and Xiao Qi leaving.</p>
 <p><em>Continue their journey with her? Or, stay here? The latter seems more likely...</em></p>
 <p>"I think she will choose you." Qi Yichen waved his fan and smiled. "After all, Brother Zhu, you are so heroic... Wait, does that make you the brother-in-law of the Emperor of Beiying?"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was stunned for a while. "I think so!" <em>She is Xiao Qi's 'husband', so if Xiao Qi became a princess, wouldn't I be a prince consort? I get excited just thinking about it!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Yichen nodded. "Let's wait a minute, we will know the answer in the afternoon."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu agreed. "Before that, let’s grab lunch."</p>
 <p>"Boss, just what are you made of? You could eat so much and still not gain weight." Qi Wan eyed her suspiciously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Me? I'm still growing." Gu Qingyu answered with a straight face. "Qi Wan, there should be one of your restaurants around here right?"</p>
 <p>Qi Wan nodded. "Yeah, but boss, what do you want to do..." Gu Qingyu smiled mysteriously.</p>
 <p>"Boss, that kind of smile from you really worries me, you know that?" Qi Wan swallowed weakly.</p>
 <p>"That’s your only clue, figure it out yourself. " Gu Qingyu smiled mysteriously again. "Let's go!"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Qi Wan soon realized what Gu Qingyu meant. He sulked as he looked at the glorious spread at their table, he could only feel the burning hole in his pocket.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Yum! Qi Wan, the restaurant you opened is really good!" Gu Qingyu nodded with food between her chopsticks. "Thank you so much!"</p>
 <p>"Not at all! Everything for our Boss! "Qi Wan said between sniffles, his tear streaks were so wide, they looked like two strips of noodles. "Boss, as long as you’re happy! "</p>
 <p>"Well." Gu Qingyu said between bites. "After this, we will go back to the palace. It'll be afternoon by then. And we'll take the Spirit Gem. If Xiao Qi wants to stay here, no one is allowed to stop her. "</p>
 <p>"That wouldn't be the case." Xie Zang curled his lips. "But if you, kitten, want to stay here, a group of people would rush into the palace. Of course, including myself."</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu didn't want to say much, so she concentrated on eating.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Their table was soon cleared, all the food on their table entered Gu Qingyu's stomach. Everyone stared at her with wide eyes, they did not expect that this woman to eat so much.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu swallowed her last bite and gracefully dabbed the corners of her mouth with a napkin. "Well, about 70%, good enough."</p>
 <p>70%? Qi Wan stared at her, completely frozen. Without moving, he said to Qi Yichen, "Brother Qi, give me a slap, I need to wake up."</p>
 <p>"Okay, no problem." Qi Yichen was also stunned, and he slapped himself instead. "Does it hurt?"</p>
 <p>"No, it's really a dream..."</p>
 <p>"Hey, dumb and dumber." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes and got up. "Let's go, children!"</p>
 <p><em>Children?&nbsp;</em>Everyone present at the scene turned to her.</p>
 <p>"What are you staring at? Child... eh, Hero Jia, we can always talk things out... " Gu Qingyu saw Jia Qizhe's stern face and immediately caved.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>After returning to the palace, Gu Qingyu nursed the two large bumps on her head as she walked to Bei Cheng's palace. As soon as the door was opened, a woman dressed in pale yellow clothes stood at the door, golden hair pins covered in gemstones adorned her hair. She turned around. "Xiao Yu!"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi?" Gu Qingyu stunned for a moment, then a wide smile stretched across her face. "You look gorgeous!"</p>
 <p>"R-really?" Xiao Qi smiled shyly. "Emperor… Elder brother crowned me the princess of the country."</p>
 <p>"Wow, that's really amazing!" Gu Qingyu patted Xiao Qi's head. "Then Xiao Qi, do you want to stay here?"</p>
 <p>"Xiao Qi don't want it! Xiao Qi is going to follow Xiao Yu!" Xiao Qi held onto Gu Qingyu’s sleeve anxiously.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Okay, silly girl." Gu Qingyu stroked Xiao Qi's head. "As long as you want to follow me. Why would I leave you...Qian Cheng?"</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>She tilted her head to look at Bei Cheng sitting next to them. Bei Cheng nodded and smiled gently at Xiao Qi. "Sister, go. You can come home whenever you feel tired. And you will always be my princess." He then turned to Gu Qingyu. "You're always welcomed as well... Qingyu."</p>
 <p>"Thank you, Qian Cheng." Gu Qingyu smiled and watched Bei Cheng pull out a glass gem from his sleeve.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"This is the Water Spirit Gem that I promised to give you." Beicheng handed the Spirit Gem to Gu Qingyu. "Keep it well."</p>
 <p>"Okay." Gu Qingyu took the Water Spirit Gem and carefully tucked it away.</p>
 <p>"Qingyu, I don't know what you need to do with the Spirit Gems... But I know that your quest, your mission is very difficult. Come back and see me, once you have completed it." Bei Cheng squeezed out a smile, his face pale. "I hope the token can help you. With the token, you will have unimpeded access in all of Beiying and you can represent me in other countries. "</p>
 <p>"I will come to see you. But I won't use the token, because that is a souvenir from you." Gu Qingyu smiled and smacked firmly on Beicheng's shoulder. "Goodbye, Qian Cheng." She turned and walked out of the Imperial Palace of Beiying, Xiao Qi followed behind her.</p>
