<div class="jfontsize_content fr-view"> 
 <p>The dust settled and the white mist dispersed, and the silhouette of a behemoth creature appeared. It looked like a tiger, but its fur was white. It was extremely huge and surrounded by white mist. The white tiger turned its head, its tail whipped fiercely and swept away the assassins around Mo Bai. Mo Bai and Qi Yichen seemed safe and sound. Qi Yichen gawked at the sight of the giant white tiger. "Is this... Brother Zhu?"</p>
 <p>"It seems so." Mo Bai looked at the white tiger, he too was surprised.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The demon was enraged, it snarled and charged to the white tiger. The white tiger opened its mouth and roared. The skies and the earth shook, and the demon stepped back and surrendered.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>……</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu opened her eyes and found herself far away from the ground.</p>
 <p>"I grew taller?" Gu Qingyu thought aloud, but instead of her own voice, a low rumble came out from her mouth.</p>
 <p><em>What's that sound?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu was puzzled and raised her hand, but found that it was a white... paw?<em>&nbsp;No, it’s not a cat’s paw, it's bigger… Add the roar just now to the equation… Am I a tiger now?!</em></p>
 <p>The only thought on her mind was a crushing sense of anxiety. <em>I've just exposed myself! But wasn't I a Cat Demon? Why am I a tiger now?</em></p>
 <p>She looked down and saw Qi Yichen looking up at her in horror, while the demon was rushing towards her. Xiao Qi and Qi Yichen were beside her. She couldn't care so much, she immediately stretched out her paws and picked up everyone, her tail swept off the spider silk that had wrapped around Jia Qizhe. The demon was irritated, it roared and flew towards her.</p>
 <p><em>You think you're the only one that knows how to roar? What, you want to compare who has a louder voice?&nbsp;</em>She opened its mouth and roared back. Lo and behold, the demon was really scared! It took two steps back and lowered its head.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Great!" Gu Qingyu grew impressed with herself, but all Mo Bai and Xiao Qi heard was a loud purring from the white tiger.</p>
 <p>"Is that... Xiao Yu?" Xiao Qi asked carefully.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu lowered her head, looked at Xiao Qi on her palm. She then turned around, put them next to Qi Wan and Murong Zuoyu with a nod. Xiao Qi ran up to her immediately, she looked a little excited and wrapped her arms around one of her.&nbsp; "Xiao Yu! So you're not a cat!"</p>
 <p>"Yes! I think so too!" Gu Qingyu was also very excited, but her excitement translated to a growl, which messed up Xiao Qi's hairstyle...</p>
 <p>"Brother Zhu, I know you are excited," Qi Yichen stroked the fur on her paw. "Be calm, Brother Jia is still in the demon's hands..."</p>
 <p>When Gu Qingyu thought of Jia Qizhe, she immediately looked angrily at the demon, and it took two steps back again. Suddenly, a blue light flashed, and then a figure jumped up from behind the demon! It's Jia Qizhe!</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was elated to see him and she roared again. Qi Yichen, who was standing at her foot, was buffeted by the sudden gust of wind and spit. He wiped his face with his sleeves. "Brother, pay attention to your image, you sprayed some saliva on me..."</p>
 <p>The white tiger rumbled unhappily, Qi Yichen stroked her paw again. "Relax, Hero Jia is fine, you can be excited now..."</p>
 <p>Before he finished his sentence, the paw next to him shifted. Gu Qingyu pressed Qi Yichen to the ground, leaned into his face and then gave an earth-shattering roar—Qi Yichen was completely dazed.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>"Has she finally transformed?" Jia Qizhe still had the sword in his hand, and his expression was indifferent. Blood still dribbled from the wound in his chest and his face was pale. The blue light overflowed from his hand as he slashed and attacked the demon.</p>
 <p>The assassins appeared again, and Jia Qizhe patted Gu Qingyu's paw. "Good. Let's see what you can do." Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes in disdain. In fact, she also wanted to see how powerful she really was, so she walked towards those assassins. However, the sight of this white tiger rolling its eyes has completely changed from disdain to cute and moe in the eyes of Jia Qizhe and others...</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen rearranged his hairstyle helplessly and gently smacked his ears, they were still ringing from the roar. "We're both handsome guys, why is there such a double standard?"</p>
 <p>"Because Xiao Yu'er likes me." Jia Qizhe raised an eyebrow. Although he was answering Qi Yichen's question, he was looking at Mo Bai. Mo Bai glanced at him lightly, holding the jade flute in his hand without saying a word. His eyes returned to Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was giving her all. When she saw a bunch of assassins flying towards her, she smacked them directly with a paw and brought them all down. No matter how skilled these assassins were, they were still greatly outclassed by the behemoth creature before them.</p>
 <p>One of the assassins had lost his patience. He held a sword in his hand, stepped on the shoulder of his companion and flew up, shouting, "Die!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu stretched out another paw and swiped at him gently, the assassin was pinned to the ground by her paw. And then, she roared at that assassin, right in his face. The assassin's eyes rolled into his skull and he passed out. Other assassins all took a step back as they watched their compatriot. They were not afraid of dying from being swiped at. Although it was not the most glorious to die, it still meant that they contributed, right? But, based on what happened to their compatriot, will the tiger before them give them such torture should it get more upset?</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen watched Gu Qingyu as he sweated bullets. <em>Brother Zhu, I love you! I finally know how kind you are to me!</em></p>
 <p><em>This small incident told us that should you encounter something unsatisfactory or difficult and frustrating, don't be discouraged and don't give up. Compared with those more unfortunate people, you will suddenly feel a ray of bright sunshine shining into your life. (Note: Please refer to Qi Yichen's experience for more details.)</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>At the same time, Mo Bai flew towards the Spider Queen, his hand twisted and turned in the air. The Spider Queen immediately backed away, her fingers interlaced and she weaved web after web. Xiao Qi walked quickly to Qi Wan, and poured her bottle of medicine into his mouth. Qi Wan coughed and slowly opened his eyes.</p>
 <p>"Boss..." Qi Wan croaked as he looked up.</p>
 <p>Xiao Qi wiped her eyes. "She's fine." She gritted her teeth and took out another bottle of medicine. She turned around and gave the medicine Murong Zuoyu. Murong Zuoyu frowned slightly and regained consciousness.</p>
 <p>&nbsp;</p>
 <p><strong>Meanwhile</strong></p>
 <p>Black gas suddenly burst from Mo Bai's hands as he strangled the Spider Queen fiercely, the black gas surrounded her and threatened to swallow her. The Spider Queen was startled. She realised that she was about to be captured alive and tried to end her own life, but she could not move a single muscle. The anger in Mo Bai's eyes dissipated, and he released his grip. Thick black chains shackled the Spider Queen. &nbsp;Mo Bai turned his head to look at Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu was having the time of her life, her paws slapped around as she looked at the assassins under her paws like ants. She held back her strength, most of the assassins were knocked out from the impact, she was more focused on disrupting and distracting the assassins instead.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Retreat!" Shouted a man who looked like the leader, and the others fled at his command.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>As the assassins retreated, Gu Qingyu turned around and yawned lazily. She looked at Qi Yichen. There was another rumbling from the back of her throat. "You know so much, Qi Yichen, how do I change back?"</p>
 <p>Qi Yichen watched her with a frown, but Jia Qizhe miraculously understood her. "You should automatically turn back when you are tired."</p>
 <p>"Grrrr..." <em>But I am tired!</em></p>
 <p>"Then use your mind, like summoning a weapon." Jia Qizhe nodded.</p>
 <p>"Grrrr..."<em>&nbsp;I tried, it doesn't work!</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe finally couldn't bear it. He stepped on his sword, flew up and stared at her at eye level.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>His hand knocked her head again and again. "Change back! Focus on changing back! Don't get distracted! Change, change, and change back quickly!"</p>
 <p>He knocked on her head after each word. It irritated her and she growled, and before she finished growling, she felt dizzy. As she lowered her head, the ground seemed to be getting closer and closer to her... <em>Am I turning back?</em></p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before she could react, Gu Qingyu found herself ridiculously to the ground.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>"Grrrr..."<em>&nbsp;What's going on? Why didn't I turn back?</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe landed and stretched out his hand to Gu Qingyu.</p>
 <p><em>Since when is Jia Qizhe so big?&nbsp;</em>Gu Qingyu looked at him cautiously, and immediately backed away. <em>My hand, it's still a paw?</em></p>
 <p>Jia Qizhe easily picked her up. He patted Gu Qingyu's head and waved his sleeves. A mirror appeared in the air immediately. In the mirror was a handsome man in a blue robe holding a cat. No, a mini white tiger.</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu looked at herself in the mirror with surprise, her eyes became as wide as saucers. Such wide-eyed looks were undoubtedly absolutely adorable. Qi Wan got up, although his face was pale but he was out of danger. He looked at Gu Qingyu with a wretched look. "Boss, karma is truly a cycle! I didn't expect you to become like this!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu glared at Qi Wan fiercely, but there was no deterrent. Qi Wan tied his hair. "Okay, stop acting cute. Although you are really cute now, there is no intimidation power whatsoever..."</p>
 <p><br></p>
 <p>Before he finished his sentence, Gu Qingyu broke free from Jia Qizhe's arm. She lunged at Qi Wan and bit his nose. Qi Wan wailed, but seeing that Gu Qingyu was about to fall. He immediately extended his hand to catch her while he covered his face with the other hand. "Boss, you're so mean! My nose! I almost died just now, you know?"</p>
 <p>"Haven't you heard the phrase 'the smaller they are, the more vicious they get'?" Qi Yichen fanned himself and looked at Qi Wan with sympathy.</p>
 <p>"What?" Qi Wan's face was incredulous. "To think that there will be a day where my handsome face would be ruined!"</p>
 <p>Gu Qingyu rolled her eyes. She felt sore all over, probably because she had overexerted herself. So she closed her eyes and fell asleep.</p>
 <p>"Oh my god, you ruined my face and now you dare to sleep?" Qi Wan stared at the mini white tiger in his hand.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Everyone looked at him with a pitiful look. Jia Qizhe came over and took Gu Qingyu from Qi Wan. "I'll carry her. Take heed, things that are lost can no longer be recovered. My condolences."</p>
 <p>Qi Wan spat back. "My face can still heal!"</p>
 <p>"Oh, by the way." Xiao Qi pointed at the Spider Queen, "What are we going to do about her?"</p>
 <p>Murong Zuoyu sat up and looked at the mini white tiger with some awe.</p>

 <p>So turns out, Gu Qingyu was not your average cat demon, but a White Tiger! Traditionally, the White Tiger is one of the Four Symbols or Four Auspicious Beasts in Chinese Mythology. I won’t go into much detail, since more would be explained in the next chapter.</p>
