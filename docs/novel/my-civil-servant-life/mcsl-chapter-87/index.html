 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While we were on our way to find the second suspect, the burden reached his hand towards me and said, "Hand it over!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hand what over?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His demeanor, along with his face, gave the impression of a gangster trying to mug someone. "The badge! Hey, you ass! You were impersonating a knight! That's a felony! Do you want to eat oatmeal for the rest of your life?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the burden asked if I wanted to eat oatmeal, it was like asking if I wanted to eat rice with beans in my past life. It was an idiom that arose from the fact that oatmeal wasn’t eaten even in the slums but was served as the main diet in imperial prisons.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I clicked my tongue. "</span><span style="font-style: italic">Tsk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Here."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden growled as he took the badge, "You'll pay for this when we get back."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I just snorted, "Try it. I'm going to say that you were an accomplice."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"...What?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at the bewildered burden, I gave a victorious smile. "Think about it. The captain is definitely going to believe that a weak civil servant trainee like me stole a badge from the vice-captain."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, that's-"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Even if he were to believe you, you'd be in trouble for allowing a weak civil servant trainee like me to steal it from you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden was speechless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If you're going to get punished no matter what, it’d be better just to keep your mouth shut. If we don’t say anything, who’s going to find out? Oh, the owner of the alchemy workshop just now? If we say the same story, we can bury such testimony. Huhuhu." For some reason, I felt like a devil dragging him down an immoral path, but it didn't really matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden shouted, conflicted, "Look at what you’ve done! If that guy from before files a complaint, I'll be disciplined!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The complaint that the burden was talking about was not regarding the fake identity but the sudden raid. Come to think of it; the first suspect definitely had enough for a complaint. We suddenly broke the door, accused him of being a drug offender without evidence, then conducted a search without consent and exposed his secret porn stash. I think I'd file a complaint, too.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's alright. It's none of my business," I shrugged. &nbsp;The burden’s face showed a flash of anger, and he clenched his fist but then relaxed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he were really going to hit me, I would have yelled, "You gonna hit me?" and "Neighborhood people!" but what a shame.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden shouted as if he had realized something, "No way! Are you still sulking because I made fun of you for not being able to draw a map?!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden looked at me as if he was shocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahahaha! No way,” I laughed and kicked the door of the second suspect's alchemy workshop.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">Kwang</span><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Just like</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;before, the door broke into pieces and flew away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Get over here!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"See, you're upset!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>No, I said I wasn’t. Jeez, the burden really doesn't believe what people say. S</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">till, he had good intuition as a detective. How unhelpful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I grasped the collar of the second suspect, who was in the midst of fleeing just like the first suspect.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you Mr. Dwen?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having his collar suddenly grabbed before he could speak, the second suspect nodded in panic. "Can, can you let go?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I ignored the second suspect and spoke, "There have been reports that you've been manufacturing and distributing drugs here. If you obediently cooperate with the search, there will be no bloodshed."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What the hell!" The second suspect turned pale, and the burden frowned like he knew this would happen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reason I was so aggressive now compared to the first suspect was that the burden had taken back the White Deer Knights badge. I secretly shot a glance at the burden, and he sighed, showing his badge.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I let go of the second suspect's collar and headed inside without delay.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wa, wait!" The second suspect reached out and tried to grab me, but I easily dodged and started searching the entire workshop.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The layout of the workshop was similar to the first suspect’s, Capol. So, this was the popular style of alchemy workshop in the capital. If Yuria later said that she wanted to learn alchemy properly, then a place like this could be useful. After all, I'm also part of a new generation that's quite style-conscious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unfortunately, in the alchemy workshop, Nepenthes’s digestive fluid could be found, but not the blood of the giant ice troll. The second suspect was sadly not the culprit. I felt a little anxious about whether I was going in the wrong direction, but it was too late to change course now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I looked around the workshop and searched for a secret space again. The floor, ceiling, and walls were the three places where mana was roughly gathered. I approached the secret space in the wall, which had the most mana aggregated there of the three, and ripped off the wallpaper.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No!" The second suspect shouted, but the burden blocked him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the surface, this was a drug investigation. The burden wore a reluctant expression, but no matter if it was for me or to catch the real criminal, he was doing a good job.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Come out, hidden porn stash!" I chanted an incantation and dispelled the magic on the wall. I opened the door to the secret space, hoping that paradise would welcome me again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What is this?" I asked. The secret space was full of sacks containing some white powder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This bastard was actually a real drug offender.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The second suspect retreated from the burden when I took out the sack of drugs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Keuk</span><span>! I don't know how you figured it out, but you’d better regret the fact that only two of you came here!” When the second suspect uttered a typical villain's line, gangsters crawled up from the secret space on</span><span>&nbsp;the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Surrounded by the gangsters, the burden stepped forward to protect me and drew his sword, saying, "Damn it, I shouldn't have gotten involved with a guy like you!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he looked like he was truly regretting it, his desire as a knight to protect me was still admirable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm gonna need to have you guys spill where you got the information.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was laughable to see the second suspect shout in triumph.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Make sure to stick close behind me. I think it's going to be hard to protect you against this many people,” I sighed and continued, "After a good night's sleep, it'll be all over."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I secretly showed the gas mask to the burden, who looked back at it. Then I took out the sleeping bomb I made in the village from my pocket space and shook it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You! Wait!" As soon as the burden felt something ominous and was about to say something, I threw it at the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Have a taste of my bomb!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Pang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sleeping bomb hit the floor and gave off the sound of a small explosion before it began to release sleeping gas.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What, what is that?!” The gangsters panicked, but it was too late.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The gas filled the room in an instant, causing everyone in the workshop to collapse except for me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Nice. It works well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Actually, I had made this sleeping bomb in anticipation of leaving home, but it wasn't until I finished making it that I realized that I had to go outdoors to escape. Inevitably, this type of bomb worked well indoors, but not so much outside. Furthermore, the sleeping bomb worked by entering the respiratory tract, but considering the lung capacity of those from the village, it was essentially useless. Honestly, I don't know why I made it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition to sleeping bombs, I had many different types of flash bangs, tear gas, and smoke bombs, but if I had put a little more thought into it, I would’ve realized they weren’t useful for escaping. Back then, perhaps due to my youth, I made a lot of these useless things.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I pulled out a rope I bought in Granwell and tied the drug offenders' arms and legs. Just in case, I strengthened the rope with magic then took the military supply map from the drooling burden.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm going to borrow this for a moment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ah, I can finally ditch this burden. Just to make sure, let's take the map so he can’t follow me. I chose to use the sleeping bomb because I wanted to hide my strength as much as possible, and also, it was easier to get rid of the burden this way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After catching the criminal, I would have to torture him behind the scenes. It would have been annoying if he showed a sense of justice when we interrogated the suspect. I left the workshop before people reported the smoke and the guards showed up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The captain of the White Deer knight division was working on a report to present to his superiors regarding&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant’s</span><span>&nbsp;attempted poisoning. Although the captain was the highest rank in the capital’s security,&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was a senior member of Prime Minister Arcanta’s secret intelligence organization and was his direct subordinate. In other words, the report he was writing now was going up to Arcanta.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The captain stopped writing the report and sighed, "Why did I let him leave?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He was referring to Den, the man arrested on the spot as the prime suspect. Ever since he was told that Den knew about the Big Mama Information Agency, he began to feel a strange sense of trust. Thus, he assigned his most trusted subordinate to keep watch over him. He admired Den's clever ways of speaking, as he would have never allowed this to happen normally.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same time, he began to worry about what to write in the report. He wasn't aware of it, but he was being hypnotized by magic ever since he had the strange sense of trust in Den's words. Now there was not even a speck of magic left for evidence, but still, there was an intangible remaining feeling of trust.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The gratitude for saving Pelgrant's life amplified the sense of trust, but it would fade in a few days. However, as he began to go over Den in the report, he wasn’t sure what to write.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he sighed again, his subordinate shouted in an urgent voice and came into the office. "Captain! There’s a big problem!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What's going on?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There is smoke suspected to be toxic gas rising from within the capital!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How's it being handled?” Though the captain’s voice was as calm as usual, his composure was bound to be broken due to his subordinate’s words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Everyone who inhaled a little bit of the smoke has lost consciousness, so they aren’t able to deal with it right now. However, some eyewitnesses said the vice-captain entered the area before the smoke showed up."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What! Where is this?" The captain urgently asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His subordinate informed him that this occurred at Dwen’s alchemy workshop. As soon as he heard the location, the captain quickly left his office and headed to the scene. The captain started to get a headache as he hurried to his destination. The man assigned to watch Den while he tried to catch the criminals had gone to that workshop.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Thus, the person in the workshop was either the criminal or a suspect. In other words, the suspected toxic gas may have to be considered as a kind of terrorism rather than just an accident in an alchemy workshop. Whether it was a terrorist attack or an accident, he just wanted the vice-captain to be safe.</span></p>
