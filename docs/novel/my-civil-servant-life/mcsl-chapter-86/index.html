 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As I walked quickly, I took out a map of the capital from my coat and drew Director Pelgrant’s movements from today on top of it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What’s that scribble?" The vice-captain asked. My will to ignore the noisy burden following me was reaching its limit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's a map of the capital."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I looked at the burden as if saying, ‘you didn’t even know that?’ Yet, the burden laughed at me with a "</span><span style="font-style: italic">poot</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">" sound.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's a map? Even a child can draw better than that."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">How dare you spit out such ludicrous words? This map was meticulously copied from the one bought at the Big Mama Information Agency. What, could it be that you had two lives?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite the map’s appearance, I proudly thought that I was better than my Uncle Bloody, the man known as the village’s best artist. How dare you injure my pride? This was especially valid when considering that you're only a burden.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Poot</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, are you mad? Still, that’s too far. A map should at least look like this." After saying this, the burden took out a piece of paper from his bosom.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although I was angry, just one glance told me that it was a much more sophisticated map than the one I drew. It was still lacking compared to the map I bought at the Granwell branch of the Big Mama Information Agency, but with its detailed side roads, it was a map for military use.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I snatched the map from the burden’s hand with a quick flourish. It was quite a sight to see him shocked. He probably hadn’t even imagined that it might be taken away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hey, that's only for manager-level use!" The burden tried to snatch the map from my hand, but of course, that was not possible.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This man was weaker than my eldest sister, the one with the lowest constitution in the village. Despite this, he tried taking the map even though it was still a hundred years too early. If he wanted to take the map from me, he’d at least need to have the power of my big brother or the quickness of my younger brother.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">More importantly, this map must really be military supplies. If I told the knight captain that I took his vice-captain’s map, it might not be enough for imprisonment, but it was probably enough for a demotion. Then, let's use it gratefully. I drew Director Pelgrant’s movements on the map.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahhhh! I told you that was military supply! Damn it! Losing or damaging military supply is punished with a no-magic 40-kilometer march!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It sounded like there was a shriek from somewhere, but I must have heard wrong. Even if I was wrong, there was nothing we could do now. This military item had already been stained with black ink.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Hahaha! Feels good! It's like walking in the snow that no one stepped in yet!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For your information, a march in the Empire was with full gear. This was probably true considering the assistant teacher at the training center said so when he taught us how to pack military equipment in the comprehensive weaponry class.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I quickly copied the path of the director’s movements from today and drew a perimeter with a 500-meter radius around it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahhhhh! No!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After creating the perimeter, I left behind the very frustrated burden and confirmed the list of people who could handle the horn. The perimeter was the area that they could probably move with the horn.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;The length of time that the special magic treatment could be maintained was not long. As such, it would not be feasible in terms of time to transport the horn after processing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Horn was especially toxic, so unless it were an alchemist at elder Mirpa’s level or someone able to move at the speed of a battle race, it would be impossible. As for the time problem, carriages wouldn’t be able to help, as the capital’s roads were not asphalt but bumpy stone roads.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If the magic placed on the horn was released due to the carriage's shaking, the toxicity could become even worse. The toxicity sealing special treatment did not allow for the reagent bottle to be shaken.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Let's see. Twenty out of thirty-six were members of the imperial court magicians and lived in the outer palace. Two went missing a long time ago and were considered dead. For four of them, it had been a while since they left the capital to get some materials for magic potions. Seven of the remaining ten were too far, so the suspects were narrowed down to three.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>If I knew when Director&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had eaten the poison, I could pick one right away, but unfortunately, I didn't have his vomit to find out. I was able to rummage around it, but without a detailed component analysis, it was an impossible task even for me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was unfortunate, but even if I did have it, in the time it would take to complete the component analysis, I could have gone to the magic workshop of the three suspects and made a ruckus to find the culprit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I gave the burden a map with the identities and locations of the three suspects marked on it. The burden was frustrated once again when he saw the scribbled map.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hey, there's no time to be frustrated. We have to hurry and beat it, hmm! Let’s go now to arrest the criminal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In regards to military supplies, they were things that would pop up out of nowhere even if you cut off the supply. For him to be tearing up from this even after becoming a vice-captain, this man’s weak-heartedness had no equal.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Keup</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! The captain said he'd kill me if I messed up one more military supply item!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oh, it was indeed worthy of being frustrated. The captain did seem like a person who would be scary when he got angry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smiled nicely and kindly extended my hand to the burden, "Just think of it as nothing out of the ordinary."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the old saying goes, it's more convenient to give up. This wouldn't have happened if he didn't make fun of my map in the first place. Thanks to him, however, I didn’t have to compare the map in my head with the one I drew, which made it much more convenient for me. So let's thank him for that point, at least.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden didn’t take my kindly offered hand and rather looked to be in more despair. Looking at the burden, I had a thought: Truly a burden.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Get up, hero!" Remembering the strength control I trained by grabbing Alphonso’s head; I lightly kicked the burden’s butt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Ack</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was finally convinced when I saw the burden holding onto his butt. I had mastered strength control! He didn’t die, and I didn’t feel any bones break. I just had the feeling that I hit him very well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Come on! Let's go!" I snorted as I pulled the burden by the scruff of his neck.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Let's hurry up and torture the suspects!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I kicked down the door of the alchemy workshop, which also served as the residence of the first suspect, and shouted, "Get over here!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Kwang</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps due to the impact of the kick, the door easily broke apart and flew away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The door’s open, so let's go in,” I said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hey, they don't usually say it’s open for situations like this."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ignoring the crybaby burden who was still rubbing his butt, I went into the alchemy workshop. As I entered the house, I saw a man who seemed to be the owner urgently running out of the house.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What, what is this?" The man panicked as he looked back and forth at the broken door and us before pointing his finger at the burden next to me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What are you doing! How can you just go around breaking doors!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly being pointed at, the burden looked at me tearily. Rather than someone who was thin and innocent looking like me, the gangster-like burly burden was certainly more suspicious-looking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I said with a nod, "That’s right! Breaking the door all of a sudden is too much!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No! You...!” The burden choked on his own words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smiled at the burden and approached the man who seemed to be the owner of the house. "Let’s see, are you Mr. Capol?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, I'm Capol. But..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I presented a badge made from a steel plate that bore the insignia of the White Deer knights to the flustered first suspect. "This is where we’re from."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This badge, which was something like a police badge, belonged to the burden behind me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Huh? Huh?!" When I took out the badge, he panicked and searched his pocket, but no matter how much he looked for it, it would never show up. After all, his badge was currently in my hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I returned his military supply map, I sneaked his badge from his pocket. Seeing that he was unable to notice it until now, I was unsure whether the capital would be safe or not with such dull knights.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What brings you here from the White Deer knight division?" The alchemist looked at us with rather wary eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There have been reports that you and your workshop have been producing and distributing drugs. As long as you cooperate with the search, there will be no bloodshed,” I said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first suspect and the burden both looked at me in shock. I understood the alchemist’s feelings, but honestly, things were too complicated to explain. To have to explain the situation and wait for consent to begin searching would take too much time, and frankly, it was annoying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What nonsense! My workshop is clean and innocent!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I patted the shoulder of the first suspect, who was shouting with a bluish face. "That'll be confirmed after we see inside. Let's go search, vice-captain!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden looked at me as if the situation was absurd and whispered, "Hey, do you even know how a drug offender is treated with the way you're threatening him?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Of course I know. At the training center, I was number one in grades for imperial law. A first offense is at least ten years in prison or capital punishment. A second offense is at least 30 years or capital punishment."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For your information, this law was only for nobility. For commoners, it was just capital punishment, whether first time or second. The Empire was an absolute monarchy, so the laws for the common people and nobility were different. As an uncommon offense, all drug offenders were punished equally, except for nobility with a lot of power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In other words, to rebel here meant to be marked as a drug offender and be sent to the guillotine. As in most pre-modern countries, trials often took place with the presumption of guilt rather than the presumption of innocence.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Come to think of it; I'm really glad I saved the director.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If Pelgrant simply died, I would not have been able to find the criminal myself and would have had to try to prove my innocence while in custody. The alternative would have been to throw away my position as a civil servant trainee and run away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I have to do at least this much for him to cooperate easily.” I smiled brightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden had a rather tired face, but unless this suspect was the person I was looking for, things would be fine. Drugs wouldn’t actually turn up during the search, right?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I went into the workshop and observed the interior. In the middle of the room, there was a large pot, and next to the pot was a desk with magic reagents on it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let’s see." With just a rough look, I was able to see that there were magic reagents needed to magically treat the horn and some others that were not.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stood on my tiptoes and looked inside the pot. It was empty, but there was a smell left inside. I focused my mind on the scent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Moonlight plant, Moon Toad's essence, Aindra grass, sixth petal of the Mandrago flower...”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I recited the herbs just from the pot’s smell, the owner of the workshop looked at me in surprise. Being able to distinguish this much was only natural after being trained by elder Mirpa.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"...the blood of hell dogs, hmm, don't know, don’t know, fairy powder, don't know...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The herbs that I didn't know were odorless in the first place, or three days had already passed, allowing the smell to mostly dissipate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In order to temporarily seal the poison of the horn, the digestive fluid of the Giant&nbsp;</span><span>Nepenthes</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and the blood of an ice troll were essential. However, the workshop did not have the smell of either of these materials.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if they were placed in a safe or a secret place and sealed with magic, there was no way there wouldn’t be a smell if they had done the special treatment on the horn today.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unfortunately, the first suspect was not the criminal. Just in case, I decided to open the little space that was being magically protected underneath. The magic was placed on it so poorly that it may as well have been saying, “Here I am.” In that case, it would have been impolite not to take a look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Vice-captain, sir. Can you push this pot for me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Just do what I say. Didn’t you follow me to do the physical work?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I'm keeping watch..."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ssseup!" I opened my eyes wide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The burden touched the pot and muttered, "Why me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The owner of the workshop immediately panicked and stopped the burden, "Excuse me! The location of the pot has a fairly important and magical meaning-"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"There isn't. You can push it as it is." I cut off&nbsp;</span><span>Capol</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and urged the burden to push quickly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Who are you trying to cheat? After the burden pushed aside the large pot, a small door was found underneath.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let’s open it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I grabbed an iron skewer on the floor nearby and poked it into the crack in the door. I wiggled the skewer around to break the crystal that was the core for the magic. To think that this magic would be broken by an iron skewer... This was another level of poor quality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The door naturally lifted up when the magic was broken and revealed inside was paradise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"...your tastes are bold."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The various pornography books inside seemed interesting enough to even tempt me into reading them once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The owner of the workshop’s face became red as he shouted, "Get...! Get out now!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>That's how the burden and I were kicked out of the workshop. I wanted to try reading the books. That’s too bad.</span></p>
