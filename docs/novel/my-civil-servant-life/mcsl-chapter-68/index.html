 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You bastard! Flying away like a coward!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The masked people I had met on the roof could use magic well, but it seemed like these guys couldn’t?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I once read in a book that magic based on divine power was separated into classes and flying was forbidden depending on the religious class. If I remember correctly, it was probably because the sky was God's territory and only the class chosen by God could fly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Did it say that flying magic is possible from bishop-level or higher?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">So then they won’t be able to chase me if I fly away like this?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Good bye, everyone! I'm ridding myself of the fetters and shackles of this world and am leaving to find happiness. I wish you all happiness!” I soared higher as I cheerily greeted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You bastard!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The indignant masked group threw sword auras in retaliation. But it was all blocked by my shield, never reaching me. The farther the sword aura from the sword, the weaker it was. So, it was only natural.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"And this is my last gift!&nbsp;</span><span>Justice is pouring from the sky!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Circulating the magic circuit at full power, I shot thousands of magic bullets at the masked people. The rising dust obscured the masked people, but regardless of whether they were hit or not, I continued to rain magic bullets. When I was slowly running out of mana and got tired, a bolt of white lightning suddenly came towards me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">Kulok!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the powerful magic hit my shield, I felt a large chunk of my mana being shaved off. Of course, I stopped shooting the magic bullets and looked around to find the source of this magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">An old man in a golden mask was flying over.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Is he with the masked people?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who the heck are you!" The old man in the golden mask shouted at me and continued to attack without waiting for an answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Nevermind! Just die!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the old man in the golden mask waved his ceremonial-looking staff, hundreds of magic bullets shot towards me. I cut off the mana that I was supplying to the sleeping magic on the princess and executed an emergency evasive maneuver.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the high-speed maneuver, the magic bullets barely missed my body, but the princess moaned in her sleep.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hmm—"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Dammit, I’ll have to see after I survive if I can wake you up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wind maiden!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wind awls quickly surrounded the old man in the golden mask like an iron maiden.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hnng! God's iron mace!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man in the golden mask conjured a sphere of light, struck out a part of the wind's awl to create a gap and escape.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Divine punishment!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">White lightning flew out of my hands towards the old man in the golden mask.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You are a fool! Do you think you can hurt me with false light!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man's beckoning deprived me of the white lightning’s control, and the lightning flew back towards me. I was just going to use this magic to provoke him, but it was definitely better to not use magic that I had ridiculously copied.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My opponent knew this magic a lot better than I did, and I only mimicked it after a side glance. So, it was natural to lose control of it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Delete!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Easily erasing the white lightning, I cast another spell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Minefield!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man wearing a golden mask seemed to be preparing for my magic, he laughed at me when nothing happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hahaha! Did the magic fail? What a fool!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He raised his ceremonial-looking staff at me and flew towards me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kwang! Kwakwakwakwang-!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man in the golden mask was rushing at me when he touched a transparent magic mine I had laid in the air. As a result, due to being stunned or having fainted, he crashed down. However, he did not seem to have suffered major injuries so he probably had a magic shield up to cushion his fall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Personally, I was reluctant to kill people. But with my future in mind, it was better to end it here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My intuition was murmuring that this old man would bother me in the future. And if he were to disappear, that masked lot wouldn’t be able to stand again. There was no basis for it, but it was better not to spare potential future trouble.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Let's completely crush their psychology, so that even if we were to meet again in the future, they wouldn’t dare to be hostile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"That’s one trajectory."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn't like this magic because the incantation was cheesy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The ends of the seven spearheads fix the future."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was the best magic for the current situation, so I couldn't help it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What occurs is from a single result."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was magic that belonged to the great magic category, so my low mana was even further sucked out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ah, ahh, mana depletion was making me dizzy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Shortened incantation! Gae Bulg!"<span id="footnote-ref-7174"><a href="#footnote-7174">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A red flash of light came from my hand. It cut across the sky with a gleam of avarice as it shot towards the old man in the golden mask.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the dust settled, a masked man sprang from the ground. But it was too late. Even if he blocked it, that old man would die unless there was a miracle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, a white light barged in between the old man in the golden mask and the red light to block it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Paladin Vibrio, the masked person called Fox, was chasing after Bloody and William. She saw Leo, Cardo Fernando, and someone, engaged in a battle of magic in the distance. Sensing something strange, she wondered why Leo was suddenly in a battle of magic in the air.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Perhaps, is the opponent in that magic battle the source of the strange feeling she felt from the direction of the Magic School?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio was not certain but assumed that that man was indeed the source.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Then where were Paladin Mario and his subordinates who were supposed to be initiating the revolt?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Sh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">e spotted the Leopards led by Paladin Malive, just below the place where the magic war was unfolding. She felt momentary anxiety winding all over her body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">There was no way he got done in by that guy who seemed to be the main culprit, right?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">No, there was no way.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Vibrio braced her heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio regretfully, but objectively, judged that the Eagles led by Mario were stronger than the Foxes she helmed. But even the Foxes had succeeded in tying the feet of the Crow, Bloody and the Butterfly, William.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Although as a knight, she was a bit ashamed at achieving such a feat through long-range weapons instead of a close combat battle, she couldn't help it. In swordsmanship, they were no match for Bloody. Also, she and her knights were not as skilled at hiding&nbsp;</span><span>magical traits of divine power</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;like Fernando.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">No, Fernando, who could easily hide the characteristics of holy magic in front of a Butterfly, was a ridiculous&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">sham</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Fox!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A voice called Vibrio from behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Eagle!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was Mario. Vibrio could tell even though he was wearing a mask.&nbsp;</span><span>As&nbsp;</span><span>she</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>thought, there was no way Mario would have been done in</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but then she couldn't help but freeze when she looked at Mario again. His right arm that should have been attached to him was missing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wha-what happened!" Vibrio cried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mario turned his gaze towards Bloody and William. "Later. We are on a mission right now."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio gritted her teeth and continued to chase after Bloody and William.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Bloody! I sense Arelia is in the air. What’s going on?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At William's cries of confusion, other than Bloody, Mario and Vibrio also looked skyward.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That-that’s!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For some reason, Vibrio couldn't recognize it until just now. The princess was lying on the back of a man wearing a half-white mask and a suit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio was astonished at the reason her superior was engaged in a battle of magic, and at the same time understood. But on the other hand, she started doubting her own conjectures.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Man? Did I think he was a man just now?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was strange. She couldn’t clearly recognize it. He was definitely right there, but she couldn’t recognize him. This unfamiliar feeling seemed familiar to Vibrio.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The engrossed Vibrio was suddenly struck by a realization.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Half-white mask! Lupin!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Before she could voice her realization,&nbsp;</span><span>Fernando was already falling due to an unknown explosion in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">You have to catch him!&nbsp;</span><span>Vibrio thought as she binned the order to stall Bloody and William, and ran at full speed. While keeping her eyes on the falling Fernando, Vibrio noticed a chaotic red light in Lupin's hand. Then, the ferocious red light</span><span>&nbsp;turned into a beam&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">and flew at Fernando.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malive was watching the scene as well. He jumped dozens of meters, but it wasn’t enough to stop the red flash.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">No, no, no!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio grasped the rosary around her neck and yelled a prayer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"God! Merciful God! Please save him! I don't mind being a shield!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if Vibrio's prayers had been heard, a flash of white light burst out of the rosary. The brilliant white light was the light of a miracle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Vibrio made a wish for a miracle, Mario had grabbed Vibrio's hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Mario?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don’t want you to get hurt. I'll come back to pay you back for this sin."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After saying that, he hit Vibrio in the stomach and knocked her unconscious. The white light moved him between the red flash of light and Fernando.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ma...rio?" Fernando called out as his senses returned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I will protect you," Mario said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"These… foo...lish."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Because of the golden mask, he couldn’t see Fernando’s face; but Mario had served him for a long time and could tell. He was sure that under the mask, Fernando wore an expression of sharp disapproval</span><span>.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;No matter how hard he tried to block it, he realized that if hit, he would at best land up in a critical condition.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Please don't reprimand Paladin Malive too much. He tried his best."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mario didn't even check whether Fernando was listening or not. It was nothing more than self-consolation. Despite the red flash seemingly approaching slowly, being able to have a short conversation, was one of the little miracles bestowed by the white light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But even that miracle was running out of time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mario cemented his determination, boosted his magic power as much as possible, and blocked the red flash of light. But the red flash still passed through the defensive magic he had put up with all his might and penetrated Fernando's heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No!!!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mario shouted a prayer in a voice full of despair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"God!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The sacred-looking white light was blinding. It had emerged from the arm of the masked person. It was a waste of time.&nbsp;</span><span>My magic was already flying towards its target — the old man in the golden mask.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I indifferently watched the red light’s trajectory pass through the heart of the old man wearing the golden mask. The magic seemed to successfully crush his heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But at that moment, the white light seemed to blindingly explode encompassing the entire area. I closed my eyes for a second. When I opened my eyes, the one plummeting with blood spurting out of his chest was a masked person who had blocked the red flash of light. The old man was falling with blood pouring out from his left abdomen, not his heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">What happened?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;I was sure the magic had been successful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Did it fail because I shortened the incantation? It couldn't be.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If magic had failed by omitting incantations, all the magic I'd ever used in my life should have failed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Was it related to the white light? I don't know.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I took out a MP potion, or officially called, mana recovery potion, from my pocket space and drank it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span>Keuh</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, gross!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Why were there no artificial flavoring agents in this world! I wasn’t expecting flavors like cola, but it would have been nice if there were at least fruity flavors. Anyway, it didn't matter if the magic failed or not. It’d be over once I used the magic again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I waited for my mana to fill up again. The masked people on the ground caught the still warm body of the one whose heart was crushed in place of the golden masked old man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Retreat!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man, my original target, was in such bad condition that he poured out healing magic while shouting in an urgent voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I reached my palm out to the hastily fleeing masked group. I aimed at the poor golden masked old man who was being carried princess style, even though he wasn’t a princess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Huh?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mana recovery potion that I drank was gross, but had an excessively fast recovery rate that put a strain even on my body. But even after that, I still had no mana. Realistically, it wasn’t like a MP potion in a game that instantly filled up your mana tank, but mana should gather at least somewhat by now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, my mana had not recovered even at the level of natural recovery. It was as if something around me was blocking the connection between me and the surrounding mana.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It felt as if there was something that made my lethal move miss, kept that old man from dying, and prevented my mana recovery.</span></p>
