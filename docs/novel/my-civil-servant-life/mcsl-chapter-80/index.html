 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">By early evening, it was already getting dim as daylight had shortened. It seemed that winter had arrived. The good thing was that they let me go home on time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Come on, cheer up. I'll buy the drinks today."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I sighed and thanked Flam.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flam’s director laughed it off with a ‘hahaha’ when Flam made mistakes, but mine was like a knife. No, rather, he seemed like a man who was dissatisfied because he couldn't push me around. I wondered if I had an enemy in my previous life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, I did a lot of this and that as I lived in my previous life. Since there were so many potential candidates that I could point at, let’s just move on.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I think on the last day of training, I should have a face-to-face meeting with the overbearing director. That way, he can reflect on his past and say that he will be born as a flea in his next life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">We went into a nearby bar that seemed decent enough.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Did the&nbsp;</span><span>dormitory</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;rules say that you were allowed to drink?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As far as I knew, the dormitory housemaster was very strict.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hahaha, it's all right. Yesterday, he announced that we were allowed to drink, but also said we had to come back sane."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It seemed the housemaster was becoming a little more lenient because the training was reaching its&nbsp;</span><span>end</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's good. Oh, two lagers and a plate of sausages, please.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After I ordered, two frighteningly large glasses of beer were served. The snacks had yet to arrive, even so, I took a swig of the beer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Keeuuu</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That director was definitely crazy. How could one give a newbie a pile of receipts, a bunch of paper, and an abacus and tell him some crap like make a year-end settlement?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn’t know how old the pile of receipts was, but they weren’t even organized, so I had to start by organizing them. If I hadn't made an excel sheet on the spot with magic while organizing the receipts, I would have been still touching the abacus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But actually, I was not entirely sure if it was accurate because I had made it from just the accounting ledger books and didn’t double-check the bank records. I wasn’t even in a position to check it anyways. Still, I calculated all the receipts I was given. Just in case a different bank record showed up later, I left enough blank space so I could change it. So I was sure I would be able to work something out later.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After encountering Director&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, he seemed to want to give me a failing grade, so it looked like I had handled it as perfectly as possible. He would likely give me a mid-range score even if he didn't want to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The glass of beer was empty before I knew it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"One more drink!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aren’t you drinking too fast?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flam worried, but the Crows also had stomachs of steel!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Sitting next to Arcanta,&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;sighed as he was given a glass of beer by the prime minister.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span>Didn’t I request many times not to send me a trainee</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, I send trainees to all the district department directors, so I can't just not send you one, can I?" Arcanta laughed and took a sip of his drink.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However,&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;only looked at Arcanta with a stiff face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta wiped the smile from his face and put down his glass. "You still haven't been able to forget the old days?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;bowed his head as if he was ashamed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm sorry."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's already been four years, no, almost 5 years since the trainee under you got caught up in your work and died. I won't tell you to forget. But it's all over. If you've done that much atonement already, you should stop and be comfortable."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;frowned and shook his head. "If I can’t forget and keep it in my mind, I don't know about anyone else, but it’s still the present for me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Arcanta impolitely looked at&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant's</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;frown. Pelgrant's forehead had deep wrinkles that resembled a frown even though he wasn't actually frowning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He knew&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant's</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;wrinkled forehead was a direct result of his agony and atonement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is that why you still harass the trainees when they arrive? So they don't come near you?" Arcanta said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span>&nbsp;smiled bitterly. Looking back on his behavior, it may have been a trauma-induced obsessive-compulsive disorder. That the trainee&nbsp;</span><span>might have died&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">because he had gotten close to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, I'm sorry about the trainee, but I unconsciously keep thinking of things to scold about.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Arcanta smiled lightly and jested. "Yes, how many hours did this trainee last? If he&nbsp;</span><span>managed</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to last for about three hours, I'll have to scout him over to the Treasury.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"The Treasury that’s being ground up by&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;person? Would three hours be enough? Don’t you think he would have to last at least three days?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hahaha, is that so?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, in that sense, this trainee might be deserving to get scouted."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Arcanta was surprised by&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. This director was so meticulous and strict with people that it must have been a person of considerable talent for him to say so.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who is it for you to say that?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"He said his name was... Den," Pelgrant said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Arcanta thought to himself, 'No way.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">'</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Come to think of it, he had heard a report that the student named Den living at his mother, Arscilla’s, boarding house had passed the civil service exam and was now a trainee.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If you're interested, would you like for me to investigate and include it on the next report?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Arcanta shook his head at&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, a personal investigation isn’t necessary. Aren't you busy too? I'll just check the training evaluation you give him later."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ok, I understand."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;gulped down his drink and brought out an envelope from his bag.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This is a document regarding the investigation of ‘Scorpio’."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm forever sorry about this."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>As Arcanta bowed his head,&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;felt awkward and waved his hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, it’s ok. They are my enemies too."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta immediately checked the documents in the envelope. It tracked one person's past movements.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This person," Arcanta said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's an informant I barely managed to find."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The bowl is too small for this person to be called 'Scorpio’s' informant”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The director nodded his head. He totally agreed with the prime minister.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta was lost in thought as he checked the documents. "It could be bait.” If he touched it hastily, it could become more dangerous.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;understood Arcanta's meaning and smiled bitterly. “But it's also the only clue.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You could die.” Arcanta warned</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;rose from his seat and said with a bitter smile, "Then my present will be over."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta was saddened by his words. He should have shouldered all the sins, but the fact he couldn't felt so cruel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then excuse me first."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The tavern became very quiet when&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;bowed out. Arcanta held his glass heavily in a space full of silence. The sound of the ice in the glass clinking sounded sad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I woke up in the morning and grabbed my head as it felt like it was going to shatter. This hangover was no joke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Water."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Making water by magic, I drank the floating water from the air. Then I got out of bed, opened the window, and cast magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oxygen Agglomeration."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oxygen gathered around me according to my mana and the other molecules were pushed out. This magic was from a magic book borrowed from Yuria and was touted as the must-have magic of the Butterfly Tribe people living in the highlands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hoo-ha, hoo-ha!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>As I temporarily breathed in the high concentration of oxygen around me, I felt like my headache fading away. I didn't know if it was because alcohol&nbsp;</span><span>interfered</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;with oxygen going to the brain, but it worked. Considering that I drank last night, could it just be a placebo effect?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What was more shocking was that the Crows’ stomachs were not made of steel. I don’t even know if I threw up a few times on my way back to the boarding house yesterday. I only drank 30 glasses of beer half mixed with liquor, but this scene was a disgrace to the Crows!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I'm so ashamed that I don’t think I can reveal that I'm a Crow now. Oh, I never revealed it before to begin with.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Struggling with a hangover, I went down to the first floor while thinking about this and that.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, did you wake up?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As usual, Lisbon greeted me in the morning. Considering that it was about 6:40 now, when did that pushover wake up?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike his usual soft and smooth-looking self, his clothes were wet with sweat. He seemed to have exercised early in the morning.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he came to the capital, I don’t think he woke up this early. But he seemed to be concerned about training after obtaining a goal since entering the knight school. His goal was to join the Black Water Buffalo Knight Division led by Uncle Bloody.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I couldn’t understand him. It seems he had heard some good things during the entrance exam.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aren't you cold?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was winter now. It was still dark outside, and the coldest time of the day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hmm? Ah. I’m all right. But rather, it’s a little hot?" &nbsp;Lisbon shrugged.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, come to think of it, what you said yesterday wasn’t sincere, was it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What did I say yesterday? Ah!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"You came, Pushover?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Yes, that! What&nbsp;</span><span>do you</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>mean by a pushover</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">? You said that because you were drunk, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lisbon looked at me with a rare sulky face. I naturally nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There are things called drunken truths in this world.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lisbon looked shocked as if he had been betrayed. "So mean! How could you call me a pushover too? Since Aly heard that last night, she says that every time she sees me!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I laughed at Lisbon who was on the verge of tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hahaha, that's understandable for Alice. It was because of you that you guys were so strapped for money when coming to the capital."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's true. But it’s still too much!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pushover ran towards the shower with a tearful look. If it were Pushover, he would forget everything after work today anyways. Would a person be called a pushover for nothing?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I went into the kitchen and tried to find something to eat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, did you sleep well?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>There was a worker in the kitchen hired by Mrs.&nbsp;</span><span>Arscilla</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is there perhaps something to eat?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As I grabbed my stomach, she laughed and took an apple out of the refrigerator.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Please wait a little bit. I'll cut it for you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mrs. Arscilla took the apple from the worker as she spoke.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This will be fine for my breakfast. I think I'll have to go a little early today."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"You drank that much, but do you think that will be enough to handle it?” said Mrs.&nbsp;</span><span>Arscilla</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;as she blocked the girl trying to take something more out of the refrigerator.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you for your concern, but I have a strong body. Thank you for the apple, Miss Plina."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I think her name was Plina. Judging from her surprised reaction when I said the name, I must have been right.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I ate the apple as I got ready for work. For a fruit that was a little out of season, it was very fresh and delicious.</span></p>
