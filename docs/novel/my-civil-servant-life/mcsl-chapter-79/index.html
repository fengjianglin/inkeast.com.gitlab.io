 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Come to think of it, it would be my big sister's birthday soon. I sent her Goddess’s Blessing. I hope she received it well.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Originally, I was going to send it as a necklace or make it into some other jewelry, but it was too famous of a stone for me to leave it to a craftsman. However, I was worried about ruining such a precious stone if I tried myself, so I just sent it as is. Unlike me, the village’s master craftsman was good with his hands, so I reckon he would be able to make it into something.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I entered the district office, a warm breeze blew out towards me. Looking at the flow of mana, there seemed to be a magic fan inside the building.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, it's warm inside."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flam also felt the warm wind and his face relaxed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The inside is cleaner than I thought."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was much cleaner than the office I saw when I went to report the transfer in the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm in the third department. Where are you, Flam?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, I am in the fourth department."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The district office had a total of five departments, and each department received one trainee. If it were other training sessions to be held later on, it would be with many others like taking a class. But there were dozens of district offices in the capital, so individual training was possible. As Flam and I were at the top of the list, we were assigned to the district office, the lower ranks had been assigned to a local town office.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For your information, I visited a local town office once to report my transfer, but it was not a good environment. It was my first time coming to the district office. But the fact that the district office had a heater running because it was winter, the difference in work environment between the district and local town office was very clear. The building of the district office was so neat and nice that it made me want to just slightly raise my grades to get into the district office.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flam and I went up to the second floor to go to the department we were assigned to. As soon as we went up, we noticed a banner saying, "Selected as the best district office by the imperial family”. There was also a small phrase below, "Thank you very much for your hard work”.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I almost burst into laughter at the banner that really seemed appropriate hanging in a national institution. It seems every world has this kind of thing hanging up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When it came to the level of a district office, it seemed things were managed by the imperial family.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I am over here," Flam said, pointing to where it said Fourth Department.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Let me see.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm over there."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Right next to where it said Fourth Department, it said Third Department.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"See you later, then. A drink later?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flam made a drinking gesture in front of the entrance door and I nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Sounds good to me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a little too noisy to drink alone in the boarding house. But to drink together... Mrs. Arscilla was the only one who drank, besides me. However, she preferred wine and that too the high-end ones that it didn’t really suit me. Considering my tastes were cheap lager beer made from barley and a lot of other grains, I couldn’t really make any recommendations either.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I entered the door marked Third Department.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Huh?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I could see a wide-open space, not a small room. There was a group of desks under a wooden board hanging from the ceiling that said, "The Fourth Department" right next to the place where there was a wooden board that said, "The Third Department".</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>And when I turned my head, Flam and my eyes met.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">If it was going to be like this, why did you make two doors?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flam and I smiled embarrassedly and approached the desk with the nameplate "Department Director”.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the desk, a stern-looking, skinny, middle-aged bespectacled man in his 40s was sitting and perusing the documents. His neat black-brown hair, which was split 2:8, and the creases in the middle of the forehead made him look strict.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Third Department Director&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;von Bologneo. Confirming the name on the plaque, I bowed and greeted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hello! I am a trainee assigned as a probationary worker, Den von Mark! I look forward to working with you for the next week!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Good. A 60-degree lower-back angle with a strong voice that was neither too loud nor too small and sounded polite; both hands politely hovering over the belly button. This was a perfect score for the first greeting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Glancing over, Flam was greeting like he was greeting a brother with his arms slightly spread out in a loud voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Oh, my!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;I was a little worried about Flam, but the director smiled kindly and received Flam's greeting. I bowed my head and greeted, but the director who received my greeting didn’t respond.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I slightly looked up at the director's face, but he bluntly looked down at me with a face full of dissatisfaction.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You... What time is it right now?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the rather grumpy voice, I answered while slowly straightening my back. "Yes! It's 7:50!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why did you come so late!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What kind of nonsense is he spouting?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I definitely received an official document telling me to come by 8:30. So I aimed to arrive by 8 a.m., 30 minutes prior to the appointed time but still arrived 10 minutes earlier because of my strong legs.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">But what? Late? I am?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If it's your first time, you should have been here by 7:30!" the director hollered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I bowed my head again. "I’m sorry!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">How unlucky!&nbsp;</span><span>It was not the time for me to worry about others.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;Damn it, how could I get this unlucky!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It wasn't a matter of my behavior, but rather that person. Suddenly, I became envious of Flam.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Was it too late to swap now?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is it over if you’re sorry!?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the roar, I just stared at the director’s necktie pin and not his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At times like this, if you looked down at the floor, you would get yelled at for looking elsewhere, but if you looked at him, you would get yelled at for being audacious. You had to look at a place where he couldn’t get angry at you properly, bob your head, and acknowledge that you were listening to the nagging.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, it is not."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Tsk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, this is why kids these days won’t work out."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I wanted to hit the director clicking his tongue with all my might, but this man would be the one scoring me. No, before that, if I hit him with all my might, he'd die. I wasn’t such a bad guy as to kill a man for this kind of thing. Of course, of course. Let's be moderate and spit in his tea instead.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I stood still and waited for the nagging, the man shouted angrily, "Go!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I can’t get sullen here. It was still not enough to judge what kind of person the director was, but there were cases where they would get scolded more if t</span><span>hey&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">were too sullen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I backed away carefully, a chubby man who seemed to be from the same department approached me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahhaha, ha. You said Mr. Den, right? You can sit here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The seat he pointed to with an awkward smile was closest to the director.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I gave a look of, “are there no seats farther away”, he quietly whispered, "This is the trainee's seat."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since the director was the evaluator, it seemed that trainees were assigned where he could easily keep his eyes on them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Cheer up!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The chubby man looked at me with sorry eyes and went back to his seat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Judging from that reaction, the Director seemed to be of that personality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Dammit. I’m f**ked!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Around evening&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;got up from his seat to get ready to leave work.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then the new trainee seated closest to him stopped what he was doing and stood up to greet him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you leaving work now, Director!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span>&nbsp;recalled the name of the trainee.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Did he say his name was Den? It’s nice to see him working hard and brimming with laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you stopping now after you’ve finished your work?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Unlike his innermost thoughts,&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;pretended to be overbearing and glared at the new trainee.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes! Everything you asked me to do is done."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was surprised by the trainee. What he had ordered Den to do couldn't be completed all in one day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Let me see."&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;sincerely narrowed his brows and reached his hand out to the trainee.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he had done a half-ass job because he wanted to leave early, he would have to actually scold him sincerely, rather than getting just a little upset.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Here you are."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Den handed&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a thick pile of papers, the latter quickly examined the pile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What Pelgrant’d asked the trainee to do was to arrange the accounts for the year-end settlement. It wasn’t a task he had assigned with the intent of seeing its completion. It was just arranging many accounts for the year-end settlement.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It was a job that&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span>&nbsp;didn't even ask new recruits to do. It was a job he had assigned the new trainee, Den, along with a single abacus so that when Den came crying saying he couldn’t do it, he would be able to remove Den from the task and keep Den away from&nbsp;</span><span>approaching him in the future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, at a glance, the accounting seemed perfect. To be sure, he would need to double-check all the receipts they had and the bank accounts, but it roughly matched the one from his memory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"And here are the receipts and authorization documents in chronological order."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span>&nbsp;was frightened.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What is this guy?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had gone to the market in the morning to get tea and snacks for the department staff, helped them move heavy items, and ran errands for them, but still had time to finish his work?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What kind of monster was this?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The number of receipts and documents for authorization was so high that even he wouldn’t be able to complete it after working all day. He wondered if the trainee got help from the other department staff, but this trainee with innocent eyes had been under his watch since the morning. He had thought the guy had given up since he hadn't even touched the abacus, but it seems he just did the math in his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Should he scold him here?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pelgrant’s conscience wouldn't allow him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hmm! Everybody can leave work."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;threw the accounting papers onto his desk and left. From behind rose the joyful cries of the department staff.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The director smiled and quickly left the district office. He checked his watch as he hurried through the streets thinking time was a little tight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Standing in front of a closed tavern in the back alley,&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;let out a coarse breath and brought his civil service card to the door.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Beep!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When he heard the sound, a man of sturdy build came out of the tavern.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You are a little late."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You know it’s always busy at the end of the year. You're a civil servant too, so you should know."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man smiled at Pelgrant’s words. "I know. You’re killing me these days."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;smiled at the man’s bluntness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But still, didn't you get off work this early this time because of the work hours set by His Excellency?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thanks to you, the number of times I’ve gotten off this early can be counted on one hand."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>As&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and the man chatted, a voice came from inside the tavern.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What are you guys talking about over there? Come on in."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;went into the tavern. When the tavern door closed, it locked automatically with a clank.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;couldn't feel it, but he knew the inside of the tavern was protected by all sorts of magic. He took a step closer and bowed his head in greeting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's been a long time. Your Excellency, Prime Minister."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Arcanta smiled at&nbsp;</span><span>Pelgrant</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
