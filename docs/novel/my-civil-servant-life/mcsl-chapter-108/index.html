 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even so, none of the 12 Zodiacs could ignore Leo unless Fernando’s support base disappeared.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Didn’t Leo get seriously wounded because he was forced to fight in a confined space where the power of his group was suppressed?” Libra was trying to comprehend why Leo was still unable to recover from his injuries after falling for the prime minister’s delicious bait.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uududuk!" Vibrio gritted her teeth at Libra.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This reaction wasn’t only because he stabbed her weak spot; it also reminded her of how helpless she was at the time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So, why did you approach me, Libra?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Libra removed his index finger from his temple and opened his arms wide. "I’m just here to give you advice."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Advice?" Vibrio doubted Libra. She was wary and distrustful.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I say advice, but it’s not anything big. Just leave the Great Temple."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leaving the Great Temple wasn’t a big deal? What kind of nonsense was he spouting? She could not leave the Great Temple. She had so many precious colleagues, the cardinal who they respected more than anyone else, and the Great Cause they risked their lives to follow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All of this was at the Great Temple. Above all, she could not understand receiving such advice from Libra.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Vibrio just stared at Libra without saying anything, but Libra burst into a cheerful laugh. "</span><span>Puhahaha</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! You don't have to understand. I’m just telling you to look at the reality of the situation. What can you do while you’re at the Great Temple? Just sit helplessly in a room?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio exploded at Libra’s ridicule. "Shut up!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite Vibrio's cry, no one in the crowded plaza looked over at her. It appeared as if they were in an isolated space that she couldn’t recognize. Yet, Vibrio’s anger had gotten to her head, and in her rage, she didn't notice it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Libra was looking at Vibrio with eyes full of joy when he suddenly turned his gaze to the right. "Mmm, I guess that's it for our meeting."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Libra clicked his tongue like someone who was just disturbed and raised his cane. "I hope to see you again, Vibrio."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Libra placed his cane back on the ground, his body disappeared from sight. It was as if he was never there in the first place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What…."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite Vibrio's trained senses, she could not find any signs of Libra. If he had moved with teleportation magic, she should be able to sense the lingering mana, but even that couldn’t be felt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Unni!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio stared at the spot where Libra had been as if she were possessed by a ghost. She was interrupted when she heard a voice calling for her and she looked to the right. There, Hillis was approaching her as she pushed through the crowd while waving her hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hillis."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio stroked Hillis’s hair as Hillis went into her arms, and she looked at the fountain in the center of the plaza. The fountain’s water had been emptied to prevent it from freezing in the cold weather, and young children were running around it happily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She felt as if she had emerged from a black and white world into a colored world.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Vibrio fiddled with her left hand. There was still some water on it that had yet to dry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lancelot sighed as he grabbed his head. "</span><span style="font-style: italic">Ehew</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">~"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac and Leisha bowed their heads with ashamed faces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So when His Highness, the Crown Prince, asked you to build a bridge with Saintess-nim, you said yes without hesitation, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uh… that’s right," Leisha affirmed in a slightly dispirited voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lancelot's sigh deepened. "</span><span style="font-style: italic">Ha-ah</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">~ And so that’s why His Highness, the Crown Prince, is coming here now?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot looked up at the vast temple from the entrance of the building.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, that's correct.” This time, Mac answered while avoiding Lancelot’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps because he felt a little guilty, he wasn’t speaking to Lancelot in his usual manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot rubbed his face as he felt a headache come on. "Didn't military affairs ask you not to get involved with the Empire’s politics before you left?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha became flustered, "No, I didn't know it was political. Really!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That’s right. We didn't know.” Mac copied Leisha.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot suddenly burst into a fit of rage, "There's no way the Crown Prince of the Empire officially meeting someone is not political!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The raging Lancelot took a deep breath and quickly apologized, "I'm sorry I yelled. I should have explained it better before I left.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Lancelot blamed himself, Mac and Leisha spoke in panic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, it's all my fault!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right! It's all Miss’s fault!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha looked back and glared at Mac. Mac turned his head away to avoid Leisha’s gaze.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hmmhmm, anyway. Lancelot didn’t do anything wrong, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's right."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Actually, I still don't understand why this is political,” Mac said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot’s eyes looked like he had given up. If he explained it again, it would be the third time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"To explain in a way that’s easy to understand, the royal family and the temple are not on good terms. In comparison, it's a relationship between the guard dog in hell and the stone monkey in hell." (1)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In short, it was a mutual dislike.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Mmm, I understand&nbsp;</span><span>up to there</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.” Mac nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But at the same time, the royal family and the temple have a symbiotic relationship. The temple needs a safe fence called the Empire for the sake of the believers’ safety, and the imperial family needs the support of the faith for unified and stable governance of the Empire."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uh... I understand.” Mac’s face showed that he didn't understand at all.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He couldn't understand how two groups could want to kill one another and have a relationship of mutual dislike while simultaneously being in a symbiotic relationship. To explain the relationship between the royal family and the temple, it wouldn’t work unless the details of 200 years of Empire’s history were explained at the minimum.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For someone as ignorant of the Empire’s history as Mac, it was practically impossible for him to understand. At the same time, it would be going overboard to explain that much history in a short time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wanted to make him understand but couldn't. And so he stopped thinking about it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't give up!” Mac cried out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot smiled dejectedly while staring off at a distant mountain. "Huh-huh-huh. I wonder what I should report to the Military Leader...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac and Leisha became pale at Lancelot’s murmuring.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Plea, please, anyone but the Military Leader!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's right! There’s no need to go so far as to tell Unni!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as this news entered Hestia's ears, it was clear that Doomstone's iron fist sanctions would be imposed with a great deal of nagging.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Crow Tribe was extremely reluctant to be involved in the internal politics of other countries. This held true not only for the Crows but also for the Butterfly and Dragon Tribes. If the battle races interfered with other countries at any level, there was the risk that they might affect that country’s state of affairs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Let’s look at it in pieces. Suppose that the actions of the battle races led to countries implementing anti-battle race policies. If this occurred, the battle race tribes located in remote, difficult-to-reach areas would face considerable challenges in the supply and demand of materials from outside the tribe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, 500 years ago, there was a period when public opinion toward the battle race was extremely poor due to the war between the now-extinct Holy Tribe and Giant Tribe. As a result, most of the battle races lost trade deals with the outside world. Therefore, they had to be more cautious now.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, that didn't mean that Lancelot’s party would be reluctant to act. The Crows were also leaders in society, and as a village-level force, they possessed a strong power comparable to the Empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if they had difficulty trading with the outside world, it was not too hard to wage war for their compatriots as needed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Nevertheless, the reason for the battle race’s slightly excessive cautiousness was that they felt the need to continue communications with the outside world. Therefore, it was necessary to establish a stable and continuous relationship with friendly allies.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a result, each of the battle race tribes dispatched various talents as a token of their alliance for the sake of safe and stable trade. This was why Bloody, William, and Orphina were currently members of the imperial army.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just Bloody, William, and Orphina.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">These three left their tribes and were associated with the Empire, ensuring that they had some political activities within the Empire. At the same time, however, they could not receive protection from each of their respective tribes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, this lack of protection only extended in cases with clear and justifiable reasons, such as being killed or injured during war with other countries. For deaths with unclear reasons such as assassination and poisoning, thorough blood revenge had been carried out after investigating the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>For reference, in the past, there was a time when Doomstone running away from home had caused issues. The father of Doomstone and chief of the previous generation,&nbsp;</span><span>Zendia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Blade, had resolved the situation through active trade (and force).</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was a diplomatic strategy that used the Crow Tribe’s image of being simple and barbaric, as well as the Crow Tribe’s past achievements of defeating the Demon King Kanglim, to resolve the issue without any damage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In addition, there were battle races that were the exception and engaged in outside activities as the ruling class of a nation in place of building this type of alliance. This was the case for the now-extinct Holy Tribe and the Fairy Tribe currently located in the southern part of the continent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot sighed again at the sight of the fully grown adults clinging to him. "Still, it's a mistake we made, so we have to report it, but don't worry too much. This isn't that big of an intervention.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But! It’s scary!” As Leisha's eyes became moist and she trembled in fear, Lancelot patted Leisha's shoulders with eyes that seemed to have given up on everything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"As Den said, it's comfortable if you give up. Give up. Hahaha." Lancelot's dry laughter forced Mac and Leisha into despair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot still thought it was lucky to have a minor accident like this before they could cause a big one. At least now, they would be extra careful in fear of Doomstone’s iron fists.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, a familiar voice came from behind them. "Leisha? You came earlier than promised."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha turned around and found Hillis walking over, arm in arm with her sister Vibrio. Lancelot didn’t have to explain the situation once more, as he had sent a letter in advance to clarify what had happened and make an appointment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same time, a huge carriage with an imperial flag was approaching from far behind Hillis. The dice had already been thrown. Lancelot sighed at the fact that he was not the one who threw the dice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t his business whether the crown prince achieved his goal. He was just interested in finding Den.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Notes: 1) I believe Guard dog in hell is referring to Cerberus and the stone monkey is referring to the Monkey king who defied Hell’s attempt to collect his soul.</span></p>
