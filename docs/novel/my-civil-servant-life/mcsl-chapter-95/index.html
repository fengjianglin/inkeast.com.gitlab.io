 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Losing points on the first day went smoothly. The civil servant manager who conducted the training evaluation was so nice that I couldn’t do things to make him openly express his anger, so instead, I just made small mistakes during the easy parts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>For example, while moving an empty flask, I pretended my hands slipped and while turning around, I pretended to accidentally hit a precision magic tool with my elbow. Flam was next to the empty flask and barely managed to catch. For the precision magic tool, I&nbsp;</span><span>made sure to hit it, and at the same time, made sure that the tool was obviously not broken.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was not difficult for me for I had now mastered strength control. Even if it broke, it didn't matter because I could fix a magic tool of that level even with my eyes closed and that too with my toes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If I really ended up not being able to fix it, then well, I could always just pay for it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As I made a series of mistakes that I usually wouldn’t, Flam looked at me with strange eyes. But since the evaluator was ignorant, he hacked away at my score.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was my intention, after all, they couldn't award a good score to those that frequently made small mistakes in places such as a magic tower.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And today, at dawn, after the first day of training, I was sneaking into the Red Magic Tower. There was no particular reason. It was because of the precision magic tool I elbowed in the afternoon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Hmm, it wouldn’t be broken, right?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I stood in the dark magic tools storage room and looked at the precision magic tool I hit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>No matter how much I had mastered strength control,&nbsp;</span><span>the precision magic tool could be really delicate and I could have accidentally broken it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It's really not that I made a late-night visit because I wanted to rip it apart to view the inside of the precision magic tool.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Of course, of course</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, I was visiting just in case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if I was acting like this to get a low score, I wouldn't be causing actual damage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Huhuhu.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I hummed and carefully disassembled the body of the magic tool with a precision driver. As far as I knew, this precision magic tool was a tool for checking the genetic makeup before synthesizing a chimera.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Life magic, including chimeras, was not an area I specialized in, so I wasn’t sure. But in terms of chimera compatibility, there were entities that merged well or not, even if they were of the same species. In other words, this tool played a role in reducing the probability of failure in chimera creation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Ohh!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Inside the body was magic formulas that complicatedly entwined mana lines that connected mana.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Notes, notes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I brought out my pen and notebook from the pocket space and took notes on the magic formula inside the precision magic tool.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would have been nice to sketch along the arrangement of the mana lines, but it was too much for my drawing skills. So I just wrote down which parts had mana lines and my conjectures on why it was arranged in this way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The mana power is 320MV, the mana quantity is 500MP, and both are imperial standard. Given the size of the mana stone used, the mana stone is from an upper-middle rank monster. Based on the smell from the mana stone, is it from a Pilagrop? Judging from the faint smell, the mana stone was used for at least three months. Based on the remaining mana, it seems quite efficient."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I mumbled and jotted down the analysis to decipher the formula.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Pilagrop</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;was a two-headed monster with a long neck commonly found in the monster territory and in the outskirts of Olympus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Personally, I had named it "</span><span>Doduo</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">," but it looked more like a crawling reptile, rather than a bird, and it wasn't even that cute.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In fact, it looked rather gross. In short, besides being a common monster and being a commonly captured monster in my hometown for the coming-of-age ceremony, there was not much else about it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From my pocket space, I took out an insulating rod, a tool used in alchemy, and carefully moved the mana lines to see where I couldn’t before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Mmm Mmm, as expected. It's not broken.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After examining the inside of the magic tool, I reassembled it. If it was only this much, I think I could make it if I just had the materials.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, making the mana lines would need to be outsourced, but that wasn’t hard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">This accursed dexterity!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Come to think of it, how were the weaponsmiths in the Crow village so dextrous?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Well, considering I could also draw delicate magic formulas without much trouble, I wasn’t in a position to question them. Even the weaponsmiths in the hometown had terrible artistic sense other than in making weapons.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was trying to leave the magic tool storage room, but then I suddenly thought that this might be an opportunity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The opportunity to explore every corner of the magic tower...</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The magic tower pass I had was essentially a magic tool to help getting into places and avoid the protective magic surrounding the magic tower. Similar to the pass was the access cord needed to cross the sword line in the imperial palace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Compared to the access cord, this pass was child's play, and the range of entry was limited in</span><span>&nbsp;normal cases.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For example, if the magic tower's defense and protection magic circles were security servers, this pass was a terminal that could contact the security server. Normally, breaking through a security server and breaking into the magic tower would require three days of preparation even for me. However, if there was a terminal that could contact the magic circle like this, then the story was different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">What shall I do?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was conflicted as I took out and rubbed the half-white mask thinking about potential unknown situations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Should I quietly leave or see if there is any secret research nearby in the magic tower?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If it was the usual, I would have searched without hesitation, but the fact that it was the Red Magic Tower’s workshop made me hesitate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There wouldn’t be any danger in this magic tool storage room as it was accessible to civil servants as well. But the actual research facilities were different.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since it was a magician’s workshop, it was a basic principle that the inside would be designed to be able to deal with magicians a few levels higher than the owner. The better the skills of the workshop owner, the stronger magician.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I had never seen the Tower Master, but I didn't think his skills would be better than William’s. However, the owner of a Giant Tower would at least be a great magician, so it would be dangerous to recklessly roam about in a great magician’s workshop.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After thinking about it, I broke into a grin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Let's just do it and see what happens.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wouldn’t be hard to escape with just my body if I try my best. I mean, the worst thing that would happen would be the magic tower being destroyed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn't think I would be able to get appointed to the magic tower anyways, so it would be a waste to miss this opportunity.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, let's be careful not to cause any damage since it’d be a headache if I get caught.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Edward did not leave the chimera breeding facility until late at night and checked the chimera’s conditions. He paid particularly more attention to the chimeras requested by the Tower Master. T</span><span>he chimeras did not have a long lifespan, so they all required delicate care.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haaa~!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Edward yawned from exhaustion but did not stop writing in the daily log to record the status of the chimeras.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then a voice started to sparsely come from somewhere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let's play."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Surprised by the sudden sound of a voice, Edward looked around and soon found the owner of the voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Number 46A-10346. So it was you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Calming his startled heart, Edward sighed in relief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Edward Oppa.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a quite bizarre scene to see a dog-shaped chimera calling Edward, but Edward replied with a very happy face. "Yes, what shall we play?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even as he replied, he knew that the chimera didn't understand him. Furthermore, the glass-walled breeding facility was soundproofed by all kinds of magic, so the chimera could not even hear anything.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Edward hummed and poured mana into a magic circle like pouring water. The magic circle maintained the entire breeding facility and the habitat of the chimeras.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His mana flowed through the magic circle to a large magic stone in the center. Then it fused with the mana stone’s mana and spread throughout the chimera breeding facility.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Woah--!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Edward admired the slightly dark aurora that arose as the magic circle reacted with the mana. The sight of the beautiful scene that always unfolded with magnificent magic was one of the few pleasures for Edward, someone who lived a difficult life as a researcher at the magic tower.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ha~."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I yawned, Flam looked at me with surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What is going on that you would be yawning?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I laughed as I rubbed my eyes that were still a little sleepy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What, I’m capable of yawning too, you know."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having decided to look around the magic tower, I had ended up exploring until late last night. Of course, the opportunity wasn’t just limited to yesterday. There were still six days left for training at the magic tower. However, I thought I would be able to see everything in two days at the most if I searched like last night.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I planned to start searching systematically, from public space used by the magicians to where the magician’s research results were kept then the Tower Master’s research.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, it’s because it’s my first time seeing you yawn. You didn't even yawn in that boring magic class."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The magic class at the training center was definitely boring as it was at the basic level, but that didn’t mean there weren’t interesting parts. In fact,</span><span>&nbsp;during the boring parts</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, I created an illusory clone of myself in my place and took a nap behind the lecture room. Even then, I had never been caught because of my sensitivity to people’s presence.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That’s because I am a model student."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>If you didn't get caught sleeping secretly, you'd still be a model student. Since I managed to keep my magic class grades from getting poorer, I was booed by&nbsp;</span><span>Flam</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;for showing off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We made the aphrodisiacs together, so how come your grades were higher than mine?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Hut</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, this is the difference in ability."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, I stretched to try to wake myself up. I needed to take a nap as soon as I got off work today.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Tuk, chang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, I felt something get caught on my hand and I could hear something falling and breaking on the floor. It seemed the arm that I had been stretching had hit the shelf where the empty flask was, causing it to fall off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah, I made a mistake."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The evaluating civil servant looked at me with eyes that said, “Again?” But this time, it was truly an accident.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Really.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The deductions were going as planned, but somehow it felt unfair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Tower Master of the Red Magic Tower knelt reverently before a parchment paper that was neither very luxurious nor clean.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, Great Ram! This weak one offers my humble gratitude for allowing me to see your knowledge."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like a fanatic was with the Bible, the Tower Master carefully picked up the parchment he had read over and over, and read it once again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"I can't believe there&nbsp;</span><span>had</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;been such a method!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He blamed himself for being insignificant before having read the parchment despite already knowing the contents.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The endlessly unsatisfied magician, the Tower Master, read the parchment again and again.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;He checked and rechecked to see whether he had misread or misinterpreted anything. He read it like so hundreds of times. Then he finally put it down carefully after having gained confidence in what he had read and interpreted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Tower Master kowtowed heavily to the parchment in a reverent manner.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you for teaching my inadequate self, oh, great magician.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tonight, the magic experiment of Ram, who the Tower Master followed, would begin.</span></p>
