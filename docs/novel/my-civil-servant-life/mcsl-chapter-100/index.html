 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In the middle of the barren demon territory wilderness, absent of any vegetation, Gawain tried to regain his breath and swung his sword. Gawain's opponent was a large rhino demon called a&nbsp;</span><span>collabulgon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. It had the body of a rhinoceros and was more than 5 meters tall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain slashed at the black collabulgon’s horn but wasn’t able to cut it off. Despite only leaving a scratch, the collabulgon became furious at the damage on its big, tough horn. He shook his head wildly, striking powerfully at Gawain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Keup</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!" Gawain tried to reduce the impact as much as possible with his sword, but the collabulgon’s strength sent him flying. Swinging his sword widely in the air and turning his body, Gawain looked for a place to land.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unfortunately, another collabulgon was rushing towards him in the direction that Gawain was flying towards. It was evident that if this continued, he would be hit by the collabulgon’s horn before landing on the ground and wouldn’t be able to avoid immediate death.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Gawain's body gradually fell and approached the collabulgon, Gawain let out a strong shout and poured mana into his sword. Then he gave a powerful swing, released a huge amount of mana, and shot an aura blade <span id="footnote-ref-fbb7"><a href="#footnote-fbb7">[1]</a></span>at the ground.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the tremendous number of aura blades being suddenly shot towards it, the collabulgon tried to stop, but its weight and momentum prevented it from stopping where it wanted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The incoming aura blade accumulated damage and scratches on parts of the collabulgon’s horn as if it had been weathered by time. In addition, the left shoulder and front leg were covered with weak leather in comparison to the horn.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a result, it became blood-stained, and the white bones could even be seen on its thick leg.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Moo-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!!” The&nbsp;</span><span>collabulgon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;screamed in pain, and Gawain used the aura blade he shot towards the ground to twist his body in mid-air, landing on the back of the suffering collabulgon.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From the top of the violently trembling back, Gawain concentrated on the sword aura and slashed the back of the collabulgon’s neck. With this deep gash on its neck, the collabulgon collapsed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Gawain jumped off the limp&nbsp;</span><span>collabulgon’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;back and checked his remaining mana. From now on, he could use his sword aura five times and the aura blade once before his mana was drained, and he collapsed from exhaustion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Realizing this possibility, Gawain smiled. "That’s enough."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After Gawain landed on the ground, he immediately rushed to&nbsp;</span><span>collabulgon</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, as it sent him flying through the air once more. The collabulgon was angry at the death of his friend and decided to charge at him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Five meters before Gawain and the collabulgon would collide, Gawain wrapped his sword in sword aura and swung it at the floor. He also jumped as if he was doing a pole vault.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite seeing that Gawain was jumping over his head, the collabulgon was moving too fast to slow down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain leaped into the air and shot two sword auras into the ground to create a cloud of dust. This was meant to block the collabulgon’s view and lower its movement speed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Landing behind the collabulgon's butt, Gawain ran towards its head. Although it was moving wildly, it was not enough to make up for its obscured vision.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After he arrived in a flash, Gawain cut off at the back of the collabulgon’s neck with his sword aura. The collabulgon rolled forward with the momentum from his charge as it lost its life.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain jumped sideways before the collabulgon’s large body could fall forward. The collabulgon continued rolling for a long time and made a cloud of dust.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain sat down and provided sweet rest to his nearly exhausted body. After a moment of time, the dust settled, and the collabulgon's corpse could be seen lying on the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain looked around disinterestedly and checked his condition. Gawain's body didn’t have any major injuries and only bore slight bruises and small scratches from rolling on the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite the minor injuries from hunting thirteen large demons alone, Gawain was still depressed. This was because the blade of his mithril sword had become chipped from colliding with the collabulgon’s horn.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately, his reserve sword was made out of the strongest metal, adamantium, and was still intact. However, to better suit Gawain’s skillful swordsmanship, the mithril that conducted mana was better than the hard adamantium.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ohh, are you done with the hunt?" Asked Elder Mirpa as he walked from a distance. He was dragging a dragon corpse that was tens of meters long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain stood up and answered, "Yes, it is over."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Mirpa looked around Gawain and clicked his tongue, "</span><span style="font-style: italic">Tch</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, you've mangled all the important parts."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm sorry. My skills were insufficient,” Gawain said, as he had no choice but to lower his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was because the dragon that Mirpa hunted had no wounds other than the killing blow. Considering that even a dozen collabulgons combined couldn’t handle a dragon, the gap between Mirpa and Gawain was clear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"It’s fine. It’s still very impressive considering your age. Besides, that kid Mac isn’t here. It can't be helped since you can only display your full abilities alongside&nbsp;</span><span>Mac</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mirpa's words pierced Gawain's heart. It was no different from saying that he couldn’t display his skills properly without Mac.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He knew that he had always partly relied on Mac. And yet, without Mac, it felt as if he couldn’t muster even a quarter of his strength when he battled great demons.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't be too hard on yourself. It's all because of the way that old man Weger taught you. Well, to be honest, putting you with him helped you two grow faster, so I can't say that it was necessarily wrong."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain and Mac were disciples who had trained under Elder Weger. Gawain was planning to take this opportunity to train himself to be able to show his skills even by himself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having rested enough, Gawain got ready to move out and asked, "Do you think I can be Den’s opponent outside of the forest?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Mirpa thought for a little bit before replying,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"By yourself, no, but if you team up with that kid, Mac, the chances are low, but I think it is possible.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is that so..."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Seeing the somewhat disappointed look, Mirpa laughed, "</span><span>Kkeul-kkeul-kkeul</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but don’t you have an advantage inside the forest?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mirpa said that Den caught a dragon when he was 12, but considering his personality and having seen his brothers before, he likely wasn’t just thrown in front of a dragon. The odds leaned greatly towards him digging all sorts of traps the day before, or even two days before, and then barely managing to capture it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That reality was something that both Doomstone and Gawain had guessed. However, no one paid attention to the fact that in the Crow Tribe, the wisdom of digging a trap was part of one’s power and ability.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the first place, there was no way he could catch a dragon even with traps if he didn’t have the strength to support it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Den can't use his power in the forest." Despite saying so, Gawain’s eyes were burning with triumph.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mirpa spoke to Gawain as he put the carcasses of the dragon and the collabulgons into his pocket space, "Even I’m not certain I can win against that brat, Den, outside of the forest. So, of course, it’s impossible for someone who isn’t even an adult such as yourself."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain swallowed, his mouth dry, "Is the difference that great?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, under the premise that magic would be allowed, the chance of me winning is high in a short-term battle. However, a long-term battle would be advantageous for that Den brat. The kid’s got a huge mana tank. As far as I know, even when compared with the Butterfly Tribe known for their naturally large mana capacity, he has a larger tank than even the crazy old man, the great elder of the Butterfly Tribe.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Simply put, Mirpa was above them in terms of magic level.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was only natural that the skills obtained through Mirpa's teachings still did not reach Mirpa's own level, which had been developed through many years of living and learning countless magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet, fighting with magic was another story. This was because there were other factors that decided the outcome outside of just simple things, such as who prepared more and one’s current condition.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, inside Olympus forest, one’s level would determine the outcome. The Olympus forest was an environment that prevented intervention of external factors. Olympus was not a place called the Magician's Hell for nothing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I see,” Gawain mumbled bitterly, then continued as if he had thought of something suddenly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, Miss Orphina called to ask if we could stay where the imperial army is positioned for a few days until someone comes to replace her, as she is leaving in a few days.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mirpa stroked his chin. “Orphina? That Dragon Tribe broad?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Gawain nodded, Mirpa asked with a worried face, "Who's coming along this time? Bloody? Or the Butterfly Tribe?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"They said it was someone named William, so I think the Butterfly Tribe."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Mirpa looked at the imperial army camp in the distance with an interested gaze. "Really? Seems like someone who can communicate with us is coming this time. That Dragon broad is too closed up.&nbsp;</span><span>Kkeul-kkeul-kkeul</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Mirpa's laughter, Gawain asked, "What should we do?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mirpa pointed above a large mountain. "What do you mean ‘what should we do’? The Chief is here, so we should follow Doomstone’s decision."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mirpa did not believe in Doomstone's wisdom but definitely believed in Doomstone's almighty instincts. Doomstone's instincts were at a level of foresight that could be considered to have reached the field of magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"By the way, it seems Father is running late."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mirpa laughed once again at Gawain, "Kkeul-kkeul-kkeul, he’s probably running late from facing five dragons at once. For him, it’s probably more difficult dragging the carcasses back than it is hunting them.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Dealing with the five dragons was something that Doomstone used to do easily in Olympus Forest. As such, there was no way it would be difficult to deal with five dragons when the restraints on mana were lifted outside of the forest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Anyways, it’s almost that time. In a few days, the capital will be lively with the New Year's Festival.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is the capital’s New Year's Festival different from the New Year's Festival in our village?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain’s question made Mirpa recall some old memories. "Well, could I say it’s the same and different at the same time? Having fun and watching fights are the same."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh! Is that so?" Gawain’s eyes glittered like a grandson listening to his grandmother's old story.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing such a sight, Mirpa told the story of his New Year's Festival from the past like a kind grandmother. "Well, for the Crow Tribe, it’s probably boring, but there used to be a martial arts competition at the New Year’s Festival. When I was young, there were no such things as civil servants in the Empire, so I don't know about now but at the time....”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Achoo!" While in the midst of volunteer training for the martial arts competition, I suddenly sneezed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Who was talking about me?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you all right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, I’m fine." I received the handkerchief that Flam handed over worriedly and blew my nose into while speaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">Paeng-</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uh... well, just keep it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I laughed mischievously as I saw Flam looking at me with a wry smile. "Why, what’s wrong, aren’t we close?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"No, no matter how close you are, isn’t&nbsp;</span><span>snot a little</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, you know."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What, what’s the matter? Here." I separated my snot-filled handkerchief that I had hidden under Flam's handkerchief and returned Flam's dry handkerchief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flam received his handkerchief in amazement.</span></p>
