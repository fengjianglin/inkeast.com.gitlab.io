 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac missed the timing to avoid it and was forced to narrowly catch the spear shaft with his left hand. He didn't like to resort to dealing with things by force but nonetheless attempted to lift Malecia up by the spear and fling him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>However, Malecia, with his vast experience on the battlefield, let go of the spear and retreated&nbsp;</span><span>with perfect timing</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>With&nbsp;</span><span>Malecia’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;weight suddenly disappearing, Mac stumbled backward, and arrows flew towards him at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Chaeng! Chaeng!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Mac quickly regained his balance and struck down the arrows. He evaded Malecia's sword,</span><span>&nbsp;the other was attempting a quick stab and run</span><span>. Then&nbsp;</span><span>Mac crouched down and tried to slice his abdomen.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;However, Malecia quickly dodged, filled the sand with mana, and kicked it into Mac's face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At the unexpected attack</span><span>, Mac raised his left arm to shield his face and gathered mana to block it then he rolled</span><span>&nbsp;on the ground once and quickly sprang to his feet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since dealing with Malecia, the desert terrain had started to really annoy him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wow, I've never seen anyone fight so cowardly since the youngest master.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Haha, that youngest master knows&nbsp;</span><span>how to fight.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia struck back at the fuming Mac. Somehow, the way he talked even seemed similar, it scratched at Mac's nerves.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, isn't it too cowardly for a man called the Mercenary King?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Mercenary King is a position that's hard to survive in unless you are cowardly."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who was it that asked to be called a black knight?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Who knows? He’s not here at least." Malecia rambled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I thought he was in front of my eyes. Maybe it’s someone else.” Mac took a jibe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"A person today is different tomorrow. Aren’t you fortunate to be having such big realizations?"</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>At the&nbsp;</span><span>condescending&nbsp;</span><span>teaching&nbsp;</span><span>attitude</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Mac decided to go all out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>He&nbsp;</span><span>hadn’t been serious up until now</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, but he decided to fight seriously go all out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">No, I'll just kill you.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Huhu, die Youngest Master!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>A terrifying sword aura came out of Mac's sword and shot towards Malecia. It contained an aura that seemed to want to annihilate everything. The paladins, turbaned</span><span>&nbsp;men</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, and even Malecia all rolled onto the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahahaha! Do you know how much I was beaten up by the boss for losing the youngest master!!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac unleashed his sword aura as if he was pouring out all of his feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Ahh! Mac has gone crazy!"&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;exclaimed in fright.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The target was definitely Malecia, but the effects of his sword aura resonated everywhere. Meanwhile, Malecia, the quarry, continued to run away from the sword aura all along feeling this was unfair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Retreat! Everybody retreat!" &nbsp;Malecia cried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All his men began rolling and running away. The surrounding troops had already retreated. With only Malecia and his men left to flee now, there was no need to stall for time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia and his men quickly got on the camels and ran towards the Holy Land Zaharam.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac looked oddly relieved and did not chase after them. Rather than thinking that there was no need to fight if the enemy was running away, it was more because he was satisfied that all his stress was relieved. In addition, it would be annoying to chase after them and get lost while getting back to Lancelot and Leisha.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>When&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;saw the scene, he thought Mac had intentionally pretended to go crazy and all out in order to drive away the enemies. He felt that even if it was Mac, a Crow, he would still be exhausted after releasing sword aura like crazy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Even the paladins supported by Hillis felt fatigued from the great battle that resulted in thousands of&nbsp;</span><span>cut</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;wounds. So of course, he thought Mac would be even more exhausted since he did not receive any support.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We are returning to Miss Saintess."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Around the carriage where Hillis was, there was a large tree with arrows stuck like a cactus.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Under the tree, Leisha was meditating.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After kicking open the carriage and coming out, Hillis exhaled deeply, sweat-soaked her entire body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, I'm gonna die, I’m so tired! Water! Ha, ha."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling a sense of exhaustion in her whole body, Hillis looked for water first.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you for your hard work! Here's the water."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Hillis, who received water from her servant, sank into a squat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>She had been supporting the paladins with her divine power for a long time. She had remotely treated the wounded paladins who&nbsp;</span><span>had charged</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;to deal with black magicians a total of 3,796 times. If it was an ordinary priest, he would have reached his limit after just 10 minutes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As soon as she saw the five men trudging along, she first looked at Mac. "Are you hurt anywhere?" Hillis's support and healing were set to respond to the paladins’ divine power so Mac had received neither.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"As you can see, I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Mac raise his arms and gesture, Hillis was relieved and nagged at the paladins. “I told you not to get hurt so much because it tires me out.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I'm sorry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Looking at the grim-faced paladins, Hillis sighed. "</span><span style="font-style: italic">Phew</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, it’s fine since you came back alive.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The paladins, who were depressed by her words, looked up emotionally.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Get ready for the camp. I'm tired."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The paladins that remained to protect Hillis moved and immediately started to set up camp. Fortunately, thanks to the tree that Leisha had made, there was plenty of firewood. However, the problem was the black magicians and their troops that fled to the Holy Land Zaharam.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia and his men pushed the weary camels and headed for the Holy Land Zaharam. When he saw the huge tree from afar even though it was at night, Malecia drove the camel slowly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That tree was the very reason Zaharam was called the Holy Land.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he approached the tree, a familiar village resembling an ancient ruin, came into sight. That village was Zaharam, the Holy Land.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was hard to see in the dark at night, but the tree boasted a size so huge that it could cover all of Zaharam.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not a sound could be heard when Malecia entered Zaharam. Unlike its name, here was a village of ruins that did not give any feeling of vitality. But this was a place that one would never expect to be in a desert.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The crumbling stone structures that resembled ancient ruins were shrouded in ivy. And at the center of Zaharam, a huge tree that exuded a strong aura of vitality stood tall enough to raise the question of whether it could grow in the desert.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The ruins looked like it should belong in the middle of the jungle but somehow was in the middle of the desert.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zaharam's tree was called the Divine Tree or the World Tree and emanated a special power. That power prevented not only humans but also insects from living. Because of this, even the temple that managed it could not stay here, and could only travel from the remote oasis village to guard it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In reality, Zaharam was a place that did not need guarding at all. The power of the World Tree encompassed Zaharam, making it impossible to destroy the ruins here. It also made it seem as if&nbsp;</span><span>it had stopped time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>When Malecia entered Zaharam, the power that always enveloped him when he came made him feel nervous. He massaged his chest. There was a magic&nbsp;</span><span>necklace</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;resting on his chest. The magic on it scattered the power, allowing them to stay here for a long time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The necklace that</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;most soldiers had was a crude item made by the black magicians that could not last over 15 days. However, Malecia’s necklace was an item that was semi-permanent, and specially bestowed by the person he served.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Going deeper, Malecia came to a wooden fence. He frowned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a barrier that was definitely not present when he had left Zaharam in the morning. There was only one reason for this wooden fence to be put up: they were holding a ceremony.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Stop! Stop or I'll shoot!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the wooden fence, their bows pulled back, the archers took aim at Malecia and his men. This was because it was the middle of the night and Malecia and his men did not have torches.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">And the reason they didn’t have torches was that they had lit up the battlefield but still ended up retreating without being able to retrieve the torches.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Malecia and his men came to a gentle halt, the soldier on the wooden fence asked, "Who is it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Special Task Force Captain Malecia!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers guarding the wooden fence all hesitated at the same time. Even so, they did not put away the arrow on the bow.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Black!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Starlight!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“13!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“37!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Having confirmed the passphrase and code, the soldier came down from the wooden fence and said, "I will now begin the process to verify your identity. Please wait a moment!" With a torch in hand, he opened the side door on the wooden fence and came out to approach Malecia. "Oh, I'm sorry!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia patted the nervous soldier's shoulder and spoke. "No, well done. But next time, just throw a torch from above and check the face. If I were an enemy, your life would have been in danger."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you!" The soldier saluted, he seemed moved.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Malecia smiled lightly and went into the&nbsp;</span><span>b</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">arrier.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Inside the wooden fence were tents originally erected outside of Zaharam. Malecia clenched his teeth at the sight. Those soldiers did not have the necklace made by the black magicians that Malecia and his men had. Deploying those ordinary soldiers that could not even handle mana properly in Zaharam was the same as shaving off the lifespan of those soldiers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, there would be no issue if it was just for a day, but them being stationed there during the period of the entire ceremony at the altar was evidence these soldiers were expendable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Malecia looked around the tents with a serious face, he spotted the commander in the desert setting up a tent with a hammer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hammer was wrapped in bluish mana, but in order to hammer in holding pins into a land that was dominated by the World Tree’s power, both the hammer and the pin needed to be wrapped in sword aura.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You’re working hard."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Captain Malecia! I am glad to see that you are all right."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander only noticed that Malecia had arrived when he spoke, but he was relieved to see him as he wiped off his sweat. The fact that he had left Malecia and just retreated with his own men had been bothering him. Although the decision was made to save the soldiers, it was inevitable that he felt guilty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia, reading his mind, patted the commander's back. "Did you think I was going to die because I couldn't deal with five people?" His tone seemed light and he even smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But the commander shrank back seeing Malecia's eyes that were overflowing with danger. He felt as if the other was yelling, "Did I look so weak to you?".</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah, no. I'm sorry."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia was somewhat sullen. The reactions were always like this when he joked. Sighing inward, he whispered to the commander that it was a joke while patting his shoulder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Be prepared to leave any time.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes? But—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander cast a curious look, but Malecia shook his head in silence in all seriousness. Then, he went straight to the altar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">(End of Part 1)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The altar was located in the largest building at the center of Zaharam. Perhaps the building was a temple in the past because it was imbued with the aura of holiness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia couldn't understand why the black magicians were doing black magic experiments in a place like this, but they who were preparing for the ceremony were serious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The altar was in the room that was furthest inside the temple. Out of the 300 people assembled here,&nbsp;</span><span>twenty were black magicians</span><span>&nbsp;and the remaining were ‘</span><span>rabbles’ that did the bidding of the high-ranking black magicians.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Malecia</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had fought countless battles, to him, the people here and those outside were far from being considered a magician. So he didn't like the way they acted as if they were real magicians.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah, so you arrived?" One of the black magicians got up from his seat and approached Malecia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia grasped the other’s neck with one hand and hauled him up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Kuh, Kuck!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;What... Why!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What are you doing?" An old man in charge of the ceremony and in the highest seat among the black magicians was angry. However, Malecia ignored the old man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Was it you? The one who rejected the request for magic?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The black magician who was being strangled by Malecia, realized that this was because he had refused the request to create light with magic when they were attacking the Saintess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No... no... I!"&nbsp;</span></p>
