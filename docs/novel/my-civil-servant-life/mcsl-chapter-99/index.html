 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody was walking through a corridor leading to the secret conference room with his niece, Leisha, Lancelot, and Mac, who came as envoys from the Crow Tribe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uncle, why is it so winding and complicated here?” She complained even saying that it was humid and smelled of mold.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody gave a light smile. "When inviting anyone other than the originally designated people to the secret meeting room, it was decided that we would only use this closed path."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The secret passageway that they were walking on was so&nbsp;</span><span>dilapidated</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;that it was closed and the work to dig a new passageway was in full swing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Do you have any questions before we arrive?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I do! Bloody-nim!” Lancelot’s hand shot up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Without the nim. Yes, Lancelot."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How much progress has been made in finding Den?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After giving permission to ask questions as if he were a teacher, Bloody turned his head away when Lancelot queried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“——”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes? What did you say?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With his eyes wide open and head tilted, Lancelot’s gaze fell on Bloody. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes were not.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody walked one step faster and avoided his gaze. "Sor-sorry. We couldn’t find him.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes? What did you say?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same tone and expression as just before, Bloody quickly clung to Leisha and whispered, "I think his personality has changed."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Lancelot he had seen after arriving at the capital was definitely a naïve and shy boy. But suddenly, his voice had changed as if he had done a complete turn and became a little scary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha whispered back with a forced smile, "He becomes like that when it comes to Den, but it's okay when you get used to it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is that so?" Accepting it with a slightly quivering voice, Bloody changed the conversation. "But there are people who can help us at the place where we are going. So yeah, you can just tell Arcanta!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody handed the baton over to poor Arcanta, who was already busy because of the collapse of the Red Magic Tower.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But Mac smiled mischievously at the sight. "Ay, Bloody-nim. You shouldn't give your work to someone else.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody shot Mac a look, telling him to be quiet but the guy didn't stop his playful smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't you agree, Lancelot?" Mac put his arm around Lancelot’s shoulder and asked into his ear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot nodded. "Yes, I agree. What should I report to the Village Head?" His lips were smiling, but his eyes were absolutely not.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"Come on, wait! Hold off on telling hyung-nim!" Bloody waved his hands in a hurry and at the same time, he hi</span><span>d</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;behind Leisha's back.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Bloody, who was trying to figure out how to deal with the current interrogation, looked at Mac. "Yes! I’ll&nbsp;</span><span>te</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">ll you why Mac grew such a strange beard and has a strange way of speaking!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hold... hold on! Why are you dumping this on me!" Mac was so surprised that he even forgot to use his unique speech.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You started it first."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Bloody-nim! No, Sahyung! How can you do this when we are disciples under the same master?!"<span id="footnote-ref-8b53"><a href="#footnote-8b53">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The desperate Mac even brought up and complained about their old relationship. Both had followed under Elder Weger of the Crow Tribe. So Bloody had always told Mac to call him&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">sahyung</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;when he was back in the hometown. However, Mac had always politely called him Bloody-nim.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Shut up! How long has it been since I left from under Weger ahjussi!"<span id="footnote-ref-f46c"><a href="#footnote-f46c">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's my fault! Sahyung!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody smiled triumphantly at the sight of Mac who seemed ready to kneel down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha was struck by Bloody’s words. “So why is Mac oppa like that?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That's--”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Bloody tried to answer, Mac shouted strongly. Then suddenly, the place above the secret passageway wall opened, and a person popped out of it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Just how long are you going to keep making a racket?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was Arcanta with dark circles under his eyes. Everyone became silent at his appearance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, are you here to pick me up?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Bloody greeted him gladly, Arcanta nodded with a tired face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You look tired?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta roughly scratched his head. "Ah, someone knocked down the Red Magic Tower last night. We don't know who, why, and for what purpose they destroyed it. So I got up at day break to order an investigation, get a damage report, and create a plan to rebuild the magic tower."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I saw it in the morning too, but that huge building was really broken down." Bloody stuck out his tongue.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta rubbed his face from the fatigue. "Hahm~, but we can take solace in the fact that there were luckily no injuries or deaths. Just this once, I’ll have to thank the guy named Lupin.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">According to the testimony of the magicians and guards who were still researching in the magic tower, they said a person wearing a half-white mask came and rescued them from the falling magic tower.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Taking the lead as he yawned, Arcanta opened the door to the secret conference room.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Come on in. I apologize for having called the envoys from the Crow Tribe so secretly. But I thought that if I had met you in the imperial palace following official procedures, it would have been a nuisance for you. Thus, I called you here.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot bowed as the representative and replied, "The emperor is immeasurable. Your Majesty, We are humbled that you thought of us-"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, no. This isn't such a formal place, so you don't have to observe court etiquette." The emperor cut off Lancelot and looked at him curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So there is a person in the Crow Tribe who knows court etiquette."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Arcanta gave Bloody a side glance, the latter clasped his fingers behind his head and pretended to be oblivious.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After everyone gathered in the secret conference room and introduced themselves, they all sat at their own seats and began the meeting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"For the special guests, during this meeting, we will discuss the escapee, Small Chief Denburg Blade of the Crow Tribe."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With Arcanta words, a discussion on capturing Denburg began. Everyone spoke their minds, but there were no actual practical plans offered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac, the only one to keep mum during the discussion, asked, "But whose portrait is that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The portrait that Mac pointed to was the result of Bloody hiring an artist to sketch Denburg.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What do you mean who, of course, is that not the Denburg you are looking for?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the crown prince’s reply, Leisha and Lancelot looked confused while Mac burst into laughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Puhahahaha</span><span style="font-style: italic">!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;You are saying that that’s the youngest master? It’s my first time seeing a portrait that looks so dissimilar.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha elbowed Mac and hinted at him. The people who were gathered here were all powerful. She was worried that the vice-captain’s lack of etiquette would appear disrespectful at a time like this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But no one pointed out Mac's behavior. On the contrary, everyone looked at Bloody with embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"See? I told you! It doesn't resemble him at all!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They looked at him with a look of injustice. At that time, Arcanta took out and showed the portrait that Bloody himself had painted, just in case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yep, it's Den."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, it's Den."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It is the youngest master.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta tore at his head at the sight of the Crows saying, "It’s Denburg" from looking at a portrait that could have been better drawn by a child.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the moment that proved that Bloody was indeed the Crow Tribe's best artist.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia entered a mansion situated deep in the mountain with a large marble lifted over his shoulders. He inserted the marble deeply in front of the simple burial mound in the courtyard of the mansion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only things in the burial mound were a magic wand and an old battle-scarred armor that his friend wore in the past when they used to go into battle together as youths.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they were young, his friend was so lousy at magic that if he didn’t wear armor, one would have wondered if he could have survived a day in the battlefield. He was that much of a weakling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Such an idiot." Briefly recalling the days of their youth, Malecia murmured dejectedly. He opened the cheap wine that his friend had liked and poured it in front of the burial mound. "What’s so important about the truth? It's natural for a person to die of old age."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After pouring about half of the wine bottle on the burial mound, Malecia drained the remaining in one go. Perhaps he felt it even more with his aging body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mighty mana of a magician doesn’t deteriorate, but a warrior's strong body would rust easily.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Keuu</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, I don't even know why he loved something so much that doesn't even taste like alcohol."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia roughly brushed the red-flowing wine around his mouth with his sleeve and pulled out his sword. He focused his mana on the tip of the sword to create sword aura and etched letters on the marble.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">-January 1562 A.D ~ December 1625 A.D. Smith Adam Farhan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Pursuit of the endless truths.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The words were so elegantly engraved that no one would have believed that it was roughly dug out with a sword. The wind blew away the marble dust from the tombstone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia looked back in surprise at the sudden gust of wind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aries, donning a black mask, slowly walked out of the mansion from behind Malecia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The mansion belonged to Aries, but it was located within the empire, so he never thought Aries would come all the way here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The fact that the Aries, who usually never left his base located outside of the empire, came all the way here meant that he had teleported.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Salute! Welcome."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>When Malecia quickly sheathed his sword, knelt and&nbsp;</span><span>prostrated</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, Aries raised a hand and gestured to say that it was not necessary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia quickly stood up and bowed his head in shame. "I am sorry. Without permission—"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No." Aries cut off Malecia and spoke. "It’s fine. Is this Smith's grave?" he said in a dry tone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia nervously replied, "Yes, it is."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aries was usually not interested in anything but magic, so he tried to explain just enough to pass by. However, the other somehow arrived just when the tomb was built. Malecia was worried that he might go on a rampage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>But &nbsp;Aries's behavior was the exact opposite of&nbsp;</span><span>Malecia's</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;worry. He took out a bottle of liquor, small enough to fit into the palm of his hand from the pockets of his robes, and opened the lid.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The bottle opened with a&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">‘pong!’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and a profound aroma spread out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia had a hunch that it was not ordinary liquor. He swallowed the saliva in his mouth and quietly watched the other.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aries freely poured the liquor over the burial mound.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The heavy drinker, Malecia lamented the fact that a liquor that was certainly world class, was being poured out. At the same time, he couldn’t understand why the other would come all the way out here and pour alcohol.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The experiment failed. It seems Smith is gone too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia’s lamenting mouth suddenly closed at Aries's words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is that so?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia was thinking about how to face his friend who succeeded in the experiment, but realized it was unnecessary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Why was his heart in so much pain when there was no need to worry?&nbsp;</span><span>The death of a friend was something that was familiar.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Was it because it had been too long since a friend died?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Aries</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;turned around and headed back inside the mansion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't die.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Entering the mansion, Aries closed the door without looking back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After gazing at the door of the mansion for a long time, Malecia answered with a hoarse voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Tears&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">poured out endlessly from his eyes like rain.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The sky was definitely clear. It must be a sun shower.</span></p>
