 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, it seemed obvious, but there were so many books that my older sister’s study or Elder Mirpa’s lab couldn’t even compare to it. The scent of old books after a long time made me a little excited.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My oldest sister’s study was always full of new books, and Elder Mirpa’s lab had the smell of herbs rather than the smell of books because he believed in existential-orientation rather than theory.<span id="footnote-ref-683d"><a href="#footnote-683d">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As you would expect from a magic school, the library bookshelves were full of various magic books. I scanned the titles of the books and read the ones that sounded interesting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Introduction to Spatial Arrangement, The Fundamentals of Flight, Astrology and Necromancy, the theories of the four great magicians who dominated modern wizards - book of curses, the relationship between cadence and incantation…</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Most of the books were regarding the foundations of magic or the history of magic. Although the books didn’t go in-depth, there were still many interesting books since I wasn’t knowledgeable in all magic. Particularly, the book regarding a curse magician of the four great magicians who introduced his theories caught my attention as curse magic was very new to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As I wondered if a non-student could borrow books and headed towards an empty desk, I noticed a familiar smell. It was very subtle, and I walked towards it nonetheless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Located on one side of the bookcase, it was a faded book that smelled familiar. I wondered where I’d smelled the fragrance as I reached for the book.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I wasn’t the only one who reached for the book. I grabbed the book at the same time as a girl with white hair that had a touch of gold.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Go ahead and read first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I conceded the book to the girl with white hair. She smiled and nodded slightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pulling out the book I had conceded, the white-haired girl took a glance at me. To be exact, she looked at the book about the curse magician that I was holding.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You seem to have a lot of interest in the four great magicians?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pardon?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her sudden question made me look at the book she was holding. The title of the book was “Preservation and Management of Alchemic Medicine”, a book about alchemic magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The important part wasn’t the title of the book. The name of the author written in the book felt very familiar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mirpa Ainsmall?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elder Mirpa, my as well as my sister’s teacher, was the author of that book.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was now that I realized that the familiar smell was the smell I had been inhaling for years, the scent of herbs that filled Elder Mirpa’s workshop.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, Mirpa Ainsmall, one of the four great magicians, a renowned alchemist of the Crow Tribe, is the one who wrote this book. It’s a book that’s considered to be the foundation of alchemy now, but when it first appeared in academia, I heard it caused a revolution. But didn’t you grab it knowing that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah yes. Of course. I know that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Honestly, I tried to grab it without knowing. Others would look at me strangely if I said I didn’t know something that seemed like common knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The white-haired girl smiled while carefully stroking the cover of the old book.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I read a print of it, but I didn’t know that the original would really be here. Just as I heard, it really does have a peculiar smell of herbs.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She put the book to her nose and sniffed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“This smell is&nbsp;</span><span>wolyeong</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;flower, crane fly grass, and~”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mandrago’s third petal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The white-haired girl who couldn’t think of what it was and was frowning, smiled when she heard me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s right! Mandrago’s third petal!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As she shouted, feeling good, the librarian who was passing by glared at her while putting her index finger to her mouth. She looked down with a pitiful expression, and the librarian sighed and went on her way. The girl then spoke to me in a small voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hehe, I made a mistake. You must be very proficient in alchemy. It’s not well known that each of the Mandrago flower petals has a different smell, but you even managed to identify which petal it was.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I just laughed off the white-haired girl’s words with a smile. There wasn’t a need for me to tell others that I could use magic. It was safer to just make it seem like I had some interest in magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, I just guessed but got lucky.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even still… Ah, I’m Yuria.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The white-haired girl, Yuria, firmly held onto the book with her left hand and stuck her right hand out for a handshake.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m Den.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a sudden handshake, we introduced ourselves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria walked closer to me and whispered, “If you happen to have some time, would you like to discuss about magic?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her asking with shining eyes felt like I was getting accosted for directions in front of the subway. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, I have things to do~”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, I have things to do too. But it would be a shame since it’s been a long time since I met someone proficient in alchemy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria approached another step with beaming eyes. Then she grabbed my hand and made an eager face. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling her mana, she seemed to be a magician with considerable skill. A person of her proficiency would probably be considered a little stronger than my younger sister. Considering that a magician of this level was here, the magic school, where many of the best talents from the empire gathered, could not be ignored.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at her young face, she and I were probably the same age. If a magician of her level was a student, then what about a teacher?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From what I heard, the civil servant training center formed a partnership with the magic school, so the students could learn magic for a short time. I was looking forward to it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ok, then briefly.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I succumbed to Yuria’s pressure. At my consent, she led me to the terrace with a bright smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the library’s terrace, as you would expect from a library, there was a table for four people and some chairs. Yuria took a seat first and I sat across from her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, come to think of it, are you a student at the magic school?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria asked as if she just had the thought. I shook my head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, my skills are not very outstanding. My level is around barely knowing the ‘ma’ of magic.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, is that so. No wonder I could hardly feel any mana.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She seemed a little disappointed. Then suddenly, she smiled brightly and said, “Well, it’s all right! They say that everyone outside the village has weak mana.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Excuse me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a nuance that I seemed to have heard before. It was familiar because I used to frequently hear in my hometown that people outside were all weak.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, no! Well, ah! Since alchemy doesn’t really need that much mana! Yes, that’s what I was trying to say!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For some reason, her being flustered and trying to explain herself was so funny that I ended up laughing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, what I meant was~”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She became even more flustered seeing me laugh. It seemed that it was impolite to say to someone studying magic that they had low mana.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thinking I should make fun of her a little more, I hid my mischievous smile and said, “Even alchemy needs a lot of mana once you reach a high level.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is that so?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I thought Yuria would get more flustered but instead, she asked with beaming eyes, “Yes, even if you use a mana stone, it’s the alchemist that controls it, so you need an appropriate amount of mana to control it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The girl in front of me thought that I was an alchemist, but I didn’t consider myself one. However, when I was being taught by Elder Mirpa, he threatened to not teach me any magic if I didn’t memorize the contents of his research. So I had to learn it. But honestly, one could say that half of my magic was self-taught.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“By the way, it seems that you have a lot of interest in alchemy. Is alchemy your main focus?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria shook her head. “No, it’s elemental magic. My grandfather is an elemental magician.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She said something like what an esteemed daughter of a magician family would say. Certainly, I was the weird one for not pursuing alchemy like my teacher. Usually, people follow their teacher just like this girl.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My younger sister was good at magic other than alchemy due to my influence, but alchemy was still her main focus.<span id="footnote-ref-063d"><a href="#footnote-063d">[2]</a></span> The trees that tried to catch me when I was escaping were also made from alchemy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Usually, people only pursue one main focus, but it seems you are quite interested in alchemy too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah, actually I like not only alchemy but also all other magic as a whole. However, the land in my hometown is a bit barren, so trees and grasses don’t grow well. So I came to the capital to try and learn alchemy.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then you aren’t a student?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria nodded as I trailed off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Nope. I’m here to take the entrance exam.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The conversation with Yuria continued until 20 minutes before the start of the magic school’s entrance exam. I gave her only a little insight into my&nbsp;</span><span>alchemic</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;knowledge, and in return, she told me the things I didn’t know about elemental magic. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Initially, I felt like someone who was abruptly accosted for directions, but actually, it turned out to be beneficial.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For your information, I couldn’t borrow the book because I wasn’t qualified. They said I could borrow it if I became a student in training, so I planned to leisurely read it later.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the entrance of the last city, Warrant, which was nicknamed after the famous Valhalla, Leisha shouted at a group.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ah! Let’s grab a room and take a bath first! A bath!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha complained immediately after arriving in Warrant. They had been camping for 15 days since leaving the village, so she felt very uncomfortable with all the accumulated sweat and dirt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac sighed as he looked at the grumpily complaining Leisha.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Miss, His Excellency, the Diplomat has some places he needs to stop by first.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“His E</span><span>xce</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">... what His Excellency? Vice-Captain Mac, he is undeserving of that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A slim, pretty boy became red and flustered. He felt burdened by the fact that Mac, who was selected amongst all the warriors to lead, was calling him ‘His Excellency’.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You can just call me Lan. Den also calls me that~”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, Your Excellency the Diplomat will be the one leading us in the future, so how could I call you that? Personally, with respect, I would like to call you Sir Lancelot,” Mac said with a mischievous smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“Sir, what do you mean Sir? It’s too much.” Lancelot lowered his head as his already red face became even redder.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha argued with Lancelot with a face that didn’t care.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Rather than that, why isn’t lodging first? It should be a bath first, then a warm meal! I’m sick of provisions!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For Leisha, who had never been out of the village, the half-month of traveling was quite a hardship.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot shrank as Leisha bullied him.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac’s well-defined features became even more pronounced as he smiled and tried to calm Leisha.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Haha, Miss please calm down. His Excellency, the Diplomat surely is saying this because he has a plan.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But still!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Besides, if we think about having spent half a month in the forest, it was because of Miss.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha could only flinch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac, who was top three in the village for speed, seemed weak next to Lancelot, who was the top in both speed and stamina. So compared to them, Leisha seemed to move at a snail’s pace. It took 15 days because shortly after leaving the village, Mac carried Leisha on his back. If she had walked on her own, they would have been in the forest for another half month.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling ashamed, Leisha bickered, “Aren’t you being a little too blunt?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“This is how I am,” Mac replied confidently with a face full of pride.</span></p>
