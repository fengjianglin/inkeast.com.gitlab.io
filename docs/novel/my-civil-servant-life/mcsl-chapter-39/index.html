 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, it’d be lying if I said I was confident.” Lisbon smiled with a slightly tired face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come to think of it, is Alice’s exam the day after tomorrow?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yea, the schedule says hers is before mine, but she told me not to come.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alice was well aware of Lisbon’s situation and was being considerate. Even so, the fellow seemed a little disappointed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hey, Den.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m sorry but could you go to Alice’s exam instead of me? It’s an open examination but it bothers me that I might not be able to go cheer her on.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I sighed inwardly.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">How is he worrying for someone else when he has his own problems to deal with?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I don’t know how hard the knight school examination is, but the difficulty level of the magic school examination was included in the information regarding the magic I bought from the informant. So, as a pretty competent magician myself, I knew that Alice was stable.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The content of the exam was all about practical skills, but considering you just had to hit and damage a target 50m away with attack magic or fly up at least 5m in the sky, it was just a trivial level of difficulty. &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I don’t know what there is to even worry about, it’s not like you had to destroy a 50m radius without any trace, or fly random number maneuvers at high speeds 5000m in the sky!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Perhaps they were going to create an environment similar to Olympus then use magic?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Surely there was no way you could tell the difference between good and bad at this level of difficulty. For example, it was like using the level of difficulty of a driver’s license exam for a college admission exam.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If somehow my prediction were correct, then Alice was definitely going to fail. That’s too bad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, since I’m done with my exam, I’ll head over pretending to just take a look around.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I might as well take a look at some of the magic books at the magic school while I’m there. Even if it was not something like a dangerous grimoire, the library was open to nobles. So, I’d slowly take my time looking through them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Tonight, I should organize some of the information regarding the magic school.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Thanks!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With that, he headed towards the center of the garden to swing his sword again with a brighter face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It’d be nice if he passed since he’s trying so hard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In front of the Butterfly Tribe village’s warp gate, a grandchild was starting a new wave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alphonso, can you not go?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso’s grandfather, who was also a grand elder of the Butterfly Tribe, hugged the boy and implored in tears.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Grandpa, don’t cry. It’s making me sad too!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After seeing the two weeping last night, Yuria was dumbfounded to see them crying again today.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The grand elder stretched up his left arm and called Yuria since his right arm was holding Alphonso.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yuria, could you not go either?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sighing, Yuria went to hug her grandfather.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Grandfather, it’s one thing if Alphonso doesn’t go, but he makes me worry, so I can’t help it. Besides, you can’t study alchemic magic here.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the Butterfly Tribe, if there was one magic that you couldn’t freely study, it was alchemy. Alchemy required a lot of ingredients, but unless one left Everest, it took too long and was difficult to obtain various samples.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yuria, Alphonso!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As she wiped away her grandfather’s tears, Yuria thought the reason her brother was all teary was that he felt just like their grandfather.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After separating the two, they headed towards the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Father, Mother, Grandfather. I’ll be back safely.” Yuria bade goodbye.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her mother and father nodded and replied, “All right, make sure to send letters often. Should something happen, don’t hesitate to tell William, and write to us too.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If anything happens, Mom and Dad will hurry over, so don’t worry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yuria~”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The grandfather called out to Yuria while crying. The girl smiled and headed for the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, I’ll be off.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Mom, Dad, Grandpa, we’ll be off now .”&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso, while waving his hand, also headed for the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Alphonso~”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite hearing the voice calling for him, Alphonso tightly shut his eyes and ran into the gate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Beyond the gate was an empty room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Huh? I thought Uncle would be here?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria replied to Alphonso’s question. “You didn’t study, did you? My goodness, how did you manage to create a pocket space with that kind of understanding of space.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hahaha, well...Through will?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria mumbled an “I shouldn’t even have asked” as she left the room.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William was waiting outside the room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>“You arrived earlier than expected? I thought I was going to have to wait longer because of my&nbsp;</span><span>dad clinging</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;on to you guys.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I know. I thought so too, but he let us go more easily than expected.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Well, that’s a relief.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As William smiled, Alphonso who was hesitating at the back, rushed towards William.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Uncle!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Aigoo, boy. You’re an adult now. You need to consider your weight.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hehehe.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>As he patted Alphonso’s head, William spoke. “I’ve applied for your admission, but you’ll have to take the test first. Yuria&nbsp;</span><span>is heading to magic</span><span>&nbsp;school, and Alphonso to</span><span>&nbsp;knight</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;school, right?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The entrance exam for the magic school won’t feel like anything if you’ve successfully passed the coming-of-age ceremony, but the knight school has a sword competition so you need to be careful.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Don’t worry! Because I’ve trained hard!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing Alphonso trying to show off his biceps on his thin arms, William laughed and rumpled up his nephew's hair.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hahaha. Well, even if magic is the main power of our tribe and we don’t match up to the other battle races in terms of body strength, at least we still have the strength of an average knight, so you don’t have to worry. But still, you will fail if you use magic. So be careful.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Also, a knight under me will take care of you guys after you unpack, so push off touring the capital to tomorrow.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">2 days later ----</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After breakfast, Alphonso gallantly went out to the knight school alone.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before he left, his twin sister, Yuria told him to wait so they could go together, but with the memories of yesterday’s tour, he bravely showed his courage to go alone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I can go by myself!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even so, today is the day of the exam. What are you going to do if you get lost?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso faltered briefly but William backed him up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So what, the school isn’t even far away.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William cheered Alphonso on as he said that it’s not a bad idea for Alphonso to try going alone as it’s not like he could always accompany Alphonso every day.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William reassured Yuria by saying that even if Alphonso got lost, he could use location tracking magic to quickly find his way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then, I’ll be off!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bidding an enthusiastic goodbye, Alphonso cheerfully left as he opened his black parasol and his braided white hair dangled behind him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The whole of yesterday, Alphonso had toured around the capital with his twin sister Yuria and Uncle William. However, compared to the Butterfly Tribe village located on Mount Everest, the busy streets of the capital were full of color and life and were on a completely different level.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With beaming eyes, Alphonso looked around again at the streets of the capital.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso passed by the main road as he looked around. As people continued to bump into the parasol which he was using owing to the tribe’s weakness for the sun, he continued to apologize as he headed to a street with few people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he got out of the bustling street and took a step back to breathe, he heard an angry voice from behind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ow!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Alphonso turned around, there were three men giving off a scary impression. Among them, the man rubbing his left arm raised his right hand and put on a scary face. It seemed that he had been scraped by the parasol that Alphonso was carrying.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The parasol that Alphonso was carrying had been specially made by his grandfather. It was created from the flesh and bones of the Behemoth, one of the strongest monsters on the Alps mountain that was known to be a monster haven.&nbsp;</span><span>Considering that the fabric of the parasol was made with magically coated yarn of heavenly silkworm</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;fabric, which was several times stronger than steel of the same thickness, one could say it was a weapon by itself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Why you!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment a sly-looking man, behind the man who was about to attack, raised his hand to stop the man and whispered something in his ear. The sly-looking man put on an odd smile and looked over to Alphonso.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso felt that something was wrong and apologized.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sorr... I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, the man gravely yelled at Alphonso’s apology.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you joking right now! Huh!? If you hit, huh, a person, huh, you need to give compensation!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso was frightened when the man with the threatening face suddenly shouted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Sorr... I’m sorry.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Is it over if you are sorry!? Since my arm is broken, hand over 3000 pelks!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The man seemed like he was about to hit him. Alphonso suddenly shut his eyes in fear and threw out a punch.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Finally, the morning of Lisbon and Alice’s entrance exams arrived.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Saying she was nervous, Alice skipped breakfast and holed up in her room refining her magic. Also, saying that eating too much would dull one’s body, Lisbon really ate little compared to his usual large meals and went out to the garden in light clothes to stretch.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without Lisbon’s usual banter, the dining table became rather quiet. Mrs. Arscilla and I were the only ones left at breakfast and had some conversations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Come to think of it, Den, if you pass the civil service examination, will you be going to live in the dormitory?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, since that is apparently the rule, there’s not much I can do.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mrs. Arscilla spoke with a truly sad face. “Since you have to move to the dorms by the end of July if you are admitted, it’s really going to be such a short time. I’ve been fond of you this past month.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like Mrs. Arscilla said, somehow it’s already been a month since I started boarding here. The results of the admission exams would be announced in half a month, so at most, I’d have to leave here in a month.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I know not about other things, but the thought of not being able to eat the meals here made me sad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It is definitely unfortunate, but you know the results still have yet to be revealed. If something goes wrong, I might have to burden you for another half a year.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was just saying that. I even sneaked into the palace to check the question paper, so there was no chance of failure. The actual exam questions being so easy made me feel dumb for putting in all that effort.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Also, even if I pass, I’ll have to look for housing again in half a year so I may have to be indebted to you again.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mrs. Arscilla smiled at my shameless remark, telling me to come any time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After breakfast, I slowly took a stroll towards the magic school. Although I say I was heading towards the magic school, the knight school and the civil servant training institute were attached to it, so technically you couldn’t just simply call it the magic school.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since my goal was the magic books at a level under a grimoire stored in the school, there was no need to hurry. Especially since Alice, the one who was taking the exam was still holed up in her room.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As I was going to the school, a black umbrella amid the crowd came into view.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Why an umbrella? The sky was so clear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter where you go, there are always weird people. As I was going through a shortcut through the back alley without thinking, I heard a voice shouting from somewhere.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you joking right now! Huh?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oh! A fight! The best things to watch are a fight and a fire. It’s even better if the people fighting had nothing to do with me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In order to secretly watch the fight, I sneakily moved towards the alley where I heard the sound.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“If you hit, huh, a person, huh, you need to give compensation!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Contrary to my expectations, the scene in the alley was of 3 gangster-like guys tearing apart a fragile-looking boy with a black umbrella.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">How disappointing!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Even if it wasn’t a brutal dog fight, I was hoping to see some street fighting. &nbsp;</span></p>
