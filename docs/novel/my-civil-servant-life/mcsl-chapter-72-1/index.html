 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A month and a half before Arelia's birthday ball, the end of July.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>After exchanging money in Warrant, Lancelot and his group left the&nbsp;</span><span>Olympus&nbsp;</span><span>F</span><span>orest</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;and headed to the capital to persuade the runaway Denburg Blade. At least, that was supposed to be the plan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where are we!?" Leisha shrieked while pulling at her head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how many times you looked around, all you could see were sand dunes and the clear sky. The temperature was too high to be called the beginning of summer. The experience of the harsh desert, which she had previously only read about in books, left Leisha desolate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Sor, sorry," Lancelot apologized timidly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha sighed, "No, you haven’t done anything wrong. Isn’t. That. Right? Vice-captain, sir!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha glared at Mac with eyes as fiery as the burning sun of the desert.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hmm! That’s right. Sir Diplomat has done nothing wrong. Well, of course." Mac dodged Leisha's gaze and gave a fake cough.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To start with, it was because of Mac that they made a wrong turn and ended up all the way south in the desert rather than going southwest to the capital. Despite Lancelot’s suggestion to hire a guide from Warrant and take a train once they were halfway to the capital, Mac was confident that they didn't need a guide.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot shouldn’t have believed Mac when he began to beat his chest. Mac started telling him to believe in the skills of the former division vice-captain who had experience traveling through Olympus Forest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unlike the time in the forest, Mac didn’t know how to orient himself in the grassland and gradually turned southward from the original southwest direction without even realizing it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Mac also had something to say, "But Miss can't say that you're innocent either.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, that was an unavoidable accident. Yes, let’s call it an accident." Leisha became red as if she felt guilty about something and turned away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yes, Leisha had a hand in them being adrift in the desert now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After visiting the first village coming out of the grassland, the group realized they had gone astray from the original path.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be specific, Lancelot realized it, but the other two did not. Lancelot explained their situation and once again proposed his desire to hire a guide to travel back northward. Once that was done, they would try to get a carriage from a city and travel to a more bustling area where a train was located.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yet, when Leisha saw the merchants stopped by the village, she said it would be safer to move with the traveling merchants and offered a gold coin. Lancelot was worried about the display of such a significant sum, but he comforted and convinced himself into thinking he was being naive and that nothing would happen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He believed it would be more reliable to have traveling merchants as a guide than a person who did not leave the village often. However, he should not have hidden his worries this time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Instead of guiding them northwest where the capital was, the traveling merchants took Lancelot and the group south to the desert. Filled with greed at the sight of the bouncing coin purse that Leisha and Mac carelessly tied to their waist, the merchants immediately turned into bandits when they arrived in the middle of the desert.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a small mistake made by two people born and raised in the forest solely because they didn’t realize the value of money. The bandits picked on the wrong group, and every one of them had their graves dug there with Mac’s fists.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac was not good at controlling his strength, but he cautiously planned on leaving one alive to serve as a guide. However, he did not imagine they would die so easily. From this, you could tell how well Denburg managed to control his strength when he first fought the gangsters after leaving the village.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The punks ended up surviving.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha pointed out that Mac didn’t even leave one person alive, while Mac claimed that it wasn’t all his fault. This was the situation just moments ago.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If only I had spoken a little more clearly...” Lancelot said critically.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha and Mac became flustered and consoled him, "No! You did a good job!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes! Without Lancelot, I’m afraid I'd cry thinking of the grim future!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Leisha looked disapprovingly at Mac, "No, a grown-up&nbsp;</span><span>crying is</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;a little...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ay, I'm just saying,” Mac gave a peculiar sly smile, and Lancelot quietly burst out laughing at the sight of it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s nice to see you laugh like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, yes, they say good luck comes when you laugh. Now let's listen to Sir Diplomat's valuable advice on how we should move forward."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lancelot blushed in embarrassment, "</span><span>It’s, it’s</span><span>&nbsp;not very</span><span>&nbsp;valuable</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;advice, but I think it would be better to find a nearby town."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That's a good idea!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That's right!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling a bit guilty, Leisha and Mac tried to encourage Lancelot.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Since Leisha noona is a magician, how about she tries to get a better view up in the sky?” Mac suggested.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha looked around awkwardly before declining, "Well, it's a good method, but there are two problems.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What is it?” Mac asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"First of all, because it’s a desert, even if I saw a village while flying, we may not end up heading in the right direction due to mirages created from differences in temperature," Leisha explained.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I can just go there myself and find it,” Mac stated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha shook her head at Mac. "It would be different if we were familiar with this desert terrain, but I think that once you leave this spot, you won’t be able to find the group again."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since villages were large, she would be able to find one quickly, but there was no way Leisha could find the two of them again in this desert where everything looked the same.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then what if you took us in the air with you?" Lancelot asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha lowered her head towards Lancelot and muttered in a very small voice, "Sorry, I've never actually used flying magic before.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac heard the voice that was as soft as the sound from an ant and thought that Leisha was just joking. "What? The youngest son has been flying around the village since he was a kid.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac leaned over to see Leisha's face, who was keeping her head down. When Mac made eye contact with her, Leisha screamed as if she was ashamed of her skills.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That’s because he's a genius! I had a hard time just floating off the ground while I was in the village!" Leisha was partially crying and began to lament her distress.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"In the first place, people aren’t supposed to fly! People have to live on the ground! It's odder that a person can even fly in the sky!" Leisha continued.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Miss, it couldn’t be-" When Mac began speaking with astonishment, Leisha turned her head away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes! I'm afraid of heights! I've never used flying magic since I fell from a height of 20 meters while learning flying magic when I was young!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Only then did Mac realize why Leisha did not fly the same way that Denburg did to chase him when he ran away from home. It wasn't that she didn’t fly, but that she couldn’t fly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, she might be able to fly if she closed her eyes and used the flying magic. Unlike the time when she was young in the Olympus Forest, the current location was not a place where mana was chaotic. In addition, Leisha's magic skills were obviously among the ranks of great magicians.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Leisha, who had a fear of flying, felt unsteady just from lifting off the ground.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Listening to Leisha's lament, Mac stopped looking at her face and leaned back, smiling, “Then there's nothing we can do. Everyone has something that they’re afraid of."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac's abruptly sincere eyes combined with his handsome face made Leisha’s heart race slightly. However, after seeing him starting laughing slyly once more while stroking his goatee, all of her feelings dissipated.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, perhaps due to a few lingering feelings, her face was a little red as she asked Mac, "Is there anything Oppa is afraid of?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac thought for a moment before he winked and brought his index finger to his mouth. "Huhu, it's a secret.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Mac’s smile grew even more sly, a strong urge to punch him grew in Leisha’s mind. However, her opponent was also one of the most powerful men in the Crow Tribe village. He was one of the most talented individuals in the younger generation of Crows. With such a strong physique, he could dodge a punch from a 10-year-old Leisha with his eyes closed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha had no choice but to tolerate him, "What shall we do then?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Leisha sighed, Lancelot was sent lost in his thoughts again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, didn’t Den use magic to find a vein of water back then? Can you use that magic?" He asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha quickly understood what Lancelot was trying to say, "Water vein? Ah! You're looking for an oasis village! You're smart."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha ruffled Lancelot's hair while praising him as if she was proud.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hehe, no. I just remembered what Den once said." Lancelot said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What did Den say?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot answered Leisha's question with a bright smile. "In the past, Den said that if we were ever lost in a remote place alone, we needed first to secure water then food.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Pondering on how they would get water, Lancelot recalled the existence of the oasis village, which he had learned about at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Among the magical materials that Elder Mirpa asked for, there were some that could only be acquired in the desert, so luckily, he learned about them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Really?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes! And, and! Den also once taught me how to survive in the desert!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Lancelot became excited and showed signs of going on a long-lasting ramble, Mac naturally interrupted him. "Then let’s look for it! Miss!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seemingly not wanting to hear Lancelot's admiration for Denburg either, Leisha replied in an exasperated voice, "Shall we?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was no stopping Lancelot when he started going on about his admiration for Denburg. It was amazing how his skillset was nothing like Denburg’s, even though he talked about him so much. Both Mac and Leisha knew that the gap between Lancelot and the Denburg was too wide.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot looked regretful as Leisha focused on her magic, choosing to wait for her to complete her work. Even if they couldn't find a village, securing water in the desert was a matter of considerable importance.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I found it," Leisha said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh! Where?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha pointed south and spoke, "That way."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Before heading for the oasis, they dealt with the former traveling merchant’s belongings. They put the bandit’s items into Leisha's pocket space at Lancelot’s suggestion. Leisha felt uncomfortable, but she followed along because she was guilty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do we have to take it?” Leisha asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Leisha spoke again after putting all the belongings into the pocket space, Lancelot nodded as if praising the question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Den says that every action has a purpose, and if it has a purpose, the means-"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Now! Shall we head off before it gets dark?" Leisha interjected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac agreed with Leisha, who quickly cut Lancelot off.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Good idea!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha and Mac held Lancelot's arms as if they were arresting him, walking quickly in the direction of the oasis.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Huh? Uhh?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot was confused as he matched their quick pace, not understanding why Leisha and Mac were walking so fast. The desert sky was so clear that the North Star seemed to be visible already.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot believed that every single one of Den's words could serve as a guide, just like the Northern Star in the sky. Then he realized that the reason the group was walking so fast was to arrive at the oasis before nightfall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, only Lancelot came upon this realization.</span></p>
