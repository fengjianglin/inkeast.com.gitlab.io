 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old black magician who continued the ceremony in front of the altar felt its power. Due to the absence of the carnelian crystal that was supposed to suppress the World Tree’s power and ensure the stability of the ceremony a great deal of power was being consumed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man had even used his men's mana and soul as a sacrifice to forcefully start the ceremony. But now was the limit. It was self-evident that the ceremony would fail at this rate.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He then sensed the footsteps coming from behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Is it the black magicians waiting outside?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">No.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;It was obvious that if it were the black magicians, they would have felt the mighty power coming out of the altar and not approached it. If so, the sound of the approaching footsteps meant that the paladins had arrived.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man bit his lips. He didn't even know when they had charged in because he was too engrossed in the ceremony. However, reaching this far was no different from saying that they had dealt with all the black magicians outside. It was obvious that he would fail at this rate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man got rid of his nervousness and let go of the control of the ceremony.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Glory to the great person."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man sacrificed himself to make the ceremony a success. The mana of the altar greedily tied up the body of the old man eventually swallowing him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The altar began to emit black light.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Get down!" Leisha exclaimed as she suddenly felt the mana wave intensify.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot and Mac crouched.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha quickly conjured up a spell so that they wouldn’t be blown away by the mana waves. She let out a coarse breath after enduring a few minutes of violent waves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Huha!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The perspiring Leisha ran to the source of the mana wave without even taking a break to wipe off the sweat. Feeling nervous and tense from the unknown ominous mana, she prepared herself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the room deep inside the temple, there were the bodies of the black magicians, an altar, and an old man.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man stood dazed at the altar. Then his head turned in the opposite direction of his body and looked at them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the old man’s head turn at an impossible angle, they realized that he was no longer a human but something that was in the shape of a human.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, Mac quickly wielded his sword and shot a sword aura towards the monster in the form of an old man. It was the result of instinctual discomfort and rational judgment that the monster needed to be eliminated immediately.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The monster raised his hand and tried to stop the sword aura by shooting out black mana, but the arm was cut off before it could conjure up the black mana.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-&nbsp;</span><span>Akniatkyu Yiseokyi</span><span>. (Is this a body?)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The monster shook its truncated arm in a strange manner while making an incomprehensible sound as if the sound was being played in reverse. Then the black mana wrapped around its severed arm and turned towards the truncated arm. And in an instant, the severed arm clung back to its shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then the monster looked at Leisha.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">- Ahnookssi ohkyiak reungukryuk yigohok. (You have the carnelian crystal.)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the same time as the sound, the monster gave off a grotesque laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">- Ahtssuhssi ootreuduh reunitgyu. Ahdnatah mak akehun. ( I’m thankful to you. I was able to gain a body because of you.)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha didn't know what it was saying, but feeling goosebumps from it, she poured a lot of mana into attacking it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>- Apnuap anah reugitaht uinakni. Ahknigitap&nbsp;</span><span>uiahtniahtmak</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>yiseokyi</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. (Is this how humans respond to thanks? I’m learning something about human common sense.)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite Leisha's attack, the monster's body quickly regenerated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mana exhaustion made Leisha's body tremble. She felt like she was going to faint immediately, but she still closely observed the monster’s regeneration.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The altar...! Ugh! Ha-ah-ha-ah. The monster's mana is coming from that altar!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Leisha pointed to the altar with a trembling hand, without a word, Mac immediately rushed at the monster. Lancelot followed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The monster shouted as he saw Lancelot swinging his sword wrapped in sword aura towards the altar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">- Yanyissik neutoom! (What do you think you’re doing?!)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The monster ignored Mac slicing its body and tried to attack Lancelot. However, due to its physique, it could not chase after Lancelot as it kept having to regenerate from being repeatedly cut apart by Mac.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Lancelot hit the altar without mercy with his sword aura, it cracked and began to break.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>- Utbuh&nbsp;</span><span>neunoot</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>reugut</span><span>&nbsp;eckhurri! Ehtninit kyu the&nbsp;</span><span>ekhutt</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! Whetna! (No! I just gained a body! I can't die like this!)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac thrust his sword into its head. The monster wildly shot out mana in every direction to get rid of him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hurry!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sensing Mac's urgency, Lancelot smashed the altar with even greater strength.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac flew toward the wall from the monster's mana. Recovering from Mac’s cut, it attacked Lancelot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the monster was about to strike Lancelot, the altar was completely broken and the black light that was emitting from the magic circle on the altar began to fade. At the same time, the body of the monster began to turn to dust from the tip of its body, and the unmatched ominous mana scattered.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>- Leseok lesanna neunyitgut ehkurri ohtohssuhbuh namnitgyu. Ehtnineup reussehnwuh reuni&nbsp;</span><span>gyuuhjeul</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">… (I just wanted a body. I wouldn't have died like this if I didn’t have a body...)</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the monster disappeared completely, Lancelot collapsed on the spot after seeing its attack that had reached as close as his nose.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Hua</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! That was scary." Lancelot wanted to cry right away from relief and fear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After seeing the monster disappear, Leisha finally fainted after barely holding on to her consciousness.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oof!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac was flung with force enough to smash the walls of the temple, which had been supported by the power of the World Tree. Nevertheless, he ran over quickly and caught Leisha's body as it fell down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Aigo</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, my body is aching all over."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac slowly put Leisha on the floor and tried to move his body. He felt he had about three broken ribs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac, whose ribs had not broken just once or twice, naturally tried to take the Mirpa Special medicine out of the pocket on the belt.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh no. Lancelot, I think you should carry her on your back."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The impact from flying into the wall broke the bottle containing the medicine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I can't move my legs."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Lancelot looked at Mac with moist eyes, Mac sighed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The paladins had wiped out all the black magicians in the holy ground. They shook off the blood from their swords and resheathed them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you, Miss Saintess. Thanks to your support, we were able to wipe them out quickly."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Mario's greeting, Hillis smiled with benevolence. "No, it's all thanks to the strength of the paladins. Rather, I feel that I was insufficient and was just a shackle to you all, so I’m sorry."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That smile, which seemed more sincere and holy than anyone else, seemed to purify his heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mario was convinced of the rumors that the Saintess was kind to everyone and disliked those who were evil. His colleague and lover, Vibrio, always had a troubled smile whenever there was talk regarding Hillis. He assumed that she had that smile because she worried that if she openly boasted about her sister, then she may look foolish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"But Paladin Mario, how come you are here?" asked&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mario hesitated before he answered, "Actually, I came at the behest of Cardo Fernando."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"His Excellency, Cardinal Fernando?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes. He obtained information that there might be heretics in the southeast of the empire and told us to come check it out."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Albatoss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;nodded in response. "I see. Indeed, His Excellency is always at the forefront in punishing heretics."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Inside the temple, Fernando was with the hardliners. He was a devout believer serving as the head of the heresy interrogation department when he was young. If there were rumors about heresy, it was quite understandable that he would send his own paladins.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But how come Miss Saintess is—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Mario tried to ask, there was a sudden fluctuation of ominous mana.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"There must still be some black magicians left!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis and the paladins quickly headed to the source of the mana in indignation. The said source was inside a temple in the heart of Zaharam. The paladins became more resentful of the fact and went in.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As they entered the room at the deepest part of the temple, they saw the bodies of the black magicians, the broken wall, and the mysterious altar that was destroyed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, you’ve arrived? Miss Saintess, I’m sorry, but could you please heal me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Mac raised his hand from in between the black magician corpses, Hillis was shocked and quickly treated him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Eya, thank you.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After his ribs stuck back together in one go, Mac moved his body about. He found no abnormality. It seemed to be even more effective than the Mirpa Recovery Medicine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis asked after the ominous mana that still lingered in the room, and Mac told the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The altar was certainly destroyed."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mario checked the front of the destroyed altar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After pondering over Mac's explanation, Hillis spoke, "Could you perhaps come with us to St. Percival? I really want to give you a reward for this.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac stared at Lancelot, the latter naturally shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We have to go straight to the capital. We don't have time to go all the way to Percival."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mario and his subordinates were about to fume at Lancelot for daring to refuse Hillis's offer, but Hillis was quick to act.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">She approached Lancelot and said, "Who did you say you were looking for in the capital? The capital is very wide. It's going to be hard for just the three of you. But in our temple, there are so many believers. If I cooperate with you, it wouldn’t be hard to find a single person in the entire empire, let alone just the capital."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot said without even a moment’s thought, "We will go. St. Percival."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If they could get Hillis's help in finding Denburg, it may take less time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the past, Denburg the wise man told him to use all the things that could be used.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the middle of the mountains somewhere, a middle-aged man rode a horse to visit an old mansion that had ivy and vines climbing its walls.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia, the one-eyed man, had been riding for days without even being able to bathe. He tied his horse to a nearby tree and went straight into the mansion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He entered the mansion without knocking or wiping off his shoes and headed straight to the second floor. He took a deep breath in front of the largest room in the mansion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Knock, knock!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The door opened on its own.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Inside the room, an old man in a black mask sat still in his chair, looking out the window.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Malecia entered the room, the door closed by itself. He knelt on one knee on the spot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I am sorry. I failed the 'experiment' you ordered."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man in the black mask spoke calmly, "Is that so."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reaction indicated that everything that happened in the Holy Land Zaharam was good. He wondered if he should ask for the name of the old man, who had commanded him to try and succeed. But the question was truly useless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'll have to prepare for the next experiment.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The old man in a black mask got up and picked up the letter lying on the table. The paper had twelve constellations and a picture of a sheep.</span></p>
