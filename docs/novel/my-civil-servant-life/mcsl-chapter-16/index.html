 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, I brought him because he was sitting outside in the rain."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oppa? This isn't our home. It was okay before because our house had plenty of rooms, but we're going to the capital right now. We should be thinking about our finances!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In contrast to her brother, Alice seemed a bit wiser. She reprimanded Lisbon, then directed her attention at me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hey, you can't just follow people because they tell you to."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her words made such perfect sense that I was at a loss for a response.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, don't be mad at him Alice. I brought him over by force. This is Den Mark."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I could tell Alice was close to getting mad as she grabbed Lisbon by his collar.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you kidding me? How many times have you done this? Huh??"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was regrettable that there was no popcorn as I watched the brother and sister grab each other by their collars. It was always fun to watch a fight as it was very thrilling and always felt like a new experience.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, hahaha, that's....”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That sucker was trying to count with his hand.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Whatever!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alice loosened her grip and headed straight for the stairs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where are you going?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't know! I'm going to sleep!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alice angrily went up to her room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, she's not usually like that. I think she's just tired from the long journey."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I think she's tired of you, not the trip.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Come sit down for now. What would you like to eat?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I became really determined not to turn out like him as I watched Lisbon smile and hand me the menu. I could really learn from watching his behaviour. Moreover, it was rude to refuse when someone was offering a favour. I looked at the menu and placed an order.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Chicken stew and rye bread please."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I actually wanted to eat wheat bread with beef stew, but it was three times more expensive than the chicken stew and rye bread. It was also rude to buy something expensive when someone else was paying for me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How is that enough to make you full? Hello? I would like to place an order."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes~~"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'd like to order two chicken stews, three rye loaves of bread, stir-fried potatoes, and an omelette, please."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, please wait a moment."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The waitress received the order and went into the kitchen. The food came out quickly afterwards.&nbsp;</span><span>It made sense since the food</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;I ordered didn’t take long to cook.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">By the way, having the name von in between your name meant that you were a noble. Considering that Lisbon was a noble, he didn’t really spend a lot of money.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if he had noticed my gaze, Lisbon responded with an awkward smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, actually, I had to spend a lot of money on the way here....”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In short, he had spent too much money trying to help people on the way here.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was no wonder his sister was mad at him. But let's be thankful since he was buying me food.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I decided to use this opportunity to expand my limited knowledge of the world. "I had something I was curious about."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What is it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What are the prices in the market like nowadays?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What?" Lisbon looked surprised by the unexpected question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Usually, people would have asked, "Why are you so nice to me?" However, since I already knew it was because he was a sucker, I thought that it would be better to use this relationship to accumulate some knowledge.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I come from a rural village so we mainly trade through bartering."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn’t just rural, but really really rural. The nearest city from my hometown was at least 1,000km away. A "currency" still existed, but it was mainly by-products from demons or items like dragon's scales. Thanks to this, my pocket space was filled with all kinds of demon and dragon by-products. Of course, I had caught them all myself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Come to think of it, if I were to sell demon by-products in the market, wouldn't I be able to get my hands on some gold and silver?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I should visit the market again tomorrow to look around. Additionally, if I could find some banks, I could deposit my platinum coins and withdraw them as change.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I see. It is convenient to know the prices in the market. You know that there are eight kinds of coins: iron, refined iron, bronze, refined bronze, silver, refined silver, gold, and platinum, right?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Wow, this man’s looking down on me so much!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Of course!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"We use a unit called pelk as the base unit. It's an ancient word for shellfish. One iron coin is equivalent to one pelk."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I already knew this information from a book I’d read. I wanted to know more about the prices of daily items, but he was treating me like I knew absolutely nothing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"A refined iron coin is equivalent to five iron coins, so it’s basically worth five pelks. A bronze coin is worth twice as much as a refined iron coin, so it’s ten pelks. A refined bronze coin is worth five times as much as a refined iron coin, that’s twenty-five pelks."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lisbon quenched his thirst with water and then continued explaining.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A simple schematic of Lisbon's explanation went like this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Iron coin = 1 pelk, refined iron coin = 5 pelks, bronze coin = 10 pelks, refined bronze coin = 25 pelks, sliver coin = 2,500 pelks, refined silver coin = 25,000 pelks, gold coin = 250,000 pelks, platinum coin = 25,000,000 pelks.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Six or seven gold coins are enough to maintain a small territory, so it’s a lot of money.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oh, I see. You could maintain a small estate with six or seven gold coins. But I had asked the jewelry shop owner to give me change for a platinum coin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I'm sorry, jewelry store owner!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then what about platinum coins?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"At least a month's budget for a large territory owned by a count?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">I'm sorry, jewelry store owner!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, a platinum coin is an item of fantasy that a minor noble like me will never encounter. Even for gold coins, there’s only been a handful of times I’ve actually seen one—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Stop!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">My conscience's hp is already zero!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span>Since coins more valuable than silver aren't commonly used in real life</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, I'll just explain the coins that are common."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Lisbon, my pocket space is currently overflowing with platinum coins which you call an item of fantasy.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It seemed that giving away a platinum coin as a gift was more of a nuisance than I thought. I guess I could just pay him back next time if I encountered him by chance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This is an iron coin, this is a refined iron coin, and this is a bronze coin."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lisbon did not carelessly take out coins worth more than a bronze coin. Fortunately, he seemed to have at least that much common sense.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I would also show you refined bronze coins and silver coins, but my sister keeps all the big money."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Oh my god, are you stupid?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn't that he didn't want to show, but that he couldn't! I wouldn't be surprised if he ended up dying somewhere without his little sister.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But for ordinary needs, refined iron coins and bronze coins are sufficient."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lisbon pointed at the spread on the table and said, "It usually takes one or two refined iron coins to have a meal. Five pelks per serving for the chicken stew, one for the rye bread, two for the stir-fried potatoes, and three for the omelettes. In total it is 18 pelks."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">It turned out to be 18<span id="footnote-ref-09f3"><a href="#footnote-09f3">[1]</a></span> pelks.&nbsp;</span><span>How did I end up with this hopeless sucker? Did I really look that pitiful?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then how much does it cost to stay at an inn?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"This inn is maintained quite well, so it takes around ten refined iron coins. Usually, it's about five refined iron coins and I've also seen some places that go for less."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Places that cost less than that probably had substandard quality.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">By the way, if you are aware of this, does it mean you've stayed in those places before? That's pretty impressive for a nobleman!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If we include extra fees such as showers and tips, it'll cost around six refined iron coins and 2 bronze coins for the three of us.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Around six refined iron coins for all three of us. But three?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;This guy somehow naturally included me in the group.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was a wise decision for his sister to return to her room first. If she hadn't, she would have probably erupted by now and slapped her brother.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s hard to specify a price for other items since it varies village by village, but in general, one silver coin is the monthly budget for an ordinary family of four."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The monthly budget for a common household was probably a bit lower than what he said since he was from a noble background. Still, if I were calculating this correctly, he said that one silver coin was worth 2,500 pelks, and six gold coins were the monthly maintenance fee for a small territory. This meant that a small territory could hold around 600 to 700 households assuming they were all a family of four.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For a count who had a monthly maintenance fee of one platinum coin, his territory was equivalent to around 10 to 20 smaller territories combined.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I see. If you don't mind… may I take a look at your identification card?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I knew that this was a rude question. Asking for his identification card all of a sudden meant that I was suspicious of his identity. But I was helpless in this matter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was unable to freely show my identification card since anyone who saw it (although I only showed it to two people so far) would be intimidated and simply lower their heads.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What I wanted was a status that would prevent people from looking down upon me rather than making people bow.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>To be honest, I thought Lisbon would get mad at me over this.</span><span>&nbsp;Instead,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">he still took out his ID card without showing any signs of anger, which I couldn't phantom no matter how gullible he was.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Here you go."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He went as far as to just hand it over to me.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">What was this situation?</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Did this guy not know how to be suspicious? Didn’t it occur to him that I could just run away with his ID? Or was he just confident that he could catch me if I tried to run away?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I could understand this guy’s actions if that were the case.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I got the identification card from him and examined it closely. It was definitely different from my own. It was in the same format, but the size was two times larger. Besides, in contrast to the 15 different magic spells that had been cast on my card to prevent forgery, this card had 10 less than mine.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, looking at the address or name written on the ID, it did not seem that much different from other identification cards. It looked as if the material for this card was made out of some ivory or bone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"The texture of the card feels peculiar, what is it made out of?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well, as far as I know, it's made from ogre-bones. Of course, it's nothing compared to identification cards made out of demon bones reserved for nobles with the rank of count or higher, but it's still ogre-bones.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lisbon made an exaggerated gesture and continued on explaining.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s still pretty impressive compared to identification cards made out of elephant ivory for nobles at or below the rank of baron, or common identification cards made out of wood.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, that's pretty impressive."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Ogres...</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;I thought they were so common that you didn’t even need to go hunting for them intentionally.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Wasn’t it harder to cut down a tree near my hometown?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was hard to cut down those trees even with axes made out of adamantium unless you were imbuing sword aura into your sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you for letting me look at it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I handed the ID back to Lisbon. I used magic to memorize the form, size, and weight of the card though. I would look through my pocket space later to see if there were any ogre-bones to forge an ID.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While I had been examining the ID, the food on the table had disappeared. All I ate was chicken stew, half a rye bread, half an omelette, and a few stir-fried potatoes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guy in front of me had polished off two and a half rye breads as big as his face, as well as chicken stew, and the rest of the stir-fried potatoes. He ate it so cleanly that there didn't seem to be any need to wash the dishes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He had such a cheap sense of taste, that it made me question whether he was actually a noble.</span></p>
