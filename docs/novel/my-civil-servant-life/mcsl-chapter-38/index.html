 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria had spread out a large sheet on the floor to draw magic lines for a magic circle. When she saw William, she embraced him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, my! You’ve gotten a lot heavier."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Didn’t I tell you that you can’t tell a lady that she’s heavy?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Yuria puffed out her cheek, William raised her and made eye contact with her.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, yes. You’re still very light, so eat a lot and study well."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahem! William, long time no see."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William grinned and put down Yuria.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Father, have you been well?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, I've been well thanks to you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While Wiliam greeted his father, the girl showed interest in the man standing behind her uncle -- Bloody.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Mister, who are you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso introduced Bloody before he could introduce himself. "Mister here is a knight!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Knight?" Yuria had also never heard of a knight before.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody stroked Alphonso's head and laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, Mister here is a brave knight."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder stared at Bloody with an amused look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you from the Crow Tribe?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes. My name is Bloody Blade."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“You’re the son of the Crow Tribe’s chief. How are your parents?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hahaha, my father passed on his position to my brother and is currently on a journey."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder let out a sigh of envy. "I don’t know when I’ll be able to retire from this annoying position. I envy your parents."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William awkwardly smiled. "Haha, Father is still full of vigor."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That’s enough, boy. A man also needs to know when to back out. How is that man with a ferocious temper?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody smiled bitterly as he knew who the title of ‘ferocious man’ was referring to.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, Mr. Mirpa is still full of vigor."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hmm, that's too bad." Although the great elder said so, he looked inwardly happy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mirpa was one of the few rivals in the great elder’s life. It was a blessing to still have a rival at his old age.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William sent out Yuria and Alphonso while his father was in a good mood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yuria, Alphonso, Uncle has something to talk about with Grandfather. Will you go out for a while?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The twins nodded and left.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why did you come out?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the secretary doing her work outside the room asked, Yuria shook her head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"They said they had something to talk about for a moment."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Really? Then shall we hang out for a while?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso responded energetically to the secretary's suggestion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Okay! Nice!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The secretary brought out chairs, sat down, and started doing origami. Suddenly, the door to the great elder’s office was smashed and Bloody rolled out injured.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria who had briefly recalled the past asked her twin brother Alphonso.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But didn't you come here to call me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh right! Grandfather called us for the coming-of-age ceremony."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria checked her watch and shouted in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is it time already?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria pulled out a two-meter staff and a mountable saddle from her pocket space. She attached the saddle to the staff and said to Alphonso as she sat down, "Sit down."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"They told us not to fly outside the village because it's dangerous."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Alphonso hesitated, she simply forced him to sit at the back of the saddle then sat at the front again. "I'm not going to fly all the way into the village. 'Fly!'”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Yuria shouted out the spell, a magic pattern engraved on the staff started to shine and the staff rose into the air. In a flash, it rapidly flew towards the village.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso, who was riding in the back, started to scream.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s….Too….Fast…!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Fast!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Faster? Okay?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso felt like passing out when Yuria increased the speed. The siblings came near the village in an instant and touched down.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon landing, Alphonso dropped to his knees, placed both hands on the ground, and vomited.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uwheck-!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He then covered the vomit with snow and placed some snow in his mouth to rinse it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, sorry. It’s been a while since I flew so I couldn’t control my speed well."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">She definitely flew to get to Everest’s summit!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Alphonso felt resentful towards his lying sister.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"That’s so…&nbsp;</span><span>Uweeckk-</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!” He threw up again and stood up exhausted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria stroked his head with an apologetic face and cast a healing spell.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Recovery!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After a faint light, Alphonso felt his dizziness disappear.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When the recovered Alphonso tried to say something, Yuria grabbed his hand and ran to the village.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Isn’t the family waiting for us? Let's go already!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uh, yeah."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso made up his mind as he got dragged along.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leaving aside the fact if the person would be recognized as an adult, this coming of age ceremony determined whether the person would be allowed to go to the capital. As a tribe that mainly used magic, the Butterfly Tribe tested magical capability during their coming of age ceremony. Although the test was different every time, it consisted of magic that couldn’t even be attempted unless you were a great magician.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The test sometimes tested whether you could summon hellfire. On other occasions, it tested whether you could create ice with absolute zero temperature. In any case, the test was never easy. And in severe cases, some people failed the test and became adults at the age of 17 or 18 instead of 16.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As someone from the Butterfly Tribe, Alphonso was weak in magic. Nonetheless, he was determined to pass the test and enroll in the capital’s knight school.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon entering the village, the twins headed towards the senate which was located in the heart of the village. Just as the coming of age ceremony was held in front of the village hall where the chief of the Crow Tribe worked, the Butterfly Tribe performed theirs before the senate where their ruling group stayed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yuria, Alphonso, you were almost late."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria and Alphonso bowed their heads at the great elder who was the head of the Butterfly Tribe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Great Elder, I’m sorry."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's all right, Yuria. And call me Grandfather like you do at home."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder looked kindly at his granddaughter. At the same time, he looked worried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria was fine since she had shown overwhelming talent in magic since she was young. But his grandson Alphonso was less talented than others his age. Despite the fact, after listening to the black-headed guy called Bloody or something, Alphonso had started to train to become a knight by swinging iron sticks and neglected his magic training. Due to this, he had immense worry towards his grandson.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder who had been worrying whether his grandson could pass the ceremony, changed his mind at a sudden thought.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">If Alphonso doesn't become an adult, wouldn’t that mean he wouldn’t have to send both his granddaughter and grandson to the capital?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder pondered while looking at his grandson.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Alphonso, fail the test!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Don't leave my side.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">You're my lovely grandson!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although he wasn’t pleased with the black-clothed person, he was still a grandson that he doted on. If possible, he wanted his grandson to remain by his side until he lay in a coffin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Yes, I wish he could stay by my side for another 200 years.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder had recently broken a bottleneck and his lifespan had significantly increased as a result. With that much of a lifespan remaining, although he wouldn’t imagine his grandchildren dying before him, he hoped that Alphonso would be eliminated during the exam.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let the coming of age ceremony begin. As a test, create a ‘pocket space’."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What? Great Elder, originally-- "</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Shh!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder glared at his aide to make him shut his mouth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The original test was to fly 1,000m above the current location, but the great elder had changed the test content to create a ‘pocket space’ which was several times harder. Creating a pocket space was a symbol of a great magician, but its difficulty level was so high that it was a kind of magic even great magicians struggled with.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria immediately started to create a pocket space at the great elder’s words. For her who had already created her own pocket space, creating a new one instead of expanding it was quite a difficult feat. However, it did not take a long time for her to create one about a meter long.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha, as expected of Yuria. You could have just shown off the one you made before, but you actually created a new one. It's a pass."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then, can I get rid of this pocket space? The other pocket space is trembling because I’m maintaining both at the same time."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, get rid of it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria removed the new pocket space without hesitation. The size of pocket space could be expanded proportionally to the size of magic power, so there was no need to create a new pocket as long as the magic power was increased.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Next, Alphonso."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso began to make a pocket space with a nervous face. He sweated and spent an hour trying to create one.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Alphonso, if it’s too hard, you can try another time."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As if he couldn’t hear the great elder’s words, Alphonso focused his attention on creating his own pocket space and managed to create one with a length of 10cm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I... I succeeded?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After pouring in all his energy and magic power, Alphonso, covered in sweat collapsed, on the spot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria, who had thought Alphonso would fail the test, also applauded Alphonso's determination.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Congratulations!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder was also taken aback when Alphonso created a pocket space. He had thought Alphonso would fail with his current abilities, but he eventually managed to make one. If anyone had assisted Alphonso, the great elder as the greatest great magician in the village would have been the first to notice. As such, he was touched by the growth of his grandson, but he shed tears at the fact that he would have to say goodbye to both Alphonso and Yuria.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Good... good work. Alphonso... My baby."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Grandpa?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso and the great elder both hugged each other and wept.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But can you not go to the capital? This old man would be lonely without you and Yuria."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But- I want to become a knight."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’ll let you become one! The one and only knight guarding the village!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The great elder’s aide and Yuria shook their heads and let out a sigh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">You should control how much love you shower on your grandson. Does it make sense to create a meaningless position just to make him stay?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But...Still…."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yuria spoke on behalf of crying Alphonso.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Great Elder-nim? It’s time for you to go back to work! Alphonso should also go pack up if he wants to leave tomorrow."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Yuria pulled her grandfather away from Alphonso, the great elder reached his hand out to Alphonso.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Al~Phon~So~"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Grand~pa~"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at the show his grandfather was making, Yuria handed the great elder to his aide. It seemed like it would be a noisy night because of the two.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I felt a little disappointed when I came out from the civil service exam. The questions had been a lot easier than expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Why on earth did I spend so much effort trying to check the exam questions?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of course, it would have felt easy because I had looked through the exam paper beforehand. At this level, however, the paper was easy enough for me to manipulate my grade even without looking at the test paper beforehand. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Back at the boarding house, Lisbon was swinging a sword in the garden.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, you're back? How was the exam?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I think I did well."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Really? That's great."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lisbon came to me while wiping off his sweat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What do you think? Do you think you’ll be able to pass the exam in two days?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This time I asked Lisbon.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Due to transferring to the middle-rank knight school from family circumstances, the exam was trickier for him. If he failed the exam in two days, he would have to take an extra exam in half a year for selecting additional students. However, there were years in which they wouldn’t select additional students, which would result in Lisbon having to wait another year for his next exam. If he also failed the exam a year later, it would be safe to assume that Lisbon would have to give up taking elite courses as a knight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Enrolling in a knight school wasn’t the only way to become a knight, but it was the most orthodox and convenient way. Although Lisbon did not express it, it was vital for him to pass the exam.</span></p>
