 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first day of the ball, which also served as the Third Princess Arelia's coming-of-age ceremony, ended safely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arelia appeared later than scheduled but was received with applause and congratulations.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The first day's events were wrapped up with a dance between Arelia and descendants of several high-ranking nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For the second day, as it was Arelia's birthday, it was decided that the festivities would be hosted inside the palace, following along with tradition.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was customary for a birthday banquet of the imperial family to be held at a designated place, so the ball being held at the magic school became quite a big issue among the nobles.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Due to William and his subordinate’s magic, most of those who attended the ball were unaware of the night’s incident. There were some who noticed, but they had no choice but to keep quiet because it happened at an imperial event.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Aside from that, students from the magic school, knight school, and civil servant trainees were not invited, as the birthday ball was held at the palace starting from the second day.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hearing the disappointing news from Arelia, Mrs. Arscilla tried to invite all the boarding students, including Yuria and Alice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, as punishment for allowing Arelia to follow Lupin recklessly, Yuria was reprimanded and was not allowed to attend, even though she would have naturally been invited. That made the princess very gloomy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon hearing the news, Prince Zantes visited Arelia to wish her a happy birthday and offer small words of consolation. After a brief conversation, he told her to rest and left her room, heading for the secret conference room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After walking along the secret passage for a long time, he arrived at the secret conference room to find that all the seats except his and Orphina’s were filled.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You're late." The emperor greeted Zantes with a benevolent smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"My visit with Arelia delayed me. I apologize."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing as Zantes apologized with his head lowered, the emperor nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Good job. I’m proud of you for taking care of your siblings."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zantes’ brows twitched. He knew that the emperor did not go to see Arelia. To be exact, it wasn’t that he didn’t go but couldn’t. And Zantes knew this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite this, he felt his anger rise slightly at the sight of his father using Arelia as bait but said nothing. He didn't like using his younger sibling as bait in the first place.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Calming down and moving past his apology, he sat down. Then he suddenly noticed a portrait hanging on the wall of the conference room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What's that drawing?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The painting that Zantes pointed to was a sketch of Denburg that Bloody had an artist paint.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, that’s a sketch of this guy’s runaway nephew."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is that so?" Zantes looked at Denburg’s sketch curiously.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, I keep saying it doesn't look like him at all!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Pardon?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing the strange expression on Zantes’ face, William and Arcanta laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Would you like to see the sketch that Bloody painted in his likeness?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta took out a crumpled paper and showed it to Zantes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Woossi! That's really what he looks like!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zantes thought that the sketch he received was so messy that even a child could do better. He pondered how he should react.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Aren’t we here to report the results of what happened today? Let's get started." He decided to give up responding to it and avoid the subject altogether.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ignoring Bloody complaining about how the sketch truly resembled the said person, William pumped his mana into the magic circle on the table.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The magic circle on the table glowed brightly, and a three-dimensional image of the magic school floated up on the table like a hologram.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'll give the report on Operation Anthill."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William began to explain the operation. The plan used Arelia, who had the access cord, as bait to lure the Twelve Zodiacs into the magic school to arrest or kill them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"The first time we leaked information was to the individual known as&nbsp;</span><span>'Leo'</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;who wears a golden mask. Yet, it was Leo, red-masked Scorpio, and brown-masked Taurus that came to the magic school."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Scorpio and Taurus? The people whose powers we don’t fully grasp showed up?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William nodded at Arcanta's question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, although our side leaked information on purpose, it is thought that they have a formidable intelligence network."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William manipulated the magic circle to change the hologram’s video.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Atop the clock tower in the video stood Taurus and Scorpio. Due to the masks, it was not known whether they were talking or not. However, while they were facing each other, Scorpio suddenly disappeared from the video.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I believe Scorpio used invisibility magic to disappear. After this, Scorpio did not reappear."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then what about Taurus?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In response to Bloody’s question, William manipulated the magic circle again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In a different video, a slightly balding middle-aged man wearing a deep v-neck was with Taurus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s the director of the Adventurer's Guild." Zantes pointed out the middle-aged man in the video.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William nodded. "The director of the Adventurer's Guild was invited specifically for this operation.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This was off the record information William provided Zantes, the crown prince. The latter responded with a casual nod as if speaking informally was natural.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In this secret conference room, it was an unwritten rule for its occupants to be unconcerned about status.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Also, this video has sound," William said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How is that possible? Didn't you say it's much too difficult to include sound because the range of the video was so wide?" Arcanta queried.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The hologram, which filmed the entire magic school was quite a bit of work to make. However, thanks to William, it was not impossible to include audio.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, but it’s a different story if someone in the video has a recording device." William acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the video, the director of the Adventurer Guild was carrying a magic recorder. In addition, William and Bloody also had a recorder, so the conversation with Leo was included in the video.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In this video, voices could be heard.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>-</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;Hey, boy! Haven't we seen each other somewhere?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">The Adventurer Guild Director licked his lips and questioned Taurus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">- Kuhmm! You, you have the wrong person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Taurus tried to run away as if he had seen something he shouldn’t have.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">- Oh my, no way. I'm sure I've seen you with an old man wearing a blue mask. Was the old man a "Zodiac"?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">- I don’t know anything about that!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Taurus shuddered and backed away.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody and Arcanta fully empathized Taurus’s feelings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While the director was a good person, he wasn’t someone they wanted to be around. They were sure that the director’s gestures and tone were deliberately controlled to make the other person uncomfortable. They were confident of this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">- Anyways, I’m disappointed, boy! How could you have your hands in such a dirty business like kidnapping?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arcanta couldn’t figure out if the director said that because he knew that the other was part of an organization hostile to the empire.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">- Who… Who's doing something cowardly like kidnapping? I don't do anything that goes against my principles! Also, don't come any closer! If you come even one step closer, I won’t let you off!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Taurus’s voice in the video sounded somewhat frightened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">- Oh my, oh my. You won’t let me off? How naughty!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone watching the video, aside from William, felt pity for Taurus. How unfortunate it was to have gotten caught by someone like that.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The only reason William didn't pity him was simply that he couldn't understand the words of the director of Adventurer Guild.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Like a fire truck that quickly barrelled through a red light, the director approached. Disgusted, Taurus exchanged attacks quickly before fleeing and ending the fight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Taurus has not been spotted since he ran away."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor stroked his chin. He didn’t believe that Taurus was telling the truth when he said he wouldn't do anything cowardly like kidnapping. However, there was no need to pay attention to a person who had never been seen again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then that means only Leo took the bait as planned.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William nodded at the emperor. He then played a hologram video of Leo and his subordinates, explaining what had happened.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As the hologram video was playing, Zantes pointed out a person who looked hazy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why is this person showing up like this?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Zantes pointed out this anomaly, William looked perplexed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It’s likely he used magic to prevent recognition or had a magic tool with similar effects."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So you’re saying it’s not possible to know his identity?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Not really. According to Arelia, that person introduced himself as Lupin."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Lupin? Isn't that the thief who was causing a commotion in the capital until recently? Why would he be there? He couldn’t be a new member of Zodiac, could he?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William shook his head at Zantes' question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't know. That’s definitely a possibility, but there are some strange points about it.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Strange points?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Let's just keep watching for now."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They resumed the video that was paused for the question. As the scene in the video changed, Zantes freaked out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why is he flying around carrying Arelia on his back?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the midst of the dangerous attacks, Lupin carried Arelia on his back and did aerial stunts.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William calmed Zantes down and reported everything that had taken place up to the current point to the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After hearing every report, the emperor groaned and gave his review of the operation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It failed in the end.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was as the emperor said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the first place, this was a large-scale operation involving two battle race combatants recruited to kill the Twelve Zodiacs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">During the previous operation, "Spider Trap," they succeeded in killing as many as two Zodiacs but failed this time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Fortunately, Arelia was safe, and there were no losses, but a failure was still a failure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zantes hit the table, unable to hold back his anger at the emperor's sentiment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is that all you can say?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor sighed at the sight of Zantes’ rage.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Father! As bait, Arelia’s life was in danger! All you can is ‘it failed’ after seeing that video!?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Arelia knew this from the beginning."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Zantes vented his anger at the emperor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Arelia is Father's daughter, and yet!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Your Royal Highness the Crown Prince!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Arcanta's call, Zantes realized his mistake. However, his anger did not dissipate despite this realization.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Father is too cold-hearted!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He clenched his teeth and stormed out of the secret conference room.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Crown Prince!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Arcanta got up from his seat to try and catch Zantes, the emperor stopped him with a gesture.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's fine. He’s not wrong.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Shouldn’t he know how Your Majesty felt regarding this operation?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The emperor gave a bitter smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Personal feelings are useless to an emperor. He doesn't have to know."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After saying that, he became startled. Before he knew it, he was telling himself exactly what his father had said to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking back on his days as Crown Prince, he was no different from Zantes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He vented his anger at wrongdoings and didn’t hold back his words, but in the end, he still ended up saying things he never thought he would say.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>There was a bitter taste in his mouth.</span></p>
