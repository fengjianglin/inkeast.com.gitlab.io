 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Stop! What are you doing?" A sharp, high pitch voice dominated the inn’s first floor, forcing the paladins to suppress their spirits.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The unknown power in the voice seemed to restrain the paladins. As a woman descended from the stairs, the paladins knelt on one knee in unison to show their respect.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was the person they admired, Saintess Hillis.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis passed by the kneeling paladins and approached Lancelot's party situated in the middle of the first floor.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Lady Saintess! It's dangerous!" A paladin objected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Be quiet!" The saintess said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once again, the Knights were unable to lift their heads as if a strong pressure was being exerted on them.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The saintess approached Mac and bowed her head to apologize, "My subordinates have been rude."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In Hillis’s eyes, it seemed like her subordinates had surrounded innocent civilians and threatened them, but rather, Mac had deliberately lightly provoked the paladins’ subconscious without anyone knowing. However, since the paladins remained unaware, there was no way that Hillis could have known, having come down late.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Hillis bowed and apologized, the men groaned indignantly. They blamed themselves more than anyone else for making the honorable saintess bow her head, but they were bound by Hillis's orders and couldn't open their mouths.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac licked his lips at the change in the situation. In reality, it was better not to get in a fight as one of the group’s escorts, but he couldn't help but feel some regret.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I don't understand what's going on, so can you explain the situation to me?" Hillis enquired while tenderly smiling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac shrugged and gave Lancelot's back a slight push. "I'm just an escort. The leader of our party should answer such a difficult question.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Vice-captain?" Hillis pressed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly pushed forward, Lancelot looked at Mac in surprise, but Mac just returned a handsome smile. Lancelot wanted to ask why he should deal with a situation he didn’t cause, but he couldn't vent his feelings at this moment.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot stopped himself from acting when he recalled Denburg’s teachings. If the other party didn’t notice your own side’s faults and apologized, there was no need to tell them about your faults.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since the situation was already like this, he decided to be confident. Either way, their level seemed to be too insufficient to notice Mac's provocation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"That’s, maybe we could stay at the inn too,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic">heuk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!" Lancelot looked at Hillis with tearful eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was Denburg’s wise saying that those who cry first survive for sure. As a tear slid down Lancelot's cheek, Hillis understood everything that Lancelot wanted to say.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When they were forced to beg for a room and unable to stay because the inn was fully rented, the paladins tried to chase them away by raising their fighting spirits to the point where the inn was shaking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Her understanding wasn’t necessarily wrong. Even the innkeeper who was watching the whole situation felt the same way.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reality was a little different, but it became true with Lancelot's performance. Lancelot's innocent-looking eyes were convincing enough to fool even Hillis, who was used to dealing with the old raccoons at the temple.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Do you guys have anything to say?" Hillis asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The paladins had nothing to say in response to Hillis's rage. To be specific, they were bound by the previous order of "Be quiet" and couldn't open their mouths.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the lack of any response, Hillis admonished the paladins with cold eyes, "You all are priests. Of course, I know that it is your job to wield the sword, to become the shield of God, and to crush God’s enemies, but before that, a priest must share God's mercy. Yet, persecuting the innocent, do you think that's what you should do as a priest?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, the paladins could not answer. Hillis continued to preach without caring.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Have you ever thought that each of your acts could dirty God's name? The poor, the rich, the noble, and the wicked are equal before God. As the saintess, I am disappointed by this display. So-"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis, who finished speaking like a squadron leader, took a deep breath and shouted, "Drop your heads, you bastards!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Hillis's command, the paladins responded perfectly and put their heads on the ground, holding their hands behind their backs. <span id="footnote-ref-5edb"><a href="#footnote-5edb">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sight made Lancelot flustered, "Uh, um, that might be a little excessive...”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at the paladins’ veins bulging out of their necks and their heads supporting their body weight, Lancelot asked Hillis for leniency.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the very least, Lancelot had originally intended to get Leisha to be able to stay in the inn, not have the paladins be violently punished.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, this is a trial from God. You don't have to worry too much about it," Hillis stated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">No, it's not God. This is your trial, isn't it?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot thought so, but he couldn't state his innermost feelings when he saw Hillis's benevolent yet refreshing smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis continued while sitting gently on the back of the nearest knight. "I haven’t introduced myself yet. I'm Hillis and am known in the temple as a saintess, undeservingly. I’m associated with the Great Temple Percival.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Um, excuse me. Isn’t that too heavy for him?” Lancelot asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Lancelot stated his concern for the paladin lying under Hillis, she looked shocked. "Oh, my! Do I look so heavy?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, that’s not it," Lancelot said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis smiled at the bewildered Lancelot. Then she patted the back of the knight she was on and asked, "Am I heavy?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The knight almost answered "Yes!" at that moment, but fortunately, he was still bound by the order "Be quiet" and could not answer.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When there was no answer, Hillis frowned for a while then realized that he could not answer because she had previously issued an order with divine power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Answer! Am I heavy?” Hillis asked again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon the repeated order, the knight replied with a roar, "No! Miss Saintess is as light as a feather!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">What Hillis ordered was to answer, not tell the truth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis looked at Lancelot again and smiled, "So he says. Now, can you tell me who you are?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot realized that he had not introduced himself and began to speak, "Oh! I apologize. I'm Lancelot from the 3rd team of the Crow Tribe’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I was dispatched as a special envoy to the capital. I've heard much about Miss Saintess through rumors."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot was quick to greet the saintess as he was trained at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis couldn’t help but be surprised at Lancelot's greeting. Aside from Bloody, who was the head of the Imperial Army, the Crows were closed off to the outside world, with the only external dealings being selling demon byproducts in Warrant.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was inconceivable that they would meet each other in Zaharam, so far from Olympus Forest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As per the rumors, he really had black hair and black eyes. The black hair was more common, but she had never seen black eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I didn't expect rumors about me to spread even to the Crows. It's an honor." Hillis said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, even our village and military chiefs were interested to hear about the saintess. After all, one hasn’t been selected since more than 80 years ago."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eight years ago, on the day of her 10th birthday, Hillis received divine revelation and became a saintess.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The birth of a new saint came 80 years after the death of the former saint, so it had actually been 130 years after their death that a new saint was chosen. It became such a big event that Hillis’ existence became known throughout the Empire and even the world.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Then are those people Crows, too?" Hillis asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Lancelot nodded, "Yes, the one holding a magic wand over there is Leisha Blade. She's the daughter of&nbsp;</span><span>Doomstone</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Blade, known outside as the village chief.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis was surprised to hear that Leisha was Doomstone's daughter.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ah! That legend!" Hillis exclaimed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The legend of Doomstone, in which he had blown half a kingdom away, was still being talked about.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was mainly used to tell crying children that Doomstone would come after them if they didn’t stop crying. In fact, some people considered Doomstone to be a legendary beast or dragon rather than a real-life person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis also heard about him a lot from her older sister, Vibrio, when they stayed up late at night when she was young.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How unexpected. I thought her daughter would be, how do you say, very muscular, but she's so slender. Not to mention that she is a magician also."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was hard to imagine that there were magicians among the Crows, but contrary to what she thought, there were many magicians in the Crow Tribe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although the number was small compared to the Butterfly Tribe, more than half of the village could use basic magic. The percentage of magicians who specialize in magical research was also several times higher than that of the Empire and other kingdoms. Of course, most of them could only use magic at the level of being able to produce light as bright as a flashlight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the first place, the image that the Crows were unfamiliar with magic was not only because of Olympus Forest’s environment but also because of Doomstone and Bloody. Although Doomstone traveled outside the village only for a short period, he was able to achieve things that couldn’t even be done with strong magic using his bare hands.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Bloody was also frequently unfriendly towards magic users, which gave the impression that the Crows were not amiable to the field of magic.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leisha waved at Hillis. "Only one of my brothers is as strong as my father. The other brothers are normal."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Come to think of it, the youngest son is even slimmer than Miss,” Mac said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot became furious at Mac, "No! Den’s figure is! His figure... it's not thick, but wouldn't it be slimmer than Leisha noona?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot couldn't say that Den had a thick figure.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Wait! My figure is thicker than Den’s?! Lancelot! You have to be truthful!" Leisha suddenly felt insulted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Even if it was true, it was hard to ignore someone saying she had a thicker figure than a boy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot ignored the teary Leisha and gave a fake cough as he introduced Mac to Hillis. "Hmmhmm! This is the vice-captain of the warrior corps, one of the main armed groups of the Crows."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I’m Mac,” Mac said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Nice to meet you," Hillis replied with a smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking past Hillis’s graceful smile, Lancelot asked for leniency once again when he saw that the paladins still had their heads on the ground, sweating profusely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Isn’t it okay to stop now?” Lancelot asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Seeing that his tactic of crying first to survive ended up in this scenario, he felt uncomfortable, as he felt that it was all his fault.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Lancelot's request, Hillis shook her head. "No, they persecuted innocent people. As long as you serve me, if you've done something wrong, you need to be punished."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Even so, we are Crows and didn't feel threatened.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The sight of Lancelot persistently persuading Hillis moved the paladins and made them feel guilty at the same time. It was because Hillis's point was not wrong, even though they were unknowingly provoked into attacking.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"However, did you all reveal that you were Crows first?” Hillis asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot wanted to say yes, but looking at Hillis's eyes, he felt that he couldn’t lie.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lancelot was forced to remain silent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If you didn't reveal it first, they were just trying to intimidate innocent people. More than anything else, even if they knew, they shouldn’t have raised their fighting spirits to that extent."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis was adamant. The innkeeper was holding his breath in a corner when Hillis approached him. The innkeeper was still shaking from the paladin’s fighting spirits. The power of the paladins was too much for an ordinary innkeeper, and he was swept away by it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's easy for those with strong powers to forget about their surroundings, but it’s fine."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hillis hugged the innkeeper. She rubbed his back and released warm energy from her hand to calm the innkeeper, who had been shaking as if he had malaria.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Everyone on the first floor of the inn was aware of the innkeeper but just realized that they had ignored him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The touch of Hillis was very pious and pensive and warm.</span></p>
