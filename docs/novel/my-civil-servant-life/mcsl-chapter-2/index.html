 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I don’t have much interest in camping.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hmm—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My father thought for a while then finally said, “Well then, how about following my path and becoming the village head?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“—Excuse me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, I thought I misheard that he wanted me to become the village head.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">God, isn’t it already known that my father would never say such a thing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Eldest Brother once wielded his adamantium axe and attacked Father while shouting, “Father, I am succeeding the throne!” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In response, Father casually repelled the attack with his bare hands and said, “Son, I’m still young!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“What’s with that stupid look on your face? I want you to take over.” Father sullenly reiterated.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Father, what kind of nonsense is this?” I dumbfoundedly asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“It’s not nonsense.” He calmly answered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No. It is nonsense.” I reaffirmed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was very possible that my father’s iron hands would be immediately foisting upon me if I spoke disrespectfully like this. Unfortunately, what had to be said had to be said.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I’m weaker than Eldest Brother and worse at swordsmanship than Second Eldest Brother. Isn’t this village a place where strength is everything?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, rather than foisting his iron first, he simply let out a small sigh. “But, amongst all the villagers, you are the best at magic.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was taken aback by his words. “Ever since I started learning magic, you told me that magic is just a small trick!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From the very beginning, my father had opposed my interest in magic. He would often say that it was a petty trick for weak people.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes, I did say that and it is what I still believe. However, the magic you perform is not just some small tricks.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I couldn't comprehend my father’s words. It was like he was saying that driving after drinking wasn’t considered drunk driving.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No small tricks in this world can defeat a dragon. If a small trick could defeat a dragon, it can’t be considered a small trick anymore.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I was at a loss, I didn’t know what to say to those words.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Even if you are lacking in strength compared to your eldest brother, amongst the villagers, you are still one of the top. More so for swordsmanship. If you are right below your second eldest brother in this village, then you are considered the second best.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, not really.” I waved my hand and denied it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But he laughed and said, “Your second eldest brother, the best swordsman in the village, said that when he takes a day off, you catch up by two days. He has to do three days worth of training every day to continue maintaining the distance.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I pursed my lips.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Your second eldest sister taught you magic, she told me that you are the best magician in the village. Elder Mirpa, who is officially recognized as the number one magician in the village, also concurred. Also, your eldest sister, the one I always seek out for advice, said that your depth of knowledge is either at the same or higher level than hers. She told me that if I need advice, it would be helpful to ask you as well.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The look on his face was asking if I would still deny his words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Seeing how resolute you are, it looks like you’ve already been considering making me succeed as the village head. Since when did you decide?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ever since you defeated that dragon.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, he had decided that I would be his successor since I was 12.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Eldest Brother and Second Eldest Brother defeated dragons as well. So, why me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To my father, being good at magic or being highly educated was only secondary. If I had to make a comparison, it was equivalent to writing down a second-degree certificate in Korean history or Chinese language on the resume for a large company. It was a level of achievement that was too subtle to distinguish me from other candidates.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your eldest and second eldest brother did not catch it alone. They did so with two or three companions. In addition,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">when your brothers were twelve, they couldn’t even catch demons, let alone a dragon.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Instead, they were busy fleeing. Hahaha, it’s funny even as I think about it now. Hahahaha!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">My father banged his desk as he laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">I could suddenly empathize with my eldest and second eldest brother for launching a sneak attack against my father before their coming of age ceremony.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Should I just launch an attack now as well?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I felt the urge to attack as I recalled the memory of being tossed down into the dragon’s den. However, doing so would just end with me suffering in bed for a few days after being thrown around excitedly by that muscle-monster.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s why you can’t go to the empire. You have to succeed after me,” Father firmly said then added, “Well, I’m still in my prime and you’re too young for the position for now. I’ll pass it on to you when you get older.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes. I understand. I will start heading out then.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With a smile, I said goodbye and left the office.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While walking back home, I saw a child in a vacant lot. He looked to be about ten. He was holding a sword and attacking an old man, seemingly his grandfather. The child’s grandfather blocked the sword lightly with his fingers that were shrouded in sword aura. The old man seemed to be enjoying his grandson’s antics.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Shit!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this rate, it seemed like I was about to become the chief of a tribe of battle crazy fighters.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The chief of a tribe was not a position that a normal person like me should inherit. I had ideally wanted to leave this village with a smile on my face. Unfortunately, there was nothing I could do about it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was time for plan B.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone Blade, Chief of Crow Tribe, one of the battle races, laughed as he recalled the event that happened yesterday. His youngest son, Denburg Blade, had come in as he was about to become an adult. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unfortunately, unlike his other sons, Denburg did not launch a sneak attack or attack him. Still, it was remarkable that his youngest son, his dearest child, had come in to pay him a visit as an adult.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, Doomstone had been taken aback when Denburg had said that he wanted to leave the village. Fortunately, he was pleased that the latter had left with a smile on his face as if to say that his son had understood his feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">To be honest, Doomstone had been planning on letting Denburg know about inheriting his position when he was a bit older. Still, since he was now almost sixteen, he reckoned it would be fine to let him know.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As such, Doomstone announced to his family over dinner last evening. Although he had not expressed it, he had felt a bit nervous over their responses. Fortunately, it turned out to be needless worrying.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His sons and daughters also approved of Denburg inheriting the position. Disregarding his daughters, the youngest son, and the second eldest son who had no aspirations for the position, he had been a bit surprised that his eldest son had also agreed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“I saw Father going through a pile of documents a while back and it made my head hurt. Youngest Brother can be the greatest ruler and I can be the greatest warrior!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Feeling proud of his eldest son, Doomstone gave him a headlock and patted his head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“My sons and daughters! Give me a hug!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Doomstone opened his arm, Hestia, the eldest daughter yelled, “Everyone run away!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With this warning, his two sons and daughters simultaneously ran away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Hmm.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;He murmured that this was going to hurt his feelings. As he spoke, Doomstone asked his eldest son who was trapped by the headlock and unable to run away, “Don’t you think so too?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Yes! Of ...Of course! But father, how about you let me go—” Gallahad, his eldest son, asked while pushing his arms but Doomstone had no intention of letting him go.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Wait? Dad? DAD!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As Doomstone’s chest came closer and the pressure from his arms strengthened, Gallahad started yelling frantically at his father.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Yes, Father loves you too.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: center"><span style="font-weight: 400">-o-</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Village Head!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone woke up from his reverie of the happenings of the previous day as he heard someone calling out to him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His receptionist standing next to him whispered in his ear as he shook away his musings.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Village Head, I have summoned the elders according to your instructions.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Without him realizing, the room was now filled with old muscle men who called themselves the elders.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Ahh, I am sorry. I apologize for being away in thought.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“To think that you would know how to think. I am proud.” Upon Doomstone’s apology, Elder Mirpa, the only elder in the room without any bulging muscles, teased him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“That’s so mean of you to say. I’m also getting older and have been working hard lately. Additionally, I’m still technically the village head. You can’t just address me informally like that.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“So noisy. Just tell us why you summoned us all. Based on how you called all the elders and not just me, it looks like you have something important to say.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The most gentleman-like Elder Wager also added as if he was curious: “Yes, Tribe Chief. Tell us why you summoned us. You know as well that you become more impatient as you get old.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Haha, Tribe Chief? Just call me Village Head rather than using such outdated names.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The elders kept calling him tribe chief as if the other title was foreign to them. As trade with the empire increased, Hestia had suggested that the title tribe chief be replaced with village head. But it was clear that the title village head did not seem very impressive.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As per Denburg’s suggestion, Doomstone considered changing his title from the village head to something more invigorating such as “Fire Shadow”.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Tribe Chief or Village Head, stop changing the topic and get to the point.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon Elder Mirpa’s continuous nagging, Doomstone lightly said, “I called everyone because I've decided on the next person to become the village head.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The elders were silent at first but then started talking&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">amongst themselves</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Are you sick somewhere? Do you have some disease I’m not aware of?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon Elder Mirpa’s questions, the other elders became worried and stared at Doomstone.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“No, I’m fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then why is a fine person already talking about appointing the next village head! Why are you saying something like that!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The volume in the room grew louder as the elders started yelling.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Everyone shut up!” Suddenly, Elder Mirpa exploded and the room instantly quieted.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Once the room had regained silence, Elder Mirpa stared right into Doomstone’s eyes and asked, “Okay. Let’s ignore for now why a perfectly fine person like you is already deciding on the next village head. Who is the successor? You eldest son? Second eldest son?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone shook his head. “It’s the youngest son.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The chattering started again. Elder Mirpa glanced back and forth to shut them up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As he watched this scene in front of him, Doomstone became slightly depressed as he imagined his future.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although every elder here used to be loud and vigorous, their age had weakened their muscle and deteriorated their abilities. As a magician, Elder Mirpa was the sole exception to this rule since his magic power grew with age.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">During his youth, people had looked down on Elder Mirpa for learning magic instead of swordsmanship or martial arts. But those same people became helpless against him as they grew older and went past their middle age.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As Doomstone was considering learning magic from Denburg, Elder Mirpa said, “It’s fine if your youngest son becomes the next tribe chief. Unlike yourself,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Den is</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;wise and smart. Also, it’s not unheard of for the youngest son to become the tribe chief.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In contrast to the outside world where the throne was succeeded by the eldest son, past village heads, no tribe chiefs, were chosen based on strength. Therefore, the youngest sons also had the chance of becoming a tribe chief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The occasional female tribe chiefs were also due to this.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“But why your youngest son?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elder Mirpa was not asking why the youngest son Denburg had been chosen over the eldest son. Rather because Doomstone considered magic as petty tricks. In other words, he was asking the latter why he would choose someone who specialized in magic as well as whether Denburg had superior strength compared to his other brothers.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There was only one answer to the question.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Because he is the strongest. Could there be any other reason?”</span></p>
