 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Speaking of the Butterfly Tribe, I’ve suddenly started to become interested, but my peaceful life came first. Also, I didn't think he'd tell me even if I asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How was the entrance ceremony, Alphonso?” Yuria asked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Alphonso nodded at her. "Yes! Ta-da! I got this." He took a small case out of his pocket and showed it to his sister.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Inside the case was a metal epaulet that would be attached to the uniform shoulder. It was shaped like a small hexagonal star on a bent stick. Although the hierarchy of the imperial army and the former life was not the same, that pattern was probably around sergeant major.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Lisbon didn’t show it, he would have received a similar epaulet. Middle-rank knight school was considered higher than Alphonso’s, but they were of similar rank. But since they had both become sergeant majors, they seemed very old.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You finally took your first step as a knight. Congratulations, Alphonso."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As William clapped his hands and congratulated him, Alphonso scratched the back of his head embarrassed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hehehe, thank you, Uncle."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Come to think of it, Alphonso’s future was solid. His uncle, his guardian in the capital, was also one of the top people in the military. The boy could even say something like, "Are you the Command Sergeant Major around here?" after being commissioned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If he made the best use of this opportunity, he could even aim for a fast track to promotions. It was possible enough because the empire was like a feudal state from an old era, not a democratic one. Moreover, it seemed like common sense now after hanging around my uncle, but I didn’t think he would be forced to go to the Demon’s Territory either.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It would have been nice if my uncle had the common sense of ordinary people like me, not of the Crow Tribe. That's really too bad.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Firstly, since their gazes didn’t seem to have come towards me yet, I was going to sneak away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But what about him over there?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Dang, too late!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William asked while pointing at me and Alphonso responded in a bright voice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, he is my friend!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn't want to stand out as much as possible, but if I ran away without saying hello, I'd stand out even more. So I decided to say hello.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hello, I'm Den von Mark."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-weight: 400">—</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Den?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William looked suspicious. Judging by that reaction, it was safe to say that news about me had already entered the palace.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When I was looking to rob some exam papers, considering how I didn’t see any documents in the palace regarding how to cope with me from when I was running amok, the number of people who knew of my escape was very few.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I can roughly think of two reasons why my escape was kept a secret. One, to prevent chaos. Considering what my father did when he was young, there must be more than a group of people that would panic over the escape of his chosen successor. Two, so as to not provoke me hastily. If they suddenly put my name and description on the wanted list, they didn’t know what I might do, so they were staying still just in case. This was based on the logic that there's no need to poke the beehive that stays still.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm staying at the same boarding house as Alphonso and Yuria."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was only now that William relaxed his suspicion, smiled, and shook hands with me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Nice to meet you. My name is William. Their uncle. Thanks for getting along with Alphonso.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Unexpectedly, it was a casual greeting. It wouldn't be strange if I thought of my hometown where formalities took a backseat.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I lowered my head slightly and returned the greeting as I shook hands. "It's an honor to meet the famous General William."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I had to shake hands at eye level because of the slightly high window between us. He probably wouldn't think that I would be staying at the prime minister’s mother, Mrs. Arscilla's, boarding house as it was darkest under the lamp. He would not have gone to such a place where they checked identities and was under surveillance if he was in his right mind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But that didn't mean I was out of my mind. Let's use the image of the martial fanatic Crow Tribe, and speak educatedly to make them think I am not Denburg.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As a measure for such scenarios, I had dyed my hair a common color- dark brown. However, the eyes were left black because there was no way to dye them other than magic. Usually, the color was just dyed by magic, but the opponent was from the Butterfly Tribe, so the use of magic had to be avoided.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You don't have to speak so stiffly. A friend of my niece and nephew is no different from being my nephew."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William smiled brightly saying something similar to what Flam had told Alphonso. Indeed, like a member of Alphonso and Yuria's family, he had a similar smile.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Den, Alphonso, what are you doing over there?" Lisbon and Flam approached from behind and asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They seemed to have followed after us who disappeared without a word.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William looked at the two that followed and asked his nephew, "What about those people?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"My friends!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William patted Alphonso's head seemingly slightly moved. "Hi! I'm his uncle. Please continue to be good friends with our Alphonso."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Lisbon reflexively greeted back courteously. "Yes, hello. My name is Lisbon von Carter."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then after a brief delay like booting up an old computer, he seemed surprised.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He must have remembered who Alphonso's uncle was.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Hey, your reaction is slow!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Flam did not seem to care, perhaps because he couldn’t have known Alphonso’s origin since they had just met. It was common knowledge that the Butterfly Tribe were white-haired, but it wasn't like there were a lot of people from the battle races around. So you wouldn't necessarily think that the person next to you was from a battle race.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hahaha, nice to meet you. If you're an uncle of a friend, you're also an uncle to me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>I haven't known Flam for a long time, but it was&nbsp;</span><span>a first</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span>seeing</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;such a madman.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Do you know who you are speaking like that to? You wouldn’t know. If you knew, you wouldn't have spoken like that.<span id="footnote-ref-6f1c"><a href="#footnote-6f1c">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>But if he didn’t speak like that, I wonder if he would seem less like that cartoon penguin in glasses.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;Although if you looked just at his size, he was more of a polar bear than a penguin.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thanks for thinking so." William didn’t mind Flam’s mannerism and spoke back casually.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Or maybe he didn’t mind since Flam looked old. One win for looking old!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It's fate that we met like this, so come in and I'll buy you a meal."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Under normal circumstances, unless you were a pushover, you’d decline. But his body was slightly frozen.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was another first, seeing Lisbon like this. Right after starting his military trainee life, he had met a star that could fulfill his dreams, but somehow it still felt strange to go sit.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm also curious as to who is the one that made Yuria giggle.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Uncle!" Yuria blushed and struck William in the ribs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span>Woook</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William groaned and collapsed when he was hit by a blow empowered by magic that would not have ended with just internal organ rupture if it had been an ordinary person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Hey, um. Are. you. O. K.?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">There's no answer. It's like a normal corpse.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hohoho, gosh Uncle, don’t exaggerate."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Though she was hidden by the window, Yuria laughed and tapped William with her foot to get up quickly. I didn't think he was being dramatic. Yuria's blow just now was skillful enough to make even the Crow Tribe have difficulty getting up if hit defenselessly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As it had been until now, I should continue to not mess around with Yuria.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ugh—"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">William got up groaning. He gave a money pouch to Yuria with a pale face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I've got some work to do. I’ll leave... first... Use this to buy food."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His breathing was unnatural. Maybe he thought he might end up a corpse if he kept messing around, but William ran away leaving the money behind.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Is this how you gain money when you get rid of monsters in a game?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">We all went to the restaurant and had lunch with the money Yuria looted.</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">From atop a huge castle located on the outskirts of the capital, a gray-haired old man with a golden mask and a burly-looking man with a brown mask were looking at the capital below.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Doesn’t it seem futile? Leo." The man in the brown mask called Taurus sighed as darkness slowly encroached the capital.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The old man in the golden mask, Leo, had a bitter smile. "It seems futile. Yes, it might be futile." He then jumped&nbsp;</span><span>lightly</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;upon the outer wall of the castle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"But you know, Taurus." Leo looked back at Taurus and laughed greedily.&nbsp;</span><span>"Would it matter if you could hold all this in the palm of your hands?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Just like the other, Taurus climbed up the outer wall of the castle and said, "To hold everything in your grasp, that’s greedy, Leo." He sat on the edge in the direction of the capital. Then he added,&nbsp;</span><span>"That sounded like something Scorpio would say."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leo broke into a frenzied laughter. "Ahahahahaha!!” Then he stopped and made a serious face. "Are you crazy? How dare you compare that woman who’s full of greed to me!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Taurus smiled indifferently at the other's outburst. "So stay in line, Leo. Right now, you look like you have fallen into the greed you despise."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leo snorted. "That’s not even funny. Stay in line. Does the empire look easy to you?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, the empire is mighty. More than anything in the world."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But still, stay in line?” Leo asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Taurus nodded.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You are a fool. You are the one who wants the destruction of the empire more than anyone else." Leo spoke out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I can't help it if it's foolish. It’s my belief."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Leo sighed. He looked so foolish, but he also liked the simplicity and naivety of Taurus.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You foolish person. I don't want to become enemies with you. Don't interfere with my work."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Saying so, Leo jumped down the castle wall. Taurus muttered as he looked towards where the other disappeared, hidden by the darkness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I will do so if my principles permit."</span></p>

 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Today was the day of the first class at the training center.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Upon arriving, I headed to the vacant lot inside the school as per schedule. According to the one I’d signed up for, the first class at the training center was swordsmanship.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The guidebook stated that all the tools needed for the class were to be prepared by the training center, so there was no need to bring a sword. All the weapons that lay in my pocket space were made of super rare metals such as mithril, orichalcum, and adamantium. Moreover, for the sake of magic practice, I had engraved magic into them, so it was overkill to use for class. I had been considering buying a cheap one at a nearby weapon store, but that was a relief.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Arriving at the vacant lot, the first thing I noticed was the overwhelmingly old-looking Flam.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That face was my age... It felt like a supporting actor in his 30s, wearing a uniform and playing the role of a teenager in a drama.</span></p>
