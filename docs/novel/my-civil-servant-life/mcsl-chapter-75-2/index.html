 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac advanced on foot and swung his sword. The camel that he was riding lost its life from an enemy soldier’s spear. Mac had never run in the sand before, and his ride was faster than him, so he felt disappointed that he lost his ride.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The leader of the paladins,&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, had also lost his camel and felt sorry for Mac. Albatoss prayed that the camel, whose body was still warm, would go into God's arms and become another companion for his camel.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The bastards who sold their souls to the black magicians could not go to God's side, but since God also made hell, he thought he could at least land in between the two.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What are you doing? There are only five enemies! Overwhelm them!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Despite the commander's orders, the soldiers faltered. The momentum of the five soldiers who had broken through seemed to increase rather than decrease.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>"</span><span style="font-style: italic">Keuk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! Do these bastards not get tired?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The paladins were healed in an instant each time the spearmen injured them. It was like a healing power akin to the trolls, which were rare to encounter even in the monster paradise, Mount Alps. No, if anything, this healing ability was greater than a troll, not less.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Cockroach bastards."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was just 20 minutes since the battle started, but those five had already killed 60 soldiers. No, perhaps it was better to say that fewer enemies had died than expected. After all, they were paladins receiving the saintess’s blessing.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reason for this lower death count was simple. The corpses of those who had died after taking the power potion were controlled with black magic and used as shields against the enemy. If their goal was to stall for time with these ordinary soldiers, you could say that they were used effectively.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Comforting himself with these thoughts, the commander looked up at the sky. It was already evening when the fighting began, but now the sun was setting.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Do we have to deal with those monsters in the dark?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>This prospect frightened the commander</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. Even if it were completely dark around them, the paladins would be able to see as if it were daytime with Hillis’s blessing. To even the playing field, he wondered if his army’s magicians would be able to cast the same magic on each and every soldier. At that moment, a thought flashed through the commander's head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">If it is impossible to cast magic on each soldier, then can’t the entire battlefield be lit up?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Go back and ask the magicians to use light magic.” The commander ordered, sending his deputy to the rear.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The reason that this was a request and not an order was because the magicians at the rear were not under his command. Though his command didn’t extend over them, he was still technically their superior.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Looking at the red-colored sky, the commander waited for the light to rise quickly. However, by the time the sun was almost behind the sandhills, no artificial light had risen. Towards the peak of the commander’s restlessness, the deputy sent as a messenger returned in a hurry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Battalion, battalion commander. They say they won't use magic!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What the f*ck?!" At the absurdity of his deputy’s reply, the commander let out a torrent of curses.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's, we need magic to keep that magician with the saintess in check…”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"F*ck! Are those words or farts! If those cockroaches break through right now, the magicians will be dead first!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The deputy was startled by his superior’s anger.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Fire! Light all the torches!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ye, yes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The new order spurred any soldiers with free hands into immediately lighting the torches. No matter how many torches were lit, the number of prepared torches was limited, so it would be impossible to make the battlefield as bright as daytime. However, just being able to secure the soldiers’ vision was enough.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Damn it, if only Captain Malecia were here!” The commander gnashed his teeth.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If there were at least one person who could deal with those charging men trying to kill the black magicians, he would be able to send the free soldiers to where the saintess was. However, if some of the troops were repositioned right now, this area would be breached.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Right now, he wanted to pull out his sword and fight the paladins, but as the commander, he could not act rashly. If it were a duel instead, he would have stepped up right away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that moment, a torchlight appeared in the darkness of the desert far away. Then the torchlight began running towards them. The commander panicked, assuming that it was more paladins arriving as reinforcements. Next to the torchbearer was a flag bearer on a camel. Seeing the flag’s insignia, the commander felt a feeling of hot emotion dominating his whole body.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Open the way! It is Captain Malecia!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The soldiers cheered at the commander's cry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Open the way!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">* * *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia quickly rode his camel and rushed in between the soldiers. Fortunately, the soldiers also saw the flag and quickly opened the way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>In an instant, when he arrived near the paladins amongst the soldiers, he jumped off the camel and attacked. The paladin who received&nbsp;</span><span>Malecia's</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;dark red sword aura felt his foot sink into the sand from the strong impact.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The paladin felt his wrist go numb and groaned. "</span><span style="font-style: italic">Keuk</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia landed easily, heading for the temporarily stunned paladin. He stabbed his sword into the gap in the paladin’s right shoulder. He planned to cut off the paladin’s right arm and create a weakness for the enemy. The saintess could reattach a severed arm, but regrowing it would be near impossible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At that time, a sword struck Malecia's from the bottom and pushed it up, making his sword just slightly cut the paladin’s shoulder rather than chopping it off completely.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The paladin screamed at the pain coming from his bleeding shoulder. "</span><span style="font-style: italic">Kuaaak</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, a white holy light soon healed the paladin's shoulder. Malecia became speechless at the sight of this healing. With this, he could understand why the troops were struggling against just five people.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank, thank you, Mac." The paladin’s pain had not dissipated, and he had cold sweat running down his body, but he still thanked Mac.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac pointed his sword at Malecia and said, “You can just buy me a beer later.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Then I'll buy you a whole barrel!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Mac had a playful attitude, the power felt from his sword made Malecia realize that he was not ordinary.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh! You’re a strong person. Who are you?" Mac asked playfully, but he remained vigilant of the turban-wearing men surrounding him and the paladins.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It hadn’t been long since Mac left Olympus, but Malecia was the strongest person he had encountered so far. One-on-one, he was confident of his victory, but it would not be easy in a group setting with paladins he had never fought with before.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Mac's wariness, Malecia laughed, "It seems I still have a long way to go if I am being asked who I am.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It wasn't an answer to Mac's question, but ironically, it was a paladin who ended up introducing Malecia.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Black Knight Malecia!”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“The Mercenary King!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At the paladin’s shout, the soldiers surrounding them erupted in cheers. It was a cheer formed from both the pride and relief that such a strong man was on their side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Well dang, to hear the words ‘Mercenary King’ from an Empire citizen, what an event.” Although Malecia said this, he enjoyed the title of mercenary king.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Usually, the term "Mercenary King" in the Empire was used to refer to the leader of the current mercenary alliance. As such, someone being called the Mercenary King by an Empire citizen was no different from being recognized as having great skill. It was all the more notable because it was a title earned through a war with the Empire as an enemy.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Since this isn’t a war started by my own will, I would like to be called Black Knight rather than the Mercenary King,” Malecia requested.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What does a title matter? Let's cross swords,” Mac said, feeling his hands itch as he formed his martial aura.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Good!" Malecia shouted and went on to strike first. At the same time, Malecia's men and the paladins began their battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Malecia's sword aura headed for&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss, who</span><span>&nbsp;received&nbsp;</span><span>Malecia’s</span><span>&nbsp;sword with hardened eyes. Against&nbsp;</span><span>Malecia's</span><span>&nbsp;pressuring blade,&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;tried to push back with the help of Hillis’s divine power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">During this exchange, a turbaned man went after the back of Albatoss's neck, saying, "Ahuh! Play with me too!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Mac threw the broken spear that was by his feet and saved&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">. The turbaned man aiming for Albatoss's neck almost dropped his sword from the powerful impact of the spear that appeared to have been lightly thrown.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Malecia let&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss</span><span>&nbsp;go and retreated before his sword became filled with Hillis’s power, following which two turbaned men naturally attached themselves to the paladins’ leader.&nbsp;</span><span>Albatoss</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;had no choice but to give his full attention to the constant barrage of swords, left with no opportunity to thank Mac.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac didn't miss that opportunity and swung his sword at Malecia, aiming for his heart. The captain blocked Mac's sword using his own. No, he thought he blocked it. He judged that such a sharp sword that was as cruel as it was accurate should not be blocked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">They both began thinking at the same time.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">This blow resembled the blow that killed his subordinates who were transporting the luggage. After this thought entered his mind, Malecia realized that this was the killer he was looking for.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia quickly filled his sword with mana and rotated it. Mac's sword was turned upwards by Malecia's mana, and Malecia just barely managed to dodge the sword aimed for his heart by twisting his body. Unfortunately, the sword that he used to create the gap broke into two pieces.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Sword!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>A soldier threw the sword that he was holding at Malecia’s shout. Mac instantly struck at the sword flying towards them instead of striking at&nbsp;</span><span>Malecia’s</span><span>&nbsp;life. Immediately after striking the sword, Malecia threw the broken half-sword without hesitation at Mac. Either way,&nbsp;</span><span>Malecia’s</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;head would have been sent flying the moment he was about to receive the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac deflected the broken half-sword that flew straight at his neck. Malecia did not use the gap to attack but rather to escape from his position. It was a wise decision.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>Mac's reaction speed was well ahead of&nbsp;</span><span>Malecia's</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;expectation. It would be hard to kill Mac, even if he and all of his men rushed him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">He wanted to kill Mac rather than the paladins, but even when his troops outnumbered the enemy, they were just barely maintaining an even match against the paladins strengthened by the saintess’s power.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">No matter how strengthened the paladins became with Hillis’s support, they were not used to handling that power and became unsteady, creating gaps. Thanks to this, Malecia’s men alone were somehow able to match the paladins, but Mac was a monster that could disrupt the balance of the battle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In other words, Malecia had to deal with Mac by himself in order to maintain the current situation in the confrontation.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'm going to go crazy."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Malecia thought that this place might unexpectedly become his grave.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Slightly distancing him from the battlefield with a laugh, Malecia stole the spears of the soldiers around him and threw them at Mac.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Don't mind me, shoot arrows at him!".After saying this, Malecia approached Mac again.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander paused for a moment before preparing the archers to shoot. "If possible, aim only at the enemy."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But Captain Malecia might get hit," one of the archers pointed out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"...Just believe, as I will too."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The archers nodded at the commander's stern look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Of the archers constantly firing arrows at the Hillis’s carriage, some changed their target.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Deputy, covertly prepare to retreat.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The deputy nodded at the commander.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The chances were slim, but in the case that the paladins guarding Hillis came over, it would be foolhardy to have the soldiers confront them. Moreover, it was also necessary to consider the possibility that the rest of the saintess’s guards were on the way. If so, it would be safer to go back to the Holy Land Zaharam and hold the fort. At least there, the soldiers would have full visibility.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The commander quietly watched the scene of the paladins and his turbaned men in a desperate struggle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hitting the flying arrows with his sword, Mac burst out laughing for a long time. "Ahahahaha!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Mac deflected Malecia’s sword that was rushing towards his throat. As Mac was about to cut downwards, an arrow flew towards him from another direction. Malecia also occasionally had to avoid the arrows shot by his subordinates, but most of the arrows flew at Mac.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kang! Kang! Kang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>As Mac was striking away the arrows, Malecia picked up a spear rolling on the ground and launched a stab toward Mac’s side. Mac tried to evade with a flick of his ankle as usual, but his foot sank into the desert sand.</span></p>
