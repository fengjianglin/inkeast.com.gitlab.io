 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I rushed at the skeleton and swung my sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It quickly flew higher to avoid my sword then shouted, "You bastard! So you weren’t an ordinary priest! To be able to use a sword too, you must be a bishop-level great priest with paladin roots!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Oh right, priests could only use flying magic starting from bishop-level. I forgot.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hahaha, if you know, just obediently receive this iron mace of justice, Baldy!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The skeleton sneered. "</span><span>Puhahaha</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">! If you were a paladin, your divine magic would not be at the level of a bishop! You can't hurt me with such divine magic!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Yeah, I can't use divine magic anyway.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Totally different from just before when it was dodging in panic, the skeleton was now looking down at me with a haughty air. I didn't know what it was being so arrogant about when it couldn't even tell if my magic contained divinity or not. But let's be thankful to it for letting its guard down and hit it in the head.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I raised my sword and shouted, "But I will make this heretic who has disrespected the great goddess kneel down before my sword!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">Uuack</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">, that was cringy! But somehow, paladins and priests often said things like this. Well, I knew that these words inspired one's own faith and strengthened one's divine power, but to me, it was just saying nonsense because it didn't have that effect on me.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Hahaha! Why don’t you try it!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Um, Mr. Skeleton. Are you sure you didn’t get brain damage from having your head turned into a skull?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">How could you just receive such cheesy lines? Did you get so shocked from suddenly becoming bald that you lost your sense of shame?</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I raised my altitude rapidly and flew at the skeleton. I wrapped my sword with sword aura and tried to cut off its ribs.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">But it went further up perhaps feeling threatened by me and shot magic from a distance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Rain of hellfire!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Barrier! Thermal Insulation!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The high-heat flames that looked like black lights rained down from above. I surrounded myself with a barrier and broke through it.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The temperature of the flames that the skeleton fired must have been quite high. Even though I used magic to block out the heat, the temperature that was transmitted to me still felt quite warm.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>When I&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">broke through the rain of flames with brute force, the skeleton’s eyes of fire shook.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Was it panicking? A skeleton’s expression couldn’t be read, so it was hard for me to gauge its mental state.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">For someone like me who lived off of scamming and bluffing, the skeleton was a difficult opponent.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Wary of the sword in my hand, the skeleton created several layers of shields at once.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Haha! How is it!?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The skeleton’s shields seemed too thick to break them all with a single swing. So, all I had to do was attack several times. I swung my wand instead of the sword.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Magic bullet, mid-level machine gun version! Fire!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I casually fired a thousand rounds of magic bullets at the skeleton. Its hastily made shield was easily broken by the randomly fired magic bullets, forcing it to do random maneuvers as it shot down the magic bullets with its own magic bullets.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You, damn you! Aak! Aahaak!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">However, after being hit by one or two bullets, it was driven into a corner by a stray bullet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Space movement!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The skeleton avoided the crisis by urgently using space-movement magic. The urgently performed space-movement magic was something that could make the&nbsp;</span><span>caster lost in the space-time dimension</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;if something were to go wrong. But with good reflexes, it managed to teleport the magic bullets I shot, instead of itself.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Now, when and where those magic bullets would appear was unknown, but the skeleton had managed to overcome the crisis.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Normally, space magic itself was very difficult to cast in one go, but I guess since its life depended on it, it managed to succeed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Still, it was not perfect. It seemed to have been hit by dozens of shots as there were plenty of holes in his robe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kuok! Huk, huk!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The skeleton let out painful breath from having rapidly consumed its mana. Considering it used such high-level magic without prior preparation, of course, a large chunk of mana would get taken out.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic">But how was it breathing hard when it only had bones left?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps its body still had memories from when it was a human.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I dispersed the careless thoughts and spread invisible mines made from magic into the surrounding area without letting the skeleton notice.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Be prepared! It's time to receive God’s punishment!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Then I infused mana into the sword to create a huge sword aura and charged at the skeleton.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Keuk!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The skeleton&nbsp;</span><span>shirked</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;backwards to avoid my sword. But the surrounding space, except for the direction I was flying in, was already full of mines.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In the natural order, it ran away from me and hit a mine in the air, causing it to immediately explode.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kwang! Kwagwagwagwagwagwang!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Ah, I was too close to the skeleton and got caught in the radius of the chain explosions.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Barrier! Barrier! Barrier!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The first of the quickly raised three-layered barriers was caught in the explosion and was immediately destroyed. The second layer barely hung on and managed to retain its shape. Ever since I managed to lose the old man wearing a golden mask, I increased the power of&nbsp;</span><span>mine</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">field magic, but as I used it with my magic wand, it was much more powerful than I expected.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was my first time using this magic wand in battle, the output was so high that it was rather difficult to use. If I accidentally slipped and a mana bullet that I shot landed in the capital’s downtown, it would be no different from the military firing cannon shells at civilians. If I want to control the force, I would have to either get used to it or make an additional mana transformer to attach to it. Or another way was simply using it at full output.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At this rate, if I used this magic wand with all my might, the only person who could handle being an opponent was my father back in my hometown. Even if I went all out with this magic wand, the chance of winning was probably just under fifty-fifty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>When I think about my father's power, it was a very subjective and hopeful interpretation for me. &nbsp;But that’s better than nothing.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Just being able to contend against my father meant that there was a probability that I could run away even in the worst-case scenario of having to face him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I shook my head and got rid of the useless thoughts and approached the skeleton, who made me wonder if its bones could be cremated. Surprisingly, though only its upper body remained it still managed to retain its shape.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The skeleton looked at me with its weak flames where the eyes were supposed to be.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So it seems... you are not...a priest—"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">If I had been a priest who could use divine power, even if only a tenth of the mines had exploded, he would be walking along to Hades right now. &nbsp;But right now, although I couldn’t say it was fine, the skeleton was still alive even after that massive explosion.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I smirked and laughed. "You just figured that out now?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Damn... It! You bastard, huk! If only I had known that you are not a priest!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It definitely would have attacked me more aggressively. Perhaps it might have made the right strategic judgment and tried to draw me back into its workshop in the magic tower, then attacked me with the support of the workshop. Then it might have been a struggle.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But you thought I was a priest and didn't even try to drag me into the workshop within the magic tower."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The skeleton spoke in a tearful voice, exasperated with anger, "Yes... But it would not have been very effective to drag a bishop-level priest into the workshop full of black magic."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>It could have worked well enough against an average priest if the workshop was not&nbsp;</span><span>full&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">of black magic. However, a black magician’s natural enemy was a priest, and against the priest of the highest rank, the bishop, black magic would not have worked.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">That is, if I were an actual bishop-level priest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"In addition, you probably couldn’t drag in a bishop who used to be a paladin into the narrow passageway of the magic tower where the withdrawal path was not optimal.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's right…!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I asked the affirming skeleton, "Any last wishes?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Could you spare me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I shook my head at the desperate skeleton, who used to be the Tower Master.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"If you were still the living Tower Master, then I would have considered it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The skeleton in front of me was just a monster who had already given up on being a human. I couldn't spare such a monster. It was a ‘responsibility’ I had as a magician. One of the few responsibilities that I had.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I am! I am... The Tower Master."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, the skeleton stopped talking as if it just had lots of thoughts going through its head, then groaned.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is that so... Am I no longer the Tower Master?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I could tell that the tower master that the skeleton was referring to was not the position but as a living person.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So that was it. That was why you said you would erect a tombstone in the courtyard."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Suddenly, the skeleton muttered something I couldn't understand and gave a sigh as if he had given up.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I just wanted more knowledge. Just, to be healthier, more energetic, and to be able to live more passionately. I wanted life. Not this dying body—”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It repeatedly clenched and relaxed its hands that had already become emaciated bones. It seemed to be looking at the wrinkled hands it had just before, instead of the skinny bones.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Perhaps what it was seeing was a type of life flashing before its eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"But it seems I am already dead. Haha." The skeleton burst into a dejected laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Are you going to leave a name for the tombstone?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was already accepting his death. It shook its head with difficulty.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"My tombstone, no, the tombstone of my former self. A friend of my former self said he would set up my tombstone. Could you just write down on the tombstone that there was an unnamed skeleton here?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Is that enough?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The skeleton simply nodded. "What more can I hope for? Please don't become a monster like me."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I didn't reply. There was no need to answer because no matter what happened, I would never become as hopeless.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span>The skeleton chuckled at my silence. I don't know exactly why it laughed, but I reckoned&nbsp;</span><span>I might have a vague idea.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I put my hand between the skeleton’s ribs and grabbed the black mana stone serving as its heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Thank you."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">With its last words, I strongly pulled on the black mana stone and cut off the connection between the mana stone and the skeleton. It completely crumbled into ash.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">After watching the scene to the end, I looked around for something to use as a tombstone. When I discovered a camellia tree about 10 meters away, I used magic to move it to the place where the skeleton had crumbled away.</span></p>
 <p style="text-indent: 36pt; text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">-A nameless skeleton fell asleep here while pursuing&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 700; font-style: italic">his</span><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;dream.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">I carved it into the camellia tree and turned around.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The aftertaste was somehow bitter. It'd still be a while before sunrise, but I felt like I wouldn’t be able to sleep tonight.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As I looked up into the sky, there were so many stars. As I tried to lower my head again, space opened up in the sky and large lumps of mana began to pour down.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Ara?! Aren’t those the magic bullets I had shot?!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hundreds of magic bullets quickly rained down from the opened space and crashed directly into the magic tower.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 700; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Kwagwagwang-!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The Red Magic Tower began to crumble due to my magic bullets as if it was following the master's footsteps.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">While looking at the falling magic tower, I had a thought...&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Is this all my fault?</span></p>
