 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The elders were surprised by Doomstone's words.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"When Den was 12, I went to a nearby dragon den and threw him into it."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Elder Mirpa frowned and said, "You mean that evil hobby of yours?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other elders were also well aware that Doomstone made his sons overcome their fear of monsters by tossing them before monsters, demons, and dragons at the ages of five, eight, and twelve respectively.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Since Doomstone was watching from the shadows, his sons were never in any real danger. In addition, he would be able to gain the dignity of a patriarch if he were to kill the monsters in an emergency. Therefore, he considered it as an education method that killed two birds with one stone&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"What do you mean, evil hobby? It’s just my teaching method. Anyway, when he was 12, I threw Den in front of a dragon. He started running around at first, but then later, he started going back and forth with magic until he eventually cut the dragon’s throat with a knife.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">All along Elder Mirpa had been frowning, but at those words, his eyes opened wide in surprise.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Doomstone was surprised by Elder Mirpa's reaction.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">‘I thought this old man Mirpa would know since he’s close to Den.’</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Chief, is this true?" the other elders were surprised as well and asked Doomstone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes. He caught a dragon which even adults struggle with."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Was it a baby dragon?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How could defeating a baby dragon be educational? It was a fully grown dragon."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How old was it?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"It seemed to be a little over 300 years old."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So you are saying that the dragon back then was caught by the kid and not you?!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The elders discussed Denburg's current age amongst themselves and also talked about the future.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Ahem, okay. You are saying that the kid caught a dragon and didn’t mention a single word to me?" Elder Mirpa muttered while being dissatisfied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"When do you intend on passing the title to the child?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The buzzing room became quiet upon Mirpa's question.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"When he becomes moderately stronger than me or when I start to lose strength."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Since there is no chance of you ever losing strength, it means that he will have to become stronger than you. That will be at least 20 years hence, so why are you already talking about this?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone scratched his head and laughed. "Hahaha, I ended up revealing it to my children, so I wanted to let you know a little bit earlier."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Bastard! With my current age, I’ll be lying in a coffin after 20 years!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"So are you not going to attend the festival?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A grand festival was held on the day a new village head was appointed. Due to this, the coronation came to be known as the festival.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You bastard! What do you mean I’m not going to attend the festival? You know how much I love to drink!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">The other elders laughed at Elder Mirpa’s outburst.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Knock, knock!</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Along with the knock came Hestia’s voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Father, it's almost time for Denburg’s coming of age ceremony."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone looked at the clock and got up from his seat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh, it's already time for my son's coming-of-age ceremony. If you'll excuse me.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I'll go along as well. I also want to take a look at the next chief of the village."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When one of the elders started rising from his seat, the other elders joined him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone scratched his head and said, "Okay. Well sure."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although it was called a coming of age ceremony, it was at most a gathering of family and friends where they would dole out advice on responsibility and such. After that, all they had to do was go hunt for monsters to prove their adulthood, and then they would all eat together. Usually, there was no need to go too far out of the village since people would gather in front of the village hall and report before the event.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">In front of the town hall stood the eldest son Gallahad, the second oldest son Gawain, the eldest daughter Hestia as well as the younger daughter Leisha.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Where is Denburg?"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When Doomstone asked Leisha, she shrugged and said she didn't know.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It felt a little strange. Denburg was unusually diligent. When he made a promise or had something to do, he would be the first to come out and wait. Moreover, he was very smart and would have already anticipated Doomstone rallying up the elders and bringing them along. Also, Hestia would have reminded Denburg should he have somehow missed that fact, so he should have known better than to be late.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was very strange that Denburg was not here already. But thinking back to the screws missing inside him somewhere, perhaps it wasn’t as strange after all. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone apologized to the elders and then looked at his watch. He had been waiting for noon, that was when the coming of age ceremony was arranged to start. But Denburg was nowhere to be seen even after the appointed time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Sensing something fishy, one by one, Doomstone looked at his children. But they all shook their heads indicating they were oblivious as well.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Father." Perhaps feeling a bit strange, Hestia called out to her father.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">When she saw Doomstone nod, she nodded back and ran towards the house.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Oh sister, where are you going?" Leisha called out to Hestia, but the latter had quickly disappeared.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Not long after, Hestia came back running while hauling the corpse of a demon twice her size with one hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Father! Look at this!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Hestia, in a rarely heard loud voice, handed Doomstone a piece of paper folded in half with an urgent look on her face.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">On the folded paper, in a neat handwriting, was written- ‘To my beloved family’.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">It was easy to see that this was Denburg's handwriting.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">To my beloved family,&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">I suspect that it will be Hestia who first discovers this letter after sensing something amiss. It will probably be just a few minutes past noon now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Although I hope that this letter will be found later, in nine out of ten cases, the letter will be discovered at the aforementioned time. It will be impossible for the letter or the demon corpse to be discovered before that time since the magic I cast wouldn’t have been lifted yet.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">To answer Hestia who will be wondering why I let the demon corpse and the letter be discovered at noon, I hope she’ll understand if I tell her, "I wanted to narrow down the range of possibilities since it will be discovered that I ran away anyways."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Now, to be blunt and forthright, I'm planning on leaving this village and going to a new place. As you read this letter, you might be wondering why a man with a future as the head of the village is leaving (I'm an adult now, so I'm going to describe it as leaving and not running away from home).&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">But to be honest, I don't really have any desire to be the head of the village. If Father hadn't told me he was planning on making me be the head of the village, I wouldn't have left without a word. Oh, that doesn't mean I didn't have any plans of leaving the village.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Father, I don't want you to have any regrets or blame yourself for what happened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Aside from wanting to do something meaningful, it seems that the biggest reason I left is that I have a great desire to see the world. I'll contact you regularly, at least once a month, so please don't worry too much.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">P.S.1: The demon corpse that came along with the letter is my hunt for the coming of age ceremony. Don’t treat me like a child and tell me later that I didn’t perform the coming of age ceremony.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">P.S.2: As a gift for leaving the village, I hunted down the entire herd of demons. There are about 40 of them, so follow the map I drew and retrieve them to contribute to the village's supply.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">P.S.3: I'll take some maps, food, and imperial money from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Well, even so, these will only be worth two or three tooth of the demons I caught.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">P.S.4. Come to think of it, I wrote this letter as if writing to my oldest sister, so it’s written informally. When Father reads it, please read it while substituting it with honorifics.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">Always hoping for happiness among the family.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">-&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Written by the</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic">&nbsp;beloved youngest son.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone suddenly felt his blood pressure beginning to rise.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">“Hahaha, to think that my youngest son prepared such a surprise event!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Captain of the guards!"&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Doomstone's call, Gallahad answered with a nervous look, "Yes!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Except for the minimum manpower required for village security, go catch Denburg BLADE!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone ordered as he yelled out his youngest son’s name.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gallahad, however, was a little reluctant. "Father? Still, investing that kind of manpower is —”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Why? Do you want to be the next chief? Do you want to spend your life inside that troublesome pile of documents?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, Sir! Excluding 300 guards required for security, I'll lead 1,200 people and bring him back!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gallahad made a rarely performed salute and quickly took to his heels.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Do you really not want to live inside that pile of documents that much?</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"General of the warrior force."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, Sir."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"How many men do we need to butcher 40 of these demons?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain, while looking at the demon left by Denburg, considered for a moment before answering. "A hundred and twenty people, no, a hundred is enough."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Butchering monsters was quite a difficult task. In fact, the figure of a hundred and twenty mentioned earlier was already considered low taking into account only three people were being assigned to each monster. But Gawain had further reduced the number as if he understood Doomstone's current feelings.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Although Doomstone felt grateful, he couldn't make the warriors suffer because his son had fled away as the head of the village.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Assign two hundred men to butchering and send the rest to catch Denburg."&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Thanks to Gawain's consideration, Doomstone felt a little bit of reasoning return to his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes. I'll lead three hundred warriors and return."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Gawain saluted and ran in the direction of the warrior force.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Foreign Minister, no, since he is not here, Leisha. Go explain the situation to the minister and have him send a guide for the pursuit. "</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Yes, Father. There doesn’t seem to be anyone who can counter Denburg’s magic, so I’ll go as well."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone thanked Leisha and sent her on her way. He then turned towards the gathered elders and said, "Ahem, I apologize for the embarrassment."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">At Doomstone's heartfelt apology, the elders waved their hands and said it was okay.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"No, I should say that this is exactly what I expected from your son."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"You caused incidents of this magnitude yourself when you were a child."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"That's right, that's right. It was worse when you were a kid."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"I'd rather say that up until now, they haven't acted like your sons at all."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Every word spoken by the elders stabbed Doomstone in the chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, didn't he also cause a lot of accidents when he was young because he didn't want to become the chief?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Due to his past history, everyone agreed that the incident Denburg caused wasn’t an incident at all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Doomstone began to wonder whether he should be rejoicing or lamenting.</span></p>
