 <p><span style>Chapter 373: Divine Class Potential</span></p>
 <p>Repressing a belly full of rage, the examiner gave a level three mission token to Jiang Chen, laughing coldly, “Room 68, go there yourself.”</p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s expression was remote as he took possession of the mission token, heading for room 68. He could naturally make out from the examiner’s malicious attitude that he was likely from the Purple Sun Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With Master Shuiyue as a previous example however, the examiner would only be making trouble for himself if he tried to do anything in the exams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Others had requested the level three mission in the pill area before, but an instance would only occur once every few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all of the candidates in the great hall heard that the secular genius had requested this mission, they cast sideways glances at each other and put their heads together, thinking that this was incredible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This secular genius is simply too cocky! He went for a level three mission? Is he really treating this subject as his own backyard, for him to play around in however he’d like?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Level three mission? He’s going to run out in a second with dust on his face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Definitely. How many geniuses have failed on a level three mission? An ordinary kid dares take the challenge? He’s being overconfident like teaching his grandma to suck eggs!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not necessarily, I’ve heard that he completed a level two mission yesterday. He even beat Tang Hong from the Precious Tree Sect previously on the pill foundation exam.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? That foolish muscle guy Tang Hong?” Someone asked in surprise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A huge roar sounded from outside the hall when that question was asked. “Which bastard is running his mouth about me behind my back?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An enthusiastic and vigorous form charged in, grabbing the fellow who’d spoke and threw him out before he’d even had time to react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Screw you man. You take me for a sick cat if I don’t show you that I’m still a tiger! Try talking about me behind my back next time, see if I don’t break your bones!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong had been a bit late because he was still training. When he made it here, he happened to hear someone talking bad about him, that he was a foolish muscle guy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>People talking about others behind their backs was what Tang Hong hated most in this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, c’mere. What were you talking about just now?” Tang Hong pointed at another candidate who’d taken part in the discussions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The candidate’s face was ashen as he looked at Tang Hong in fine fettle. He knew that this primitive brute was about to go on a rampage. Fear pricked his heart, but he didn’t conceal anything and gave a full accounting of everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Challenging a level three mission?” Tang Hong’s eyes lit up when he heard this. He slapped his thigh and complimented. “My boss alright! Such charisma!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong laughed heartily and ignored the gossiping candidates. Although these fellows were all part of the sky quadrant, their strength was in the lower echelons. They naturally didn’t dare offend Tang Hong, someone who would rank in the top ten. They all rubbed their noses and shrank to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I request a level two mission.” Tang Hong seemed to have been affected by Jiang Chen as he also walked up with a heroic, expansive air and slapped his token down onto the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Purple Sun Sect examiner was the type to hate one thing on account of another. He turned his attentions to Tang Hong, but didn’t dare cause trouble for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could inwardly curse that both of them would fail so that they would face the penalty of being barred for five days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Foolish brute, wallowing in degeneration to take a country bumpkin as a boss. This brat is throwing away all of the Precious Tree Sect’s face.” The examiner grumbled privately.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen entered the exam room and started his new challenge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A level three mission was indeed much harder than a level two mission. However, to Jiang Chen, there was no problem that was insurmountable for him when it came to pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The mission requested that candidates select the useful ingredients from a pile of a thousand and put them together to form a base that could be used to refine pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The request was that candidates be able to put together ten recipes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quite a few ingredients were needed to refine a single type of pill. It could range anywhere from four to more than ten ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One main ingredient was definitely needed, the amount of the rest of the complementing ingredients could be many or few.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was quite a tall task to put together ten pill recipes from the mess of a thousand ingredients here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four hours were given for such a task.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For an ordinary cultivator, a thousand ingredients were enough of a headache. It would take at least an hour to organize them all and finely identify them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was even harder when one needed to put them into recipe combinations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To Jiang Chen however, these pills were all novice level creations. There was nothing difficult about them at all. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly sorted them all and picked out which ones could be useful in refinement, which could be the main ingredient.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He quickly picked thirty or forty ingredients suitable for being the main ingredient in a recipe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Recipes having to do with these ingredients then rose in his mind. He looked over all of them, and then looked at the other ingredients.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If all complementing ingredients were present, then he could put them together as one recipe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He proceeded neatly in this manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One had to say, this level three mission was indeed complex, but that was only for outsiders. To well-versed experts, the most complicated things were easy, if they attacked the problem with the right methods.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was said that problems were difficult for those who didn’t know how to tackle them, but those who did wouldn’t find them hard at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were 23 recipe combinations in front of Jiang Chen after an hour. He confirmed them again and again, ensuring that there was nothing wrong with all of these small and large recipes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen made identifying marks on each of these combinations. He also summarized what pills could be refined, the pills’ name, and the general theory behind each pill.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Exactly two hours had passed after he’d completed all this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finally confirmed that all was in order, Jiang Chen walked out and said to the examiner outside the room. “I’m done, will you check please?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The examiner was also surprised at Jiang Chen’s speed, but didn’t say anything. He walked into &nbsp;the room and was greeted by the sight of 23 combinations. Detailed, complete, visible at a glance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These… these are all your combinations? So many?” The examiner was shocked as he stared dumbly at the combinations. There were 23 of them! Far in excess of the 10 required by the mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The examiner was thrown into a disarray after counting up the number. It was as if someone had suddenly targeted his acupoint and had petrified him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed. According to my calculations, this should be the limit. The rest of the ingredients won’t be able to form another recipe.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of this, Jiang Chen was quite certain of.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The examiner took quite a while to respond as his voice was full of emotion. He tsk’ed in amazement. “Genius, genius… we’ve also simulated this mission before and 23 recipes are indeed the greatest number of combinations that can be made. But did you know how long we took to simulate this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long?” Jiang Chen was taken aback. He hadn’t thought that the examiner would talk about this with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eight of us participated, and we spent 32 hours, working day and night, to come to this conclusion and be certain that we hadn’t overlooked anything. Indeed, 23 combinations is the limit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The examiner sighed again. “Genius, such genius. I have to say, this is divine class potential! I have truly learnt something today. It’s not difficult for us to complete ten combinations in a short amount of time, but for you to have identified all combinations in such a short amount of time, this is indeed heaven defying potential.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This examiner was completely different from the Purple Sun Sect examiner at the entrance of the area. His tones and words were full of admiration.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was indeed as he’d said. It was an easy thing for the examiners to complete this mission in a short amount of time, given their potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But to use half the allotted time to identify all 23 combinations, what was this if not a freak genius?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was almost outside the scope of his imagination.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young man, you’re the youngster gifted with the most pill talent that I’ve seen thus far. Don’t be unworthy of your talents!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The examiner’s tone was grave and earnest. His heart of treasuring talent was quite evident.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled, “Then, have I passed?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The examiner couldn’t help but laugh, “If I don't pass you, then us old men would likely never pass as well. Not only do you pass, but you pass with flying colors for your miraculous completion. If it wasn’t for the rules dictating that a level three mission could only be awarded 40 points, I would give you 80 or 160 points if it were up to me! I think that your answer scroll is absolutely perfect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The examiner was profuse with his praise as he marked the token with his unique sign. “Go and obtain your points. Youngster, I’m certain that there will come a day that you’re the most venerated pill master in the sixteen kingdoms!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely the highest praise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled faintly. He felt that it was touching that someone was encouraging him so kindly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young man, with your strength, you can absolutely challenge a level four mission. There have only been three instances of a candidate challenging a level four mission up until now. Only one has succeeded. I hope you can be the second.” The examiner encouraged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s not much meaning in being second. If I’m going to do it, I’m going to be the first. Has anyone ever requested a level five mission?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one thus far had requested a requested a level five mission yet. To be frank, only a sparse few had requested a level four mission up to this point. It’d only be requested three times in the last sixty, seventy days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And, only one instance had resulted in success. The successful case had been lucky, the mission hadn’t been that difficult then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since someone had successfully passed a level four mission, no one had dared challenge it afterwards. It was too difficult. For any of the candidates to succeed, they would have insane heaven-defying good luck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was already something to be proud of having completed a level three mission. At least, up until now, there had been only 10 successful instances of passing a level three pill mission in the last sixty days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen returned with a triumphant smile. When the Purple Sun Sect examiner took Jiang Chen’s token, his very face turned green.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d been taunting and jeering Jiang Chen before, and now, Jiang Chen had slapped him back in the most thorough way possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jiang Chen took back his candidate token, the points on it had changed to 160 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>100 foundation points, 20 from a level two mission, 40 from a level three. He now had 160 points!</span></p>
