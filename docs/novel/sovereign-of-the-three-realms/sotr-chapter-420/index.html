 <p><span style>Chapter 420: Internal Conflict, Internal Strife</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go, kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four great champions had always cooperated well with each other. Four beams of light shot into the skies with splendid radiance, each of them wielding their own weapons.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a seemingly simple attack was actually split into four quadrants, sealing off all space. This was a common tactic they used.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it didn’t count as the mysteries of a formation, they cooperated very well together, and so their strength was enormous.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen snorted softly as he was holding the high vantage point, waved with his hand, and sent out four golden beams of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden beams streaked through the air, transforming into four shooting stars, and vanished into thin air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the four champions felt their bodies grow cold as a golden colored light flashed in front of their very eyes. A gout of cold air blew straight at them, making their necks feel cold.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that critical moment, when they realized that something was wrong, the four beams of golden light had already flashed past their necks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The golden light churned!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strong crisp sound akin to snapping a wooden stick in half rang out at this point, so sharp it made one’s hair stand on end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the next moment, the momentum of the four great champions halted as they froze in midair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Four bloody beams of light shone out at almost the exact same time as the four heads shooting into the skies. Their eyes were filled with incredulity as they looked towards the ground below, watching their heads somehow bizarrely separated from their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All sorts of thoughts they had at this moment soon withered into dreadful misery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They knew that this would be the last thing they would ever witness in their lives.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam, bam, bam, bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The four headless corpses plummeted first. They crashed despairingly into the dust as blood poured out from their necks in great gushes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Next, the four heads that had shot to a peak height in the sky began to descend as well.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam, bam, bam, bam!</span></i><span style> They too landed at the same time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dying with dissatisfaction and everlasting regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four greatest spirit realm champions of the Shangyang Kingdom had been slain in the skies above the palace with one move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire palace, which had at least a hundred thousand of spectators, had seen this happen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that moment, Wu Hong almost collapsed to his knees on the ground. Their nation’s four greatest champions had been slaughtered in a second!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The opponent was so strong to the point of being terrifying.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was even more horrifying was that this opponent came for Wu Hong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it were before, he would’ve been a key target to protect because he was the crown prince. Even the four great champions would’ve given their all to protect him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was difficult to tell just how much of that loyalty remained after the four champions had been beheaded with one stroke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, this opponent was simply too strong. He was so strong that they couldn’t fight him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>King Wu Tan also felt this throat grow dry. He’d thought that even if the combined strength of the four champions couldn’t win against Jiang Chen, they’d at least be able to fight him to a draw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But the battle situation had changed simply too quickly, so fast that he didn’t even have time to react.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four champions’ heads were separated from their bodies in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were of the seventh level spirit realm! They would be high levels of existence even in the Purple Sun Sect. If it wasn’t for Wu Tan having quite a bit of face, he never wouldn’t be able to mobilize these four cultivators to become the nation’s champions!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Tan’s strength was indeed above them, but that was on a single combat basis. If the four acted together, Wu Tan felt that he wouldn’t be able to hold up beneath their onslaught either.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now, they'd been incredulously killed in front of the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to that scene, the fighting spirit of Wu Tan and the royal experts were almost all instantly completed shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strong cultivators abounded amongst the royal experts, but even the strongest leader wasn’t as strong as the four champions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even they had been instantly slaughtered, what else did the rest of them have to compete?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, please return to the palace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protect the king! Protect His Majesty! Retreat to the palace, and reinforce the defenses!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Bitterness filled Wu Tan’s mouth. Retreating to the palace meant lowering his head in front of Jiang Chen. As the ruler of a nation, bowing his head now would be a fatal blow to both morale and his authority.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw the king was hesitating, the royal experts all advised, “Your Majesty, this villain is strong and we cannot withstand him. We must seek succor in the palace and defend with our lives until the sect reinforcements arrive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Royal father, let us take cover for now.” Wu Hong also had a long face on. He knew that he had gotten himself into great trouble this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, now that things were like this, Wu Hong also knew that there was no point in regretting it. He knew that since all this had been done with authorization from the Purple Sun Sect, he had no other choice but to do as they say.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he had refused to heed the intentions of the senior executives, then the position of the Wu family would be endangered as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, he was well aware that he had to have done what he did, and there was no turning back once he set down that path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, never in his wildest dreams had he thought that Jiang Chen would be able to escape the Eternal Spirit Mountain, and also unleash all his wrath at Shangyang Kingdom without mercy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, we can always live on to fight another day! This brat is so arrogant that the Purple Sun Sect will be sure to destroy him. We’re just being ordered by the Purple Sun Sect, and Jiang Chen’s true target is them. The senior executives of the Purple Sun Sect will not sit idly by. There’s no big deal if we lose all face in front of this little thief. Wasn’t a genius such as Long Juxue also slain by this brat?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Hong wasn’t thinking as much as Wu Tan did at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He only wanted to stay alive right now and hang on until reinforcements from the Purple Sun Sect arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen glared downwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wu Tan, I gave you a chance and you didn’t treasure it. From now on, regardless of where they are, I will come take all the lives of your Wu family clan! I will return to you tenfold the number of Jiang family members you killed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s voice was full of lethal intent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Tan’s face was ashen as he shouted, “Jiang Chen, every wrong has a source and every loan its creditor! If you really have the ability, you should go to the Purple Sun Sect! What are you doing here, causing a fuss in our secular kingdom? Sect disciples cannot intervene in the matters of the secular kingdoms. This is the rule of the sixteen kingdom alliance!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Rule?” Jiang Chen laughed heartily. “Did the Wu clan think about the rules when they slaughtered all those people in my clan? Did you speak of rules when you seized the Hall of Healing for yourself?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t talk to me about rules! The rules of the sixteen kingdom alliance aren’t worth shit! I only have one rule—I will not attack unless I am attacked, and if I am, I will return it to you tenfold!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen pointed at the circular moat. “From now on, everyone is only allowed to enter the Shangyang palace and not a single soul shall leave it. Those who dare cross this moat will be executed!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he finished speaking, he waved his arm and the swordbirds dived down like a rain of shooting stars. He had deployed the million strong swordbird army this time, and it really was quite a sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under the leadership of hundreds of Goldwing Swordbirds, the aura of the swordbird army was ten times more impressive than their previous deployment was at the Second Crossing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The million strong Swordbird army started screaming shrilly in unison. They created a current that swept into the cloud layers furiously. The upper skies of the Shangyang Kingdom became filled with dark storm clouds in an instant, as if the heavens were ready to pour forth a great storm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This kind of scene was as if calamitous disaster was about to descend upon the Shangyang Kingdom. It put pressure on everyone in the kingdom, and they were frightened beyond belief.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Wu Tan saw Jiang Chen displaying his prowess, a light had danced in his darkened face. He finally gave a wave of his hand and gritted his teeth. “Retreat into the palace and activate the highest level defenses. Open the underground tunnels and be ready to cover the retreat of the royal children and the disciples! Summon the three external branches to assist and coordinate with us on the inside.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The three external branches of the Purple Sun Sect were all within the Shangyang Kingdom. The journey wasn’t far, and they would be here almost as soon as they were summoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen watched Wu Tan retreat into the palace with a cold smile, and was in no hurry to pursue him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had utmost confidence, and these folks were only struggling on the edge of death in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the Wu family clan had hardened their hearts to resist to the end, then Jiang Chen naturally wouldn’t have any room for leniency in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the Purple Sun Sect had never shown any form of benevolence when they were suppressing him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Neither had the Wu clan when they slaughtered the Jiang clan or taken over the Hall of Healing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since they were enemies and also robbers to boot, they should naturally be exterminated. Was there any need for mercy?</span></p>
 <p><span style>So now, Jiang Chen was going to visit upon them the exact same treatment he’d received.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Purple Sun Sect was domineering and viewed people to be as worthless as grass. They always thought they themselves were strong, and so it was the natural course of order to suppress, oppress, and take from others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To the Purple Sun Sect, strength was everything and conferred upon them legitimacy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who were lesser than them were ants, and so should be stepped on, crushed, and slaughtered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, Jiang Chen was only returning the way of the Purple Sun Sect to their kind, that was all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His heart was as calm as still water, without the slightest ripple in it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d had enough of the Purple Sun Sect. This time, he was going to etch his image upon them so vividly that &nbsp;their scalps would tingle with numbness and the hairs of their bodies stand on end whenever they evoked his memory!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Defenses were heavy around the inner courtyard of the inner palace. All of the palace’s mechanisms and restrictions had been activated.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But even so, Wu Tan and son still didn’t have the slightest feeling of security at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their opponent was simply too strong, to the point that they couldn’t even estimate his strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Royal father, when will the Purple Sun Sect reinforcements arrive?” Wu Tan’s heart was in his throat as he felt fear he’d never known before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Tan’s face was grave as he shook his head without another word. Now that things have escalated to this extent, they could only leave their fates in the hands of heaven. It was hard to tell whether the defenses of the palace could last until reinforcements from the sect arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The father and son duo usually leisurely controlled the life and death of others in their everyday rule of the Shangyang Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, they had come to the disastrous conclusion that their fates were now at the mercy of someone else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They’d always been the ones calling the shots, and the others were mere fodder. But now they had become the hunted &nbsp;instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, this is bad! The manor of the Prince of Benevolence has been subjected to unknown attack! The Wu clan family members…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What of them?” Wu Tan’s eyes widened as his scalp tingled with numbness. The Prince of Benevolence was his younger brother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“None… none had managed to escape.” The messenger almost didn’t dare meet Wu Tan’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, tragic tidings! The Prince of Kindness was killed in his manor!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, the manor of the Prince of Humility was ambushed, and the prince is nowhere to be found…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All sorts of bad news filled in like the tidewaters. Danger suffused the entire palace like the rainwaters flooding in an old, shabby house during a downpour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your Majesty, there are large numbers of royal relatives, clan relatives, and royal&nbsp;</span><span style>concubines outside requesting to enter the premises and seek protection!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were currently in Wu Tan’s bedchambers, and Wu Hong wouldn’t be allowed in here under normal circumstances. However, Wu Hong was temporarily allowed to be in here due to the ongoing crisis.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t thought that when fright struck into the hearts of everyone, they would all flock to Wu Tan’s chambers as they knew the defenses around his chambers were the strongest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Tan was in a conundrum all of a sudden. There wasn’t enough space for everyone, and chaos would easily ensue when there were many people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But if he didn’t accept them, that meant he was giving up on these relatives, which would undoubtedly send an exceedingly bad signal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, don’t you dare push me too far!” Fire spat out of Wu Tan’s eyes.</span></p>
