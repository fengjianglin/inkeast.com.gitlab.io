<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 459: Traveling to the Regal Pill Palace</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen wasn’t depressed after he learned of the enormous gap he had to surmount. On the contrary, he was even more motivated to train.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I was able to make three great strides in a few years and enter the origin realm from the true qi realm. Why cannot I continue this momentum and assail the sage realm, or even emperor realm in a few more years?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>What Jiang Chen lacked the least now was confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Precious Tree Sect had also understood this gap at the same time and would no longer stand still, refusing to make progress and clinging to their boring, sectarian views.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Thousandleaf said without hesitation, “Sage Dan Chi, my Precious Tree Sect has a favor to ask.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please, speak.” Dan Chi was a forthright person who wasn’t overly concerned with details.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our two sects are both raising Jiang Chen, I hope to send a few more young disciples to the Regal Pill Palace for further training. With how the situation is changing, I’m worried that if these young folk will be unable to keep up with the times if they remain in the Precious Tree Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousandleaf pointed at Tang Hong and the others. “These are the cream of the younger generation in the Precious Tree Sect. Although they aren’t on the same level as the premier geniuses of the Regal Pill Palace, they are still the elite of my sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi had naturally since seen that Tang Hong was brothers with Jiang Chen. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As for &nbsp;the others such as Xie Yufan, Lian Canghai, and Iron Dazhi, they were all the best the Precious Tree Sect had to offer. Along with Tang Hong, they made up the four geniuses of the Precious Tree Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi would naturally not decline this kind of small matter. He waved his hand and smiled, “These are all small matters since our two sects have allied together. Jiang Chen, what do you think?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was apparent from Dan Chi’s sudden inquiry of Jiang Chen that he quite valued Jiang Chen’s opinions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Iron Long from the Precious Tree Sect almost couldn’t sit still when he heard this question, his heart clenching with anxiety. He was quite worried that Jiang Chen was holding a grudge and would prevent Iron Dazhi and Lian Canghai from proceeding to the Regal Pill Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lian Canghai and Iron Dazhi both knew that this was an opportunity to change their fates. Their hearts shot to their throats, the very picture of anxiety as they looked at Jiang Chen nervously. Desperately worried about the outcome, they almost couldn’t bear the suspense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their future and destiny were in his hands at this moment, how would they not be nervous?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen wasn’t the sort to bear a grudge. The Iron family had been more or less sincere in their softened attitude, and they’d sent over vast amounts of resources to make up to him afterwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he hadn’t accepted them, he had no need to go toe to toe with them, not with his current status.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’d be more lively with more people as well. It also saves me from going to the Regal Pill Palace myself, all by my lonesome. In my view, the younger generation will need someone to keep us in line. Why doesn’t Forefather Thousandleaf hold down the fort at the Precious Tree Sect, and Venerated Chonglou lead the group to the Regal Pill Palace?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen hadn’t forgotten Lordmaster Ye Chonglou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If choosing between Forefather Thousandleaf and Ye Chonglou, he was still biased towards the latter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Forefather Thousandleaf had helped him greatly and seemed to be a sincere person, all of that aid had been added grace to what was already beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chonglou was different. It had been Lordmaster Ye Chonglou who’d stretched out a helping hand when Jiang Chen was at his lowest and in need of help. He’d sent Jiang Chen the warmth of coal when he was stuck in the snow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This kind of relationship was different.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi smiled, “This would be for the best. I will be able to discuss with Daoist Ye if anything comes up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Thousandleaf naturally wouldn’t object. He too felt that it would be a good thing if Ye Chonglou went to supervise these young men.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sage Dan Chi also arranged for the group of Regal Pill Palace disciples to take up residence in the Precious Tree Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, to avoid the matter of disciples not willing to spend a prolonged period of time in the Precious Tree Sect, the group would be rotated every half year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In addition, those who came to stay in the Precious Tree Sect would see their sect benefits doubled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This way, those who were sent to the Precious Tree Sect didn’t have much of an opinion, and were inwardly delighted instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We walk towards high heights. It is naturally a good thing for Sir Jiang to go to the Regal Pill Palace. Huang’er is Sir Jiang’s patient and is naturally happy for your future path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no surprise in Huang'er's tone, as if Jiang Chen leaving for the Regal Pill Palace was completely within her expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s just a pity that I’ll have to bid farewell to the flowersI’ve cultivated in these past couple of days. I will rather miss them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang'er sighed lightly, some yearning filling her tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If anyone else had said those words, she would’ve appeared quite coy and fake. However, the presence that Huang'er exuded seemed to make this flora part of her family, that her words were an outpouring of true emotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Gouyu and the others, they were long since used to this kind of migration. When they heard that Jiang Chen had a better place to go to, they would naturally follow him to the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Third uncle Jiang Tong and cousin Jiang Yu had long since settled into their lives in the Skylaurel Kingdom and were flourishing very well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Cousin Jiang Yu in particular, had earned a place among the senior ranks in the Myriad Treasures Palace, married, had children, and was living a life that was the envy of others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qiao Baishi was enjoying marital bliss with Elder Ning, sharing a tender love and also held a high position with authority in the Azure Heaven Southern Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had their own stable lives; each with power, and status that they never would’ve thought possible in the Eastern Kingdom. This was enough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen naturally wouldn’t disturb them now that they reached their own happy endings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Chen, are you really not taking me with you?” Old man Fei Xuan had a look of dejection on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was absolutely and thoroughly willing to go with Jiang Chen, but the latter wasn’t planning on taking him this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ole Fei, you’re an elder in the Precious Tree Sect, a position with immense authority. None of us know what things will look like in the Regal Pill Palace, so why waste time there? Why not develop with peacefully in the Precious Tree Sect and support Forefather Thousandleaf? If you still think of what I’ve done for you, then please take care of my uncle, cousin, Qiao Baishi and the others.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fei Xuan nodded, “But of course. Forefather Thousandleaf would’ve made sure of that even without your say so. Who would dare touch them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just who would be so blind as to provoke Jiang Chen’s family?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yang Zhao and Lu Wuji had been unable to bear up in the face of Jiang Chen’s wrath even before he’d been discovered by the sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that his name was known throughout the sixteen kingdoms, who would dare tug on the tiger’s whiskers?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once everything had been arranged, the group set out under Ye Chonglou’s guidance to hasten to the Regal Pill Palace with Dan Chi and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When a well wrapped Huang'er showed up with a cape in the entourage, Dan Chi threw a surprised look her way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the group passed through Myriad Spirit Sect territory, Jiang Chen thought of his brother Liu Wencai. He said to Dan Chi, “Sage Dan Chi, I have an old friend, a brother in the Myriad Spirit Sect. I know not when I’ll see him again with my departure. I’d like to go see him. Please go ahead if you have urgent matters, I’ll catch up.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sure, we’ll go on ahead first then.” Dan Chi responded readily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from Tang Hong, none of the others in the Precious Tree Sect had any relationship with Liu Wencai. Therefore, Jiang Chen brought his followers and Tang Hong up the mountain towards the Myriad Spirit Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi’s gaze grew a bit thoughtful as he watched them leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Lordmaster Ye, is the caped young girl a Precious Tree Sect disciple?” Dan Chi suddenly asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Chonglou shook his head. “No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then what is her background?” Dan Chi was quite curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve never seen the girl before, but judging from her acting like sisters with his follower Gouyu, she is likely a friend from the Eastern Kingdom?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang'er was very mysterious as she dwelled in deep seclusion and rarely emerged. The lordmaster naturally had no idea of her background.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Eastern Kingdom?” Dan Chi smiled wryly and dismissed that thought. The Eastern Kingdom was uncommon enough to have already produced one Jiang Chen. It seemed quite impossible for it to produce another even more mysterious young girl.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi actually discovered a deep sense of profoundness on Huang'er that he couldn’t wholly see through.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was unable to determine just how strong she was, just a vague sense of being unable to grasp her fully due to the mysterious aura about her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t help but be curious when faced with this kind of indistinct perception.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>After many many checkpoints, Jiang Chen made it through the restricted areas of the Myriad Spirit Sect and finally reached their inner door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This sect’s territory was much larger than the Precious Tree Sect’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Along the way, the roar of tigers and the screeches of apes washed through the air. All sorts of spirit creatures bayed to the heavens, a tumultuous cacophony of noise. You could find spirit creatures in the mountain valley, on the highest peaks, as well as in and around the creeks and rivers that wound through the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Different sects had different styles, and the Myriad Spirit Sect was quite different indeed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, what brings you here?” Liu Wencai was delighted to see Jiang Chen. “My sect head actually came out of closed door cultivation when he heard you’d arrived and is setting up a banquet to welcome you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Venerated Ninelion of the Myriad Spirit Sect quite admired Jiang Chen. His personality was very similar as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jiang Chen had said to Venerated Ninelion that Liu Wencai was worthy of the sect’s attention and care, Ninelion had taken Jiang Chen seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Wencai was now Ninelion’s true disciple, his position near the top of the sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d even suppressed those once premier Myriad Spirit geniuses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen wasn’t surprised. There was an enormous power within Liu Wencai that, while still yet to be fully uncovered, was astounding enough after being catalyzed by the Redscaled Firelizard bloodline.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would absolutely be able to dominate anyone in his sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, Tang Hong, congratulations and best wishes for you to realize your ambitions in the Regal Pill Palace, placing your name on the Myriad Hidden Dragon Rankings one day!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Wencai was quite forthright and genuinely happy for Jiang Chen and Tang Hong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wencai, you too will shine greatly one day with your potential. Your name will appear on those rankings as well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s tone was firm, he thought quite highly of Liu Wencai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The latter smiled slightly, “Perhaps we might meet again in the Myriad Domain in the near future.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Why do you say that?” Jiang Chen started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The alliance between the Precious Tree Sect and the Regal Pill Palace opened a new door to the Myriad Domain. The four families of the Great Cathedral have extended an olive branch to our sect now, and the sect head is considering which family would be more appropriate to ally with.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six powers of the Myriad Domain were known as one hall, two palaces, and three sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ‘one hall’ referred to the Great Cathedral, the undisputed leader and strongest of the six powers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When its four families gathered together, they possessed the strength of a third rank sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a rather surprising bit of news, but it was absolutely a good thing for Liu Wencai that the Great Cathedral wanted to ally with the Myriad Spirit Sect.</span></p>
