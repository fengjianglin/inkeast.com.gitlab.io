Every inch of skin, every bone in his body cried out in agony.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Am I dead? Am I suffering in the fires of purgatory that burn in hell?” Jiang Chen’s first instinct was that he was dead, but the tenuous hint of breath in his body seemed to remind him otherwise. He was still alive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After who knew how long, Jiang Chen forced his eyes open with a struggle, but found himself in a coffin.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In a coffin? Then I’m really dead?</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;How depressing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How laughable. I, Jiang Chen, son of the Celestial Emperor, was born with a yin constitution and thus couldn’t cultivate. Even though father refined the Sun Moon Pill so that I could live as long as the universe, I still became father’s burden and succumbed when the cataclysm descended from the heavens….</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Eh? What’s going on with my meridians? There’s true qi flowing through them?! It’s rather weak… wait! This… this isn’t my body, this is definitely not my body! I was born with a yin constitution, so how could I have true qi present in my body?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And, if I’m really dead, how could there be energy flowing through my body?” An electrical jolt sizzled through Jiang Chen’s brain as he laid in the coffin. At the same time, he realized that the body lying in the coffin didn’t belong to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This… what’s this? Whose body is this?” This unexpected discovery brought both surprise and joy. He quickly discovered a few fragments of memory in the body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“This body’s owner was also called Jiang Chen? The son of the duke of the Jiang Han province in the Eastern Kingdom? The name is right, but this is obviously not me! I am the son of the almighty Celestial Emperor - how did I become the scion of such a mundane kingdom?” Jiang Chen’s mind was filled with questions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Did I really die in the cataclysm? Is this the fabled reincarnation? The heavens were shattered and the wheel of life smashed... I should’ve been annihilated with no hope of traveling along the wheel of life! So… I... really reincarnated?” Jiang Chen finally confirmed this new reality after perusing the fragments from the past Jiang Chen’s consciousness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“To think that I was the exalted son of the Celestial Emperor in my past life, yet barred from cultivating due to my yin constitution. And now that I’ve reincarnated into the noble son of such a humdrum kingdom, I’ve gained the potential to cultivate... Oh the irony!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The heavens were shattered and order crumbled… I lived a million years in vain in my past life. I died with the sun and moon and couldn’t offer any help when disaster arrived. A yin constitution cannot cultivate and thus is doomed to always be at the mercy of others. My fate was like that of a floating speck of dust - easily dispelled as the wind blew.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Chen grew somber, lost in his thoughts as he thought of his past life, and of his father who’d developed the Sun Moon Pill at an incredible cost, so that his son’s mortal body could enjoy life as long as the sun and moon’s.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that this life and death separation was possibly an eternal farewell!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though he’d lived a million years, even though he possessed great intelligence - when he thought of his father painstakingly taking care of him, hot tears spilled out of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew the heavens were shattered. Even if one was as almighty as the Celestial Emperor, it was almost impossible to survive. Jiang Chen grew upset as his thoughts traveled to the end of this path.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, a bolt of thunder crashed into his soul when he touched upon his body’s meridians. It was like a man dying of thirst finding a sweet spring! The slowly moving true qi was so weak, weak to the point of almost flickering out. But it was this fragile hint of true qi that stoked his flames of life and swept away depressing thoughts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cultivate? Heh, cultivation! This was ludicrous for someone with a yin constitution like mine. I couldn’t train in my past life, but never bowed to fate. Now that I’ve gained this potential due to reincarnation, the door of fate has cracked open for me!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As the exalted son of the Celestial Emperor, I held charge of the Tianlang Library for millions of years. I perused countless books and scrolls, and am familiar with all disciplines and methods of cultivation. I was renowned for pill dao, but my knowledge was forever halted at a theoretical, abstract level. Now that I’ve gained the ability to cultivate, what cause have I to fear? For what reason would I bow my head in defeat?” Jiang Chen felt a weight lift off his shoulders as he explored this line of reasoning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The previous negative emotions slowly dissipated. This reincarnation was a turning point that would interminably change his life!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Indeed, from the perspective of his past life, being an ordinary noble son was completely inconsequential. But even the lowliest person possessed one quality that he hadn’t in his past life, and that was the ability to cultivate!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The qualification to cultivate was the starting line of a race.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he had been as lofty as dragons and phoenixes in his past life, he had only ever been able to watch from the sidelines. Now, despite his commonness and being like an ant in his new life, he could step up to the starting line and take his place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The path of cultivation was ceaseless and boundless. If one was so fortunate, golden carps could transform to dragons and the lowest of bugs could soar in the heavens. And now, an opportunity had come!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Son of the Celestial Emperor, Keeper of the Tianlang Library. He had devoted millions of years almost entirely to studying. It was no exaggeration to say that he was a walking encyclopedia and grasped the world’s knowledge in his hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His belly full of theories spanning from the heavens to common dirt, there was no topic that Jiang Chen was unfamiliar with. Although he hadn’t been able to cultivate in the many boring years of his past life, he loved to take disciples and conduct experiments with them, testing out one theory or another. He’d lost track of how many prodigies he’d created in his lifetime.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What was opportunity?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d reincarnated with the memories of Jiang Chen, son of the Celestial Emperor, and had gained the body of Jiang Chen, an unfortunate dukedom heir. The experiments he had conducted via his disciples could finally now be acted out with his own hands!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was opportunity!</span></p>

A striking crash sounded at this moment, like something had slipped and smashed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crash!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Jiang Ying, figure it out! Find out at all costs!” Jiang Feng, the duke of Jiang Han, flung a vase furiously, wanting to burn down the kingdom in his rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your Lordship, we already have a clue.” Jiang Ying spoke respectfully, dressed from head to toe in black. “Although the young master wasn’t diligent in training, he was still a cultivator of the true qi level. His control over his body is absolute. In the face of such an important occasion, he wouldn’t have lost control and passed gas.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then someone else is behind all this? Someone wanted to intentionally embarrass Chen’er during the Rites of Heavenly Worship, so that he would enrage the king and be executed?” Jiang Feng’s tone descended to a dangerous point.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The young master ate breakfast with friends at the Autumn Crane this morning. I didn’t discover anything when I investigated the tavern, but found traces of “Three Laugh Powder” in the young master’s body.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three Laugh Powder?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jiang Feng’s face darkened, how would he not know what that was? It cleared up a person’s internal passages and while it didn’t have any side effects, it caused a person’s qi to sink through their body and be expelled from all parts of the body. His son’s damnable gas emission that’d sent the king into a rage during the Rites hadn’t come out of nowhere, it was definitely due to this “Three Laugh Powder”!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So it wasn’t a coincidence. This was a devious, premeditated plot!” Jiang Feng easily came to this conclusion after connecting the dots.</span></p>

He ordered the boy’s corpse hung on the city wall for vultures and scavengers to pick at. Jiang Chen wouldn’t even have a body left if the other nobles hadn’t persuade the king otherwise, pointing out that open display of a corpse was vulgar and uncivilized, and would adversely impact the kingdom’s fortunes.</span></p>
