<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 374: Unprecedented, Level Five Mission</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was rather satisfied by this point accumulation rate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, what he didn’t know was that his title as a freak genius had made the rounds among all the pill area examiners overnight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the examiners had heard of his phenomenal accomplishments by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d beaten the proud and unbridled Tang Hong in a bet, and the latter was now wholeheartedly become the freak genius’ follower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d crashed through a level two mission as if splitting bamboo, completing it in fifteen minutes when allotted two hours, and completed it in stunning fashion, with no flaws to be found at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d then displayed divine potential in the third mission; Eight examiners had used 32 hours to finish simulating a mission, but he’d used only two hours to thoroughly do so by himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this if not divine-class potential?</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jiang Chen appeared again the next day, he was greeted by the complicated gaze from an examiner. There were hints of appraisal in the examiner’s eyes, as well as subtle traces of anticipation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What level mission? Four?” When Jiang Chen handed over his candidate token, the examiner responded warmly and enthusiastically, without even waiting for him to speak.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had indeed intended to request a level four mission, but found it rather strange when the examiner asked him like this. The examiners swapped out every day, and their constantly changing reactions threw Jiang Chen for a loop.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The difficulty of the fourth level mission had indeed increased by quite a bit once again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen returned to the main entrance four hours later and handed over his mission token.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Level four mission, success!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His successful challenge of a level four mission spread throughout the entire sky quadrant in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A secular cultivator had accomplished such stunning feats in the sky quadrant, becoming the second to complete a level four mission since the beginning of the exams!</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it were the original person who’d completed a level four mission, people may not have put much thought into it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But this feat had been achieved by a secular cultivator! This drew quite a bit of suspicion and disbelief in these results.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Level four pill mission?” Long Juxue also thought it incredible when she received this news. “How could that dumb animal’s potential in spirit medicine have increased so much, so quickly?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her thoughts traveled back to the Hidden Dragon Trials of the Eastern Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She remembered how the Pill King Garden had once attempted to usurp the Hall of Healing’s position and held an exhibition, trying to slap the latter’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, ultimately the Hall of Healing had hit back soundly in return, introducing a few pills that completely destroyed the Pill King Garden and causing it to disband.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This matter had stunned the capital back then, and naturally Long Juxue had been aware of it as well. However, no one knew what brought that about.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that the pills the Hall of Healing had marketed at that time had come from Jiang Chen?” Long Juxue suddenly felt enlightenment dawn on her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why did the Third Hallmaster Qiao Baishi of the Hall of Healing harden his resolve to associate with Jiang Chen, even though he was the successor to the Hall? Was it really because of Jiang Chen’s potential in pills?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more Long Juxue thought about this, the more likely she thought it to be. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That dumb beast has hidden himself rather well. I hadn’t imagined that his potential in the area of pills is so high. Could it be that his mysterious backer truly is spirit king protector Ye Chonglou of the Skylaurel Kingdom?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Ye Chonglou wasn’t someone of the Precious Tree Sect, he had a myriad of connections with the sect. If he had truly started raising Jiang Chen since young and focused on pills, then everything laid out before her would have a reasonable explanation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whenever Long Juxue heard Jiang Chen’s name now, it felt like a thousand, nay, ten thousand vipers gnawing on her heart. It was incredibly unsettling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her deep, burning hatred made her itch to immediately destroy Jiang Chen and scatter his ashes to the four winds after burning him to the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph. Talent in the dao of pills is still an unconventional side path in the end. Even if he can deploy this potential to the utmost, it’ll never be able to measure up to my advantage of an innate constitution.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue had great confidence in her azure phoenix constitution. The overbearing atmosphere now present in her bearing was something that had been accumulated over time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, I’ll let you strut around for now. You best not let me select you in the challenges. When that day comes, it will be your last on this earth. Go and have your little fun for a few days!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chilling killing intent suffused Long Juxue’s hate filled eyes, akin to the passage of autumn to the arrival of bitter winter as the surrounding temperature plummeted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, boss, big happenings, big happenings! You’re now a celebrity in the sky quadrant!” Tang Hong grinned and laughed loudly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is being a celebrity a good thing? Someone’s just trying to set me up as the public enemy. There’s nothing good about it. Haven’t you seen that those preeminent sect disciples are all the very epitome of a low profile?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong chuckled, “They are they and you are you. Those fellows like to flaunt a mysterious air and pretend that they’re all that. You’re my boss and so you should be a bit more arrogant. You’ve got the skills and talent and so you should put those sons of b*tches in their place! They need to stop acting like idiots with eyes on the top of their heads that don’t look properly at anyone!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was evident that Tang Hong was quite disdainful towards those premier experts. This was the core reason why he’d been unable to become part of the most select social circles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forget it, I have no desire to compete with anyone right now. My most important mission currently is to grind out points. Everything is as fleeting as the winds if I don’t raise my score.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no point in erupting in full hostility before the moment to battle arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, are you really going to challenge the level five mission tomorrow?” Tang Hong rubbed his hands and changed the subject.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yep.” Jiang Chen answered shortly and simply nodded his head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh heh, then things will be even more fun tomorrow. No one’s requested a level five mission in the pill area thus far. Boss, you’re heaven-defying! No matter whether or not you succeed, this step will absolutely own all your opponents.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong kept rubbing his hands in excitement and his eyes gleamed when he thought about the scenario at hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it’d been anyone else requesting a level five mission, Tang Hong’s first thought would’ve been—an idiot seeking death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His second thought would’ve been—the hell does it have to do with me?</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Jiang Chen was different. Jiang Chen was his boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong had an almost blind faith in Jiang Chen at this point. One had to know that despite with Tang Hong’s potential, he’d never challenged a level four mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But boss was going to challenge a level five mission and set a new record in the sky quadrant!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong wasn’t the only one making these speculations. The entire sky quadrant was discussing whether or not the secular genius would really challenge a level five mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A level five mission!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a mission that that even the most preeminent geniuses didn’t dare attempt, despite reward of 160 points upon completion being quite alluring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the same thing applied both ways. If he failed, he would be docked 160 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prior to attempting the level four mission, he’d already had 160 points. Now that he’d completed it and been rewarded with 80 points, he had 240 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This score was past the minimum requirement for requesting a level five mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a few days of hard work, Jiang Chen’s score had passed the minimum requirement of 160 points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong scratched his ears and head and sat for a bit, then remained there for a bit more. He appeared quite fidgety and brash. He sometimes had a lively expression on his face, and at times mumbled to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked like this perverse genius of the Precious Tree Sect had long since grown used to life as Jiang Chen’s follower, and would be so worked up about his boss’ affairs that he wouldn’t be able to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This night was quite long for Tang Hong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He arrived early next day to find Jiang Chen and watch over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen found it funny when he saw Tang Hong’s intensely anxious attitude. Challenging a level five mission was a simple matter for Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But to Tang Hong, this was an incredible, earth-shaking and heaven-shattering matter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, it was a monumental event for the entire sky quadrant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, take a few deep breaths in and don’t be too nervous. Remember, this is a level five mission. It’s no joke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong chuckled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The hell am I nervous about? What’s there to be nervous about?” Jiang Chen hadn’t been nervous at all. Thanks to Tang Hong fooling around, it actually looked like Jiang Chen was putting on a front.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re really not nervous? Boss is boss alright. This is a transaction of 160 points! You gain 160 points if you win, but if you lose, you’ll be back in poverty when your points are docked.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having lower than 100 points in the sky quadrant was absolute poverty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But in Jiang Chen’s heart, he’d never even considered failure. The level four mission had still been completed with ease last time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then using the difficulty of the level four mission as a barometer, even if the level five was double of that, it would still be no challenge to Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I take home 160 points, then my total score will be 400 points.” Jiang Chen’s heart was full of longing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>400 points was indeed nothing in the eyes of the higher level candidates. But to Jiang Chen, this was an exceedingly good starting point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had to keep grinding out points in the pill area until his points were greater than a thousand. He could even look forward to two thousand points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the other geniuses were also grinding out points in their strong areas, no one was a bigger cheat than Jiang Chen in the sky quadrant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The others could gain points because of their superior strength and their unique advantages in the sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Jiang Chen’s gains were based on using the memories and experiences of his past life. This was something that no one else would have apart from him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could use a single move to take everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was evident that the exams of the sky quadrant were used to uncover geniuses in any areas.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them had arrived at the pill examination area as they chatted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rumors were flying thickly in the outside world that he was about to challenge the level five mission. There were many gathered to witness the show and take in the means of this challenge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, there were at least double the number of disciples here than normally present.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw Jiang Chen appear in the lobby, things became quite lively. The star of the show was here! This was good news for those waiting to watch the show.</span></p>
