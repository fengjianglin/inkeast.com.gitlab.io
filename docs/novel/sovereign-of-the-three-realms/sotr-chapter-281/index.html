<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 281: The Purple Sun Sect’s Decision</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Jiang Chen’s name was quite famous within the sixteen kingdoms, apart from within the Skylaurel Kingdom, anything that was known about Jiang Chen had all been built on rumors.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since it was just rumors and gossip, many were still refused to accept Jiang Chen deep within their hearts. They didn’t believe the rumors, feeling that they painted a picture of Jiang Chen larger than life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, at this moment, the vice heads and sect head of three sects were setting aside their identities and openly extending invitations towards Jiang Chen in front of everyone! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The most crucial thing was, theoretically speaking, their actions weren’t against the rules.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The rules said that no cheating was allowed after the first selection had started.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t say that the sects couldn’t recruit before the first selection started. It was right and proper if someone recognized value where it lay right then and was willing to use rich rewards to recruit someone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Xie Tianshu felt a bit awkward, he was the head of a sect after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After being pressured by Wang Tuo and Jiang Ruo, he smiled faintly, “A treasured blade’s edge is honed through repeated sharpening, plum blossoms that make it through winter smell even more fragrant. Although Jiang Chen has met some setbacks in the Skylaurel Kingdom, my sect was thinking of the greater picture and wanted to go to greater depths to test him. Reality has also proven that Jiang Chen is indeed suitable for the Precious Tree Sect, and is worthy of the sect recruiting him at all costs.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>At all costs. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>These were solemn words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo and Jiang Ruo looked at each other, seeing worry in each other’s eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the Precious Tree Sect was willing to do whatever necessary to recruit Jiang Chen, then their offers wouldn’t be able to compete with that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, Jiang Chen’s foundations were in the Skylaurel Kingdom, his connections lay there as well. If the Precious Tree Sect paid no heed to the cost in recruiting him, then they would have a great advantage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo grew worried, “Jiang Chen, you have such extraordinary potential in raising spirit creatures, and can be described as a rare genius that comes around once in a thousand years. The Myriad Spirit Sect alone is the most suitable sect for you. The Precious Tree Sect allowed you to languish in the shadows, not only not helping you, but suppressing you all around as well. How is that the proper attitude towards a genius?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Ruo didn’t back down either, “Jiang Chen, perhaps your potential isn’t limited to just raising spirit creatures. Our Flowing Wind Sect is most adept at unearthing hidden talents. Perhaps there are other potentials and great powers hidden within you. Only the Flowing Wind Sect within the sixteen kingdoms can uncover the utmost limit of your potential.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone’s words made sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They each emphasized their advantages and were extravagantly florid with their words, as if flowers were raining from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jiang Chen’s prime target was the Precious Tree Sect. He was participating in the selection because of that sect’s spirit medicine resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Myriad Spirit Sect was quite strong in training spirit creatures, he didn’t think that he’d be able to learn much from them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was true that the Flowing Wind Sect was skilled at unearthing potential, but Jiang Chen was well aware where his potential lay and was even more so aware of his advantages.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His worry wasn’t how to unearth his capabilities, but that he had too many of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the Purple Sun Sect, it never entered Jiang Chen’s consideration, no matter how he looked at things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he’d long since decided on the Precious Tree Sect, he didn’t intend to declare his tendencies at the moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>To do so now would make the Precious Tree Sect think less of him, and think that he was only worth this much. They had only asked offhandedly, and he had come running as soon as they’d beckoned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This didn’t fit Jiang Chen’s personality.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he were to enter a sect, they would have to be fighting each other for the honor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sect head putting in an appearance?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen didn’t give a rat’s ass about that at all. </span><i><span style>You’re the head of the sect alright, but isn’t it too late for you to express your sincerity now?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Where were you when the Iron family was making trouble for me again and again?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>You want me to run to you with gratitude now that you’ve come and shown your old face?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Think again!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Since the master of the Precious Tree Sect was forefather Thousandleaf, then he was the one who had to extend the invite!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, Jiang Chen didn’t want to give rise to rumors that he’d entered the sect using a backdoor.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>I, Jiang Chen, can enter the sect on the basis of my own strength. What need have I for you, Xie Tianshu, to play the good guy now?</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>…….</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Over where the forefathers were, apart from Sunchaser, the other three were in a stunning accord with what was transpiring over there. No one stood out to object. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It would’ve been ludicrous had the three forefathers stepped out to fight over a mundane disciple. Even though Jiang Chen had already left an impression on them, things had yet to progress to the final stage of the selection. With their positions as an origin realm forefathers, they wouldn’t step out to fight over a disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though Jiang Chen’s performance was quite stunning and had made some eye-catching moves, showing off some extraordinary potential, but at their current stage on the path of martial dao, they had seen too much already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They had seen too many geniuses with potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet how many of those had been able to make it to the origin realm in the end?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the four of them had appeared in nearly a thousand years.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they thirsted for talent, they still trusted only their eyes as proof and wished to observe the true talents of the various geniuses through the first selection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser from the Purple Sun Sect wrinkled his brow slightly when he saw this scene. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The other three had sent their sect head or vice heads, and only the senior executives of the Purple Sun Sect were notable in their absence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made forefather Sunchaser feel a bit disgruntled.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Even if you don’t care about this young man, at least put on an act? Four hundred thousand ordinary disciples represent four hundred thousand pairs of eyes.</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>What will they think of our sect when they see how enthusiastic the other three are towards this young man?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>People could possibly think that the Purple Sun Sect was too arrogant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zixu, what’s going on over there?” Sunchaser couldn’t help but send a mental message to Purple Sun Sect head Spiritual Master Zixu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spiritual Master Zixu also felt quite awkward when he witnessed this scene.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that he didn’t want to recruit Jiang Chen, but once he heard of the feud between Jiang Chen and his sect’s Shuiyue faction, he resigned himself to give up on that notion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This Jiang Chen had come from the Eastern Kingdom and had a death feud with the Long Juxue genius of the Shuiyue faction!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard the name “Long Juxue”, Zixu knew that there was no hope for Jiang Chen to enter the sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it’d been less than two years since Long Juxue entered the sect, Master Shuiyue had used a monumental amount of effort to push Long Juxue from the peak of true qi master to the earth spirit realm half a month ago!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue, a genius girl less than twenty years old, was already in the earth spirit realm!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t to say that the Purple Sun Sect lacked geniuses with this level of training, but Long Juxue was different. She’d entered the sect only less than two years ago. Her rate of improvement was truly the definition of leaps and bounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The advantage of the azure phoenix constitution beneath the attentive care of the sect pushed Long Juxue forward at such a rate that the other preeminent geniuses within the sect could only tsk in amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though her level of training wasn’t in the lead of the geniuses within the sect, her potential laid bare. Everyone was well aware that the second selection was three years long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In these three years, Long Juxue’s level of training was certain to see a significant increase!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Shuiyue’s expectations for her were the peak of the earth spirit realm at the lowest, meaning the sixth level spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And that was only her lowest estimate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With such incredible potential like the azure phoenix constitution, if she had enough resources and fortuitous encounters within these three years, it was possible that she could break through to the sky spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She could even continue further into the sky spirit realm as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The azure phoenix constitution, a genius found once in hundreds of years, was practically born for the martial dao. Her potential, her powers of comprehension, her bloodline - they all enabled her to take to any technique and method like a fish in water. Once she successfully practiced them to perfection, her power would also far exceed that of her peers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Long Juxue was now only at the fourth level spirit realm, the executives of the Purple Sun Sect had long since listed her as one of the six most likely to make it into the final sixteen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from Long Juxue, the other five were almost all at the peak of the earth spirit realm, even with those incredible existences of the sky spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue was only at the fourth level spirit realm and was treated as on par with the premier geniuses within the sect. From this, it was obvious how extraordinary her potential was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because of this that when Spiritual Master Zixu heard of the death feud between Jiang Chen and Long Juxue, he had given up the idea of recruiting Jiang Chen without a further thought. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Jiang Chen had a great reputation lately, from Zixu’s perspective a few talented tricks still paled far in comparison to Long Juxue’s azure phoenix constitution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zixu could only answer honestly when the forefather asked him, “Forefather, Jiang Chen and Long Juxue of the azure phoenix constitution both hail from the Eastern Kingdom and a death feud exists between them. One mountain cannot hold two tigers, so our sect can only give up on this Jiang Chen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser immediately understood once he heard this explanation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He mentally put Jiang Chen on his blacklist. If he had a feud with Long Juxue, then he was the Purple Sun Sect’s enemy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even Sunchaser had to admit that Long Juxue’s potential made him want to take her as a true disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was merely waiting for Long Juxue to emerge from the masses during this time’s great selection before taking her as a true disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In this regard, Sunchaser’s mentality grew detached, and he settled on the attitude of watching a good show as he watched the three sects fight one another. He was quite disdainful of them. </span><i><span style>Is it worth fighting over someone destined to die?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I say, you three, to send out your sect head and vice heads to recruit a mere mundane disciple, don’t you think you are raising a great fuss over nothing and damaging the repute of your sects?” Sunchaser chuckled. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninelion from the Myriad Spirit Sect barked out a laugh. “Old monster Sunchaser, don’t take such a high and mighty tone. Who doesn’t know that Jiang Chen has a death feud with one of your geniuses and thus you can’t take him. What are you acting so aloof for?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninelion’s personality was a bit disagreeable as he mercilessly exposed Sunchaser’s sham. &nbsp;</span></p>
