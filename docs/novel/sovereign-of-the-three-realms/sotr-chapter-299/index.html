<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 299: The Disappearance of the Magnetic Golden Mountain</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the Lord of the Golden Seal had thought through things, then this blow with ten percent of his strength was following the rules of the original master.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he didn’t follow the rules and went against his master’s will, the Lord of the Golden Seal would immediately be wiped out and his consciousness dispersed, only able to passively wait till the next time he awoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Legs as thick as columns charged forward, stomping heavily on the ground. The entire mountain seemed to tremble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Watch my blow!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The being’s muscular arms threw out a punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although there was only ten percent of the being’s strength in that blow, it still encompassed the essence of the mountain, freezing even the air around Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen only felt that a mountain was charging forward at him, a mountain that bristled with gleaming blades.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Laughing wryly, he had to admit that the strength of the Lord of the Golden Seal was incredible indeed. But if he’d decreased the level of his strength to ten percent, the power behind this punch was still something that a third level spirit realm would be able to handle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six lotuses formed a neat blockade as their petals seemed to form layers of tenacious barriers of air, holding up beneath the brunt of the fist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The six lotuses bent backwards beneath the force of the invincible punch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the flexible petals still fully blocked the entirety of the strong fighting aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As strong as the Lord of the Golden Seal was, the Bewitching Lotus of Fire and Ice wasn’t ranked among the top five of all plant spirits for nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it's currently evolved state was lower than that of the Lord of the Golden Seal, it was six against one now, and the golden being had only used ten percent of its strength in this blow. So although the Lotus was currently a bit weaker, it didn’t suffer any damage. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord of the Golden Seal looked at the six lotuses, then raised its fist and looked at it, shock written all over his face. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, there’s something odd about your lotuses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled. “Don’t underestimate this Lotus. If it evolves into its final form, then even you at your peak may not be its match.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the Lotus was to evolve to its final form, even the supreme experts of all planes of existence would find it to be a thorny opponent. But this Lord of the Golden Seal was just a spirit creature on the magnetic golden mountain. When their ultimate forms faced off, it truly wasn’t a match for the Lotus.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That strong?” The Lord of the Golden Seal asked in amazement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Bewitching Lotus of Fire and Ice can rank amongst the top five of all plant spirits. How strong do you think it is?” Jiang Chen chuckled as he countered with a question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Top five?” The Lord of the Golden Seal was flabbergasted. It murmured, “Jiang Chen, you really are a perverse existence. You don’t seem like a third level spirit realm practitioner at all. Some origin realm practitioners may not even know as much as you, nor have such quality equipment as you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was indifferent. “The magnetic heart?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord of the Golden Seal threw back its head and said loudly, “Don’t worry, since you’ve passed the test, the mountain is immediately passed down onto you according to the will of the original master. The magnetic heart is here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord of the Golden Seal suddenly extended its arms. They started endlessly transforming amidst shimmering golden lights and had transformed into two sharp swords after a short while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Open!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It waved its arms and the swords turned into flashes of golden light, slicing into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A crack slowly formed and continued to grow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden light shot to the heavens from the crack, like the golden rays of the sun spilling out over the earth, bathing one with an exceedingly holy feeling. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The being’s arms pointed upwards as the golden light dissipated into mist and continued to rise. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A golden item the size of a goose egg slowly rose from the ground into the mist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!” The Lord of the Golden Seal pointed its arms. The golden item turned into a beam of light as it shot towards Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen mobilized the lotuses to secure this item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The magnetic heart?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Lord of the Golden Seal nodded. “The mountain is yours after refining this magnetic heart. You will inherit it and can manipulate it as you will. It can be big or small and answers to your thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Joy crept over Jiang Chen’s face. He’d striven so hard for so long and had finally welcomed the moment in which the magnetic heart appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The organizers of the third trial were rather bored.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Six to seven days had passed. Most of the candidates had either been disqualified, or had no strength to continue on after the fifth level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of course, the numbers of people who exited didn’t quite match up to the numbers that had entered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, those who hadn’t made it out by now was very unlikely to emerge, unless they continued moving forward and continuously assailed the highest peak of the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, according to the knowledge of the organizers, these ordinary practitioners basically had no possibility of taking another step further after making it to the eighth level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve heard that the freak of the boulder’s heart has yet to emerge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘Indeed, it’s the seventh day already. If he still hasn’t come out, he should’ve made it to the ninth level by now. The magnetic storms of the ninth level are quite frightening. Ai, I hope such a great genius doesn’t fall in the magnetic storms.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I doubt it. A genius is a genius and is born with immense luck. Didn’t someone say he would die in the cavern of the vein of skyfire? And what now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s true. A true genius is different from the masses. If this freak of the boulder’s heart is really that kind of genius, he will possess his own kind of luck and won’t fall that easily.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Right, so let’s wait patiently. Before the deadline of ten days, what happens inside is a mystery. The mountain will automatically bounce him out if he’s still alive after ten days. If he died within the mountain, then the so-called genius was just a shooting star.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ai, the sixteen kingdoms have been quiet for so long with nothing exciting happening in the four sects. How many years has it been since such a perverse genius has appeared? I really don’t want such a good seed to fall just like this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who knows? It looks like there’s less than twenty thousand left after this third trial?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A beam of golden light filled the void betwixt the sky and heavens as they were talking. It lit up the skies, piercing everyone’s eyes so that no one could open them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone closed their eyes involuntarily and didn’t dare take a direct look, as if the golden light was ending the world.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam crash thud!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Enormous thuds, on the order of heaven and earth collapsing, rang out as if countless gods were cavorting about in the heavens, or thunder and lightning had begun to rampage wildly across the skies. Lightning flashed and thunder cracked, as explosions continuously shattered the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That golden light that accompanied the noise become brighter and brighter, lighting up everything. It felt like that the golden glow was the only color left in the world, and no one dared open their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>in that moment, even the forefathers felt that armageddon had arrived. Their bodies seemed to be lonely rafts afloat in a raging ocean, buffeted to and fro as their fortunes were wrested from their control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There seemed to be an invisible force, coiling around them, hobbling their footsteps and shackling their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Magnetic force?” The forefathers were privately astonished. How could they not know this feeling!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous magnetic force gave them the impression that their bodies, their very lives weren’t under their own control.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on?” Sunchaser’s face darkened and was about to open his eyes to take a look when the terrifying golden light seemed to pierce towards his eyes like sharp swords.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A sense of danger swept him as he immediately closed his eyes, not daring to face this light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other forefathers, shocked, &nbsp;were also in similar circumstances. However, in this situation, they were powerless to do anything and could only activate all their defenses, protecting their sect and probing about with their consciousness, trying to sense what was going on.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the golden light seemed to have swallowed everything. No matter how far or deep their consciousness probed, all they could sense was a hazy mist of golden light, an unformed world of chaos without any clues or hints at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a good thing that this golden light wasn’t maintained for long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After fifteen minutes, it started to slowly fade and disappear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The immense oppressive feeling also faded from around the forefathers. Everything was as usual when they’d opened their eyes again. All of the organizers were also crawling out of various corners with looks of shock and astonishment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from everyone’s expression, no one knew what had happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, an organizer looked dead ahead as his entire face twisted, the muscles on his face twitching rapidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He extended a finger and pointed ahead as if he’d seen a ghost, “Look… look. Everyone, hurry and look. Look…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look what? A ghost?” An ill-tempered organizer beside him followed his colleague’s finger with his gaze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh, where’s the Endless Mountain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The magnetic golden mountain disappeared!” The organizer who’d sneered at the other for having seen a ghost now also looked like he’d seen a ghost as he started crying out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone looked to the front after hearing these words, with their expressions becoming unified as they did so. Everyone looked like they’d seen a ghost.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magnetic golden mountain, that towering and boundless mountain had truly disappeared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everything was flat to the eye, as if there had never been any mountain!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if a god had moved away that awe inspiring, endless mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s happened? Was that golden light the dismantlement of the mountain?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s crazy! What kind of power would make the magnetic golden mountain fall to pieces?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can it really be a god that had descended and moved the mountain away?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The organizers discussed hotly, filled with shock, confusion, and befuddlement. They’d never heard of anything like this, much less seen anything like it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A towering mountain had disappeared, just like that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>How great must one’s arts have been to move such a mountain?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the forefathers had likely never heard of anything like this, much less the others present?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The stronger one became the more one trained in martial dao, that was true.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, to destroy a small mountain in one blow, even the forefathers likely couldn’t do this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But to move a towering mountain away, even the forefathers couldn’t do so if their strength increased tenfold!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Moving mountains and shifting seas, chasing the stars and stealing the moon, those arts only existed in legends.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even origin realm practitioners couldn’t do so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, where was the magnetic golden mountain? If no one had moved it away, then where had it gone?</span></p>
