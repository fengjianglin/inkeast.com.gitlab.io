<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 309: Fire For a Hundred Li</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thousands of Fire Ravens were all at least at the first level spirit realm, and their stronger brethren were even at the third, fourth level spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When all these Fire Ravens released their spirit power in unison and flapped their flaming wings, the enormous spirit power formed a large wave and made the trees on that mountain face quickly wither, shrivel, turn into ash and dust at a speed that could be visibly observed by the human eye. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Waves of hot air beat down on Jiang Chen even from afar, making him feel like countless needles were stabbing into him in an exceedingly uncomfortable fashion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since these Fire Ravens have released their spirit power and formed this fire attribute force field, it means that they are surely summoning their leader. It looks like the king of the Fire Ravens is about to appear.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was privately astonished. The destructive abilities of a couple thousand fire ravens were vastly superior to the million strong Swordbird Army he’d possessed previously!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, the Swordbirds were all mortal rank creatures equivalent to the human true qi realm. None of them had advanced to the spirit rank and were unable to form a strong spirit force field.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Naturally, their abilities were nothing compared to these spirit rank fire ravens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention that it was obvious the king of these fire ravens was about to emerge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chirp!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A desolate chirp broke through the air, as sharp as an arrow, full of boundless presence like it would break through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The might of this chirp from the king actually cause the mountains his subjects to cry out in response. The waves of response rolled and reverberated through the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s face immediately changed when he heard this voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From this presence alone, the fire raven king’s level of training was at least on par with the Goldbiter Rat King!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He could even judge from this stunning posture that this king was likely at the half step origin realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen didn’t know whether to be surprised or dejected now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He hadn’t thought that the struggle over this wondrous flower would give rise to such a large disturbance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, a crack suddenly appeared in the mountain face as a spray of stunning sparks spewed forth, shooting towards the red clouds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the red clouds churned and covered the skies, a Fire Raven King that was as large as one of the ancient elephants of old appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Raven King’s wingspan was quite astonishing. With his outstretched wings, he could encompass almost a small mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Raven King’s feathers were all red, and he seemed to be bathing in red flames as a red haze surrounded him. This made the king seem even more like the vermillion bird, one of the four mythical creatures, being reborn as his immensely awe-inspiring aura flared and ruled over all.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Chirp ——-</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Another long chirp rang out as the Fire Raven King shook his wings and took to the sky, forming a marvelous line and rising like an enormous pillar of flame. It was quite an impressive sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thousands of fire ravens below all began cawing excitedly, chirping and calling out as well, full of worship for their king.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like their king was their totem, their god.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen prayed inwardly when he saw this scene, “Go, hurry and leave. Take your children and descendants and go for a walk. I’ll be able to pick that flower if you give me even fifteen minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen still hadn’t lost hope. That kind of wondrous flower was something one could only wish to stumble upon within the sixteen kingdom alliance, and he was absolutely not willing to give it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he missed it, it would result in regret for a lifetime.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he also knew that even if he didn’t know the exact details behind this Raven King’s level of training, he knew that this wouldn’t be a character to antagonize lightly, judging from the Raven King’s presence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It would be an absolute disaster to provoke this Raven King, and the level of the repercussions wouldn’t be any less than when he’d been surrounded by the rat tide.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Children, the day in which the Cloudflame Flower blooms is the day in which this king assails the saint rank. But these disgusting, pathetic humans have dared to disturb the peace of the Valley of Destruction and even polluted our territory in this valley. Isn’t this hateful?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hateful!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do we kill them or not?!” The Fire Raven King continued to caw mightily.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill!” Thousands of ravens cried out in unison.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After entering the spirit rank, these ravens all had their own consciousness and spoke the ancient beast tongue.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The hairs on Jiang Chen’s body stood on end when he heard these words. He only had one thought in his mind, the practitioners in the valley were going to be in for it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen knew that the double provocations from the two batches of candidates had thoroughly infuriated the Fire Raven tribe. Even the Fire Raven King had been disturbed. It looked like a bloodbath was about to befall the humans currently in the Valley of Destruction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I command you, in my name as the Fire Raven King, all those within a hundred li must be set on fire. Even one li less than a hundred is unacceptable. All that who you pass must be turned to cinders!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Fire Raven King gave the order, full of severe majesty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fire for a hundred li…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fire for a hundred li, all turned to ashes!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of the Fire Ravens started wildly agitating in great excitement after hearing these words. All of the Fire Ravens shot out like loosed arrows in all directions after receiving their king’s order. They transformed into streaks of fireballs and started spreading out in the vicinity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s heart sank when he saw this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is bad, with the Fire Ravens’ fire spirit power, all the places that they cover will be turned to ash and cinders. Nothing will be left alive!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A strong sense of danger hit Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His first thought was to retreat, but he quickly dismissed the notion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obviously too late to retreat. The thousands of Fire Ravens had already spread out, and with their speed, a human on two legs would never outpace them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To run out at this moment was to become their living target and seeking death!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was strong, but he wasn’t strong enough to the point where he could afford to be chased to death by thousands of Fire Ravens at once, not to mention there was a king at the peak of the spirit rank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had heard the king earlier in that he was planning on using the Cloudflame Flower to assail the saint rank, the equivalent of the human origin realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As confident as he was, Jiang Chen didn't think that his training was enough to meet a Fire Raven King at the peak of the spirit rank in battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen wouldn’t have been so arrogant as to publicly meet the king in battle even in the outside world, not to mention this was the Fire Raven’s territory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Remain calm, I must remain calm.” Jiang Chen kept reminding himself. “I’m only courting death if I run out at this moment. All of the Fire Ravens have gone out at this moment, and I would run out straight into the middle of their operations. Even if the Fire Ravens don’t attack me, the fires burning within this hundred li will prevent my escape. They shouldn’t have discovered me hiding in here for now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s emotions became calmer the more dangerous the situation was.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d calmed himself in this moment between life and death. The only silver lining was that he was hidden in a stone crack a far distance from the mountain face and had yet to be discovered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was also that he possessed adept methods of concealment, otherwise the Raven King’s consciousness would’ve easily discovered a human even a far distance away from the mountain face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this time, the dire sounds of human cries and wails continuously traveled to Jiang Chen’s hearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These sounds were close and far, panicked or ghastly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah! What is this?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“They’re spewing fire! Oh, heavens, help! Someone help me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fire is just fire, but there’s fire on all sides, we’ve been surrounded!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Flee! Hurry and flee! We can’t be cut off by the fire or we’ll be dead without a doubt!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All sorts of sounds faded in and out, filtering into Jiang Chen’s consciousness through the Ear of the Zephyr.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen sighed, “What an undeserved catastrophe. These candidates may have no idea what the Cloudflame Flower is but have been unexpectedly gotten embroiled in this. What an unexpected misfortune.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that only practitioners outside of this hundred li area would have the hope of escaping. Otherwise, their king had said to set fire to a hundred li, and precisely a hundred li would go up in flames. No matter how fast they were, the candidates would never be faster than wingbeats of the Fire Ravens or the swiftness of the fires.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They’d be hard pressed to escape even if they grew wings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The thousands of fire ravens circling in the sky had completed cordoned off the surrounding area, and the fires were spreading faster and faster.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The momentum of the fires were akin to the tides, continuously pushing forward and expanding. A radius of a hundred li in the immediate area had been turned into a fiery ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fire had spread so quickly and ferociously that those who were caught up within it had no time to escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from humans, even other lifeforms trapped within the fires had no chance of escaping.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Various desperate wails and screams, numerous ghastly growls and furious roars were all futile in this world destroying fire ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had occupied high ground on this cliff and so the fires hadn’t made their way up yet. However, the direction had been set and the flames kept roaring upwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wave upon wave of hot air crashed into the cliff as if the tidewaters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from this situation, Jiang Chen’s hiding place would be engulfed soon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He raised his head to look up into the sky and saw that the Fire Raven King hadn’t moved. He’d remained hovering in mid air and exuded a boundless, severe countenance, as if releasing his majestic dignity upon his children and descendants.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn it, that king isn’t moving at all. I’ll be revealed if I move the slightest bit beneath his purview and he’ll discover me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen inwardly cursed the Raven King. He’d wanted to wait for him to move away and make use of the opportunity to pick the flower.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked like that’d been idiotic daydreams. The Raven King was obviously not leaving the Cloudflame Flower’s side and wouldn't let his precious item slip out of his sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Damn, at this rate, even if the king doesn’t discover me, I’ll be baked to a crisp by the heat waves.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen knew he’d be in great trouble if this continued.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The flames would burn for three days and nights once they started. However, Jiang Chen would’ve still been confident in making it out if the Raven King hadn’t been there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But since he was here, destructive attacks would quickly follow if Jiang Chen made the slightest move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the might of this king, Jiang Chen didn’t think he’d be able to withstand a blast of his flames.</span></p>
