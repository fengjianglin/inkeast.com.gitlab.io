 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er listened with rapt attention. Her heart leapt to her throat when Jiang Chen relayed his experiences on Winterdraw Island. She felt both pride and heartache for her beloved. He had overcome so many difficulties and dangers to come to her. How could she not be moved?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh right, Huang’er, didn’t you estimate that it’d take decades for you to reach half-step empyrean? What’s caused the dramatic growth in your cultivation after only a few years?” That was what Jiang Chen was most curious about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chen, after returning to my family, there wasn’t a day when I didn’t miss you greatly, so I threw myself into cultivation. For some reasons, I progressed at an unusual rate. Before I knew it, I had broken through great emperor and reached half-step empyrean.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Chen mused, “Your parents must be of remarkable bloodlines, and they passed down the best heritage to you. That’s why you have an unparalleled natural talent in martial dao.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even he marveled at the speed in which she had improved.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your cultivation has grown quickly as well, Brother Chen. You were first level emperor realm when I left, and now you’re already great emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, how can I say I’ve improved quickly when there’s you?” Jiang Chen said teasingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er giggled. “Perhaps my breakthroughs were to compensate for my lack of progress when I was in the human domain?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">During those years, she hadn’t improved much in martial dao, the main reason being the Generation Binding Curse hindering her cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">They’d been apart for years. Naturally they had a lot to talk about.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Chen sighed and brought up a new topic in a conflicted tone, “There’s something we need to talk about, Huang’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me, Brother Chen.” Her eyelashes fluttered when she noticed the heaviness in his voice. She looked up at him with eyes as tender as water.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“During my trials in the Eternal Spirit Mountain, I was set up and accidentally consumed an aphrodisiac. A woman saved me while I was under the influence, but I never knew who she was. It wasn’t until later that I learned she was Master Ye Chonglou’s disciple, Dan Fei, whom I met when I was in Skylaurel Kingdom. After she sacrificed her chastity to save me, she went missing. It was much later that I found out Lady Dan’er, whom Emperor Peafowl had taken under his wing, was Dan Fei. She gave birth to my daughter...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thought of hiding the affair from Huang’er had never crossed Jiang Chen’s mind. That said, he worried that she would be crushed by the knowledge.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a brief pause, Huang’er chuckled. “Are there any other affairs you haven’t told me about, Brother Chen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Chen smiled wryly. “Just that one. I’ve wronged you, Huang’er, but if I didn’t accept that responsibility, that would be a bigger betrayal to Dan Fei and Nian’er.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Nian’er?” she muttered. “Jiang Nian’er? That’s a pretty name. Brother Chen, were you worried that I’d be jealous?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He shook his head with a stilted smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She rested both her hands on his shoulders and met his gaze with adoring eyes. “There are countless men in the world, Brother Chen. Why do I love only you? You’re responsible, knowledgeable, and magnamious. There are a lot of things I greatly admire you for. Of course I won’t be the only one to fall for an extraordinary man like you. Dan Fei and the Ling sisters from Regal Pill Palace are all deeply in love with you as well. Doesn’t Sister Gouyu harbor romantic feelings for you too?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er was remarkably intelligent. She had been with Jiang Chen long enough to know how popular he was among women.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew all about Ling Bi’er’s and Ling Hui’er’s feelings. She’d even seen Ling Hui’er taking Jiang Chen’s hand and place it on her chest. She was very smart to not point these things out and just let them take through their natural courses. Even if Jiang Chen ended up falling for them, she wouldn’t judge him for that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Most women’s love was obsessively possessive. They wanted an extraordinary man to be theirs and theirs alone. Sometimes, it was too much to ask for.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er wasn’t a regular woman. Her love was purer and more selfless. It was beyond the self-serving love of the mortals. That was why she didn’t hold a grudge against Dan Fei; it was against her nature to be selfish.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Besides, Dan Fei had given away her innocence to Jiang Chen, but she left him afterwards instead of clinging to him. Huang’er respected her for that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t feel guilty, Brother Chen. If not for you, I would’ve lost my purpose in life like a wilted flower. You gave me the opportunity to start anew. You bring color to my life. I hope that there are more people at your side caring for and loving you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was overwhelmed by her love for him. She put her face to his chest, revelling in the heat of his masculinity. This was what happiness felt like. Nothing else mattered to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Chen put his arms around her and caressed her beautiful hair. “How high is Xiahou Zong’s cultivation, Huang’er?” he asked gently.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She trembled at the mention of Xiahou Zong. The man had caused her a lifetime of nightmares.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry, Huang’er. That name will soon disappear from Myriad Abyss Island. I’ll end this nightmare he put you in with my own hands.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er started. “Are you going to challenge Xiahou Zong, Brother Chen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don’t need to challenge him to eliminate him,” he responded in a dark tone. “I’m not stupid. I won’t attack House Xiahou head on before I attain the power to dominate them.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your martial dao potential is higher than his, Brother Chen. If all other factors were equal, he wouldn’t be able to rival you in power. But he was born into the Xiahou family, spoon-fed with the best resources and care. That’s why his cultivation is...”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t worry about hurting my feelings, Huang’er. Be honest with me. I have to gain a comprehensive understanding of House Xiahou.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That made Huang’er wonder. “I’ve never spoken about Xiahou Zong, Brother Chen. Did Yan Qingsang tell you about him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your cousin?” Jiang Chen smiled wryly. “He couldn’t be more opposed to me getting close to you. He’s unusually stubborn, that guy. He shoots me down everytime I bring you up. That guy sure is persistent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Then how did you know about Xiahou Zong?” Huang’er was curious.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I heard people talk about him after coming to Myriad Abyss Island. What’s more, his brother Xiahou Jing went to the human domain with his followers and caused a lot of damage. I wiped him out.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What? Did you say you wiped him out?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Chen paused. “What’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiahou Jing was one of the three great geniuses of his family. He ranked a little higher than Xiahou Xi, their representative to the festival this time. Though Xiahou Jing was a level below Xiahou Zong, he seemed unwilling to accept Xiahou Zong’s status in the family.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s right. His unwillingness to accept things was what prompted him to travel to the human domain in the first place. He and his followers established the Order of Wind and Cloud, leaving chaos in their wake. They almost left the human domain in shambles.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er was shocked. “Did you kill him, Brother Chen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I did. We would never have been able to come to a truce. I’ll finish what I started and kill every member of House Xiahou I encounter. If they fail to acknowledge their mistakes, I’ll erase the entire family from the Divine Abyss Continent one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He meant what he said. As long as Xiahou Zong lived, Jiang Chen was destined to have a bitter feud with House Xiahou.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er knew he was doing it all for her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Xiahou Zong is one of the most remarkable geniuses among the younger generation in the Ten Divine Nations. I hear that he’s breaking through mid empyrean realm during his closed door cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh?” Jiang Chen’s eyes lit up. His curiosity was piqued. If Xiahou Zong had only been first level or second level empyrean, the genius wouldn’t have really been a threat. But Xiahou Zong had broken through mid empyrean at such a young age. Now that was surprising!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Interesting.” Jiang Chen smiled lazily. “He actually&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">is</span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;good enough to be my opponent.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er was much more at ease upon seeing the relaxed expression on Jiang Chen’s face. He hadn’t lost his calm after knowing Xiahou Zong’s cultivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She knew her lover could triumph over people of higher realms, but she wanted him to be more cautious and take fewer risks on Myriad Abyss Island.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He may not succeed in breaking through mid empyrean, Brother Chen. You, on the other hand, will certainly be able to reach empyrean realm in a couple years. The cultivation gap between you and him will become increasingly smaller. I believe that once you’re in the same realm, you’ll easily win a fight against him.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, that’s only the first step. My ultimate goal is to destroy House Xiahou in order to eliminate any future threats and to rescue your parents.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Warmth bloomed in Huang’er’s heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Jiang Chen had never forgotten about her parents. A man’s love for a woman could be seen in not only his care for her, but also his attentiveness to everything she cared about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er’s biggest weakness was her parents.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">If he could rescue her parents from the Boundless Prison, there would be nothing tying her to House Yan. She’d only returned because she didn’t want her parents to suffer for her deeds. They had suffered enough already, she didn’t want to add to their burden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, Huang’er. Xiahou Zong’s cultivation is progressing quickly. I can’t fall behind. I’ll be cultivating in here the next few days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Huang’er looked owishly at him. “Didn’t you make a promise to Yan Qingsang, Brother Chen?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Haha, I have. But we have a month. I only need seven or eight days to locate the ores.”</span></p>

Otherwise I wouldn’t have been able to gain Yan Qingsang’s unconditional trust. After the festival, I’ll find a way to earn enough trust so that he takes me back to House Yan. I’m willing to work for House Yan to stay by your side.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Brother Chen...” Huang’er was deeply moved. She knew Jiang Chen was a proud man. It was against his nature to be ordered around by her family.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can’t rest unless I’m by your side, Huang’er. Moreover, if one day House Xiahou suddenly comes to take you away, I’ll be able to break you out. Even if I have to turn Eternal Divine Nation upside down, I will never let you become Xiahou Zong’s cultivation vessel.” Jiang Chen was quite determined.</span></p>

 <p>Here we have a trope that I absolutely <em>loathe</em> in wuxia/xianxia novels. All that tripe about a woman being smart/gracious enough that she would never seek to possess the man, that she was on another level where she's super generous.</p>
 <p>That.</p>
 <p>is.</p>
 <p>pure.</p>
 <p>utter.</p>
 <p>shite. of a wish fulfillment.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>I can deal with plot armor. I can deal with cockroach villains. I can deal with endless tournament/treasure arcs. But this? @@</p>
 <p>And doesn't this also make the woman incredibly shallow as well? Since she's so incredibly broad-minded, the next time someone comes along and ticks off the boxes of MC traits, she'll fall in love with them too? After all, pure love of this highest level is so holy, so spiritual, so selfless that's just about the meeting of souls and not about owning someone, isn't it?</p>
 <p>BLEAUGHAUSFHWUEHFAWEIUFHALH.&nbsp;</p>
