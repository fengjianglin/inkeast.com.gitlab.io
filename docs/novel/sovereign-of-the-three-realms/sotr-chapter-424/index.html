 <p><span style>[expand title="</span><b>Title Withheld</b><span style>"] </span><span style>Chapter 424: Eradicating Shuiyue, Enraging Sunchaser</span></p>
 <p><span style>[/expand]</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Shuiyue regained her focus when she heard the gasp of a near dead Elder Silverroc. Helplessness rose unabated in her heart. She couldn’t believe that Jiang Chen had improved so quickly!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The secular brat who’d been almost killed by Chu Xinghan in front of the Second Crossing so few years ago had progressed so rapidly? He’d killed two of the three ninth level spirit realm cultivators facing him in almost the blink of an eye!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now, her life was in danger as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A trace of regret truly flashed through her heart at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly felt that she’d paid too much of a price for one Long Juxue. She even had to pay the price of her life now!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shuiyue, you took part in slaughtering my clan and seizing the Hall of Healing, didn’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen turned to advance on Master Shuiyue now that he’d killed Elder Silverroc.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The bone club in his hand had unerringly locked onto Master Shuiyue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Shuiyue’s face was drained of all color. Her eyes roared back to life again after regret flashed by, displaying a crazed look. “Jiang Chen, I admit that you’re a genius, but so what? Today, I will perish together with you!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Perish together?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen snorted derisively, his eyes forming the Evil Golden Eye again. The golden light shot forth violently as it locked onto Master Shuiyue’s consciousness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Evil Golden Eye was most adept at destroying enemies when they’d lowered their guard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he’d destroyed Elder Silverroc, it had been because the elder had underestimated his opponent and hadn’t paid attention to the strength behind this art.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Shuiyue was now absentminded and distracted, a moment when her dao heart was the least stable.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen could tell with a glance, this was when an opponent’s mental defenses were the weakest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was when the Evil Golden Eye would find it the easiest to sneak in!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Shuiyue had already sunk into madness at this point, prepared to detonate her spirit ocean and take Jiang Chen down with her in a bloody battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She suddenly felt a tyrannical strength shoot through her eyes when the beam of golden light arrived and dived deep into her soul.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although she trained in the arts and techniques of ice, she too had a feeling of falling down to an icy cavern in this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She circulated her spirit ocean and realized that her consciousness seemed to have been locked. She couldn’t move her body according to her will!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This discovery scared Master Shuiyue witless as terror filled her eyes. She suddenly thought of Elder Long Luo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is bad! I’ve been hit by his demonic art!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A tragic shriek echoed through the air as Master Shuiyue thrashed to break free of the Evil Golden Eye’s restrictions. However, she had no idea what she’d fallen victim to and thus naturally couldn’t even speak of breaking free of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen laughed derisively as his body flashed once again, appearing with the bone club held aloft.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shuiyue, your biggest mistake in this life was to scout Long Juxue. Now let me send you on your way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Shuiyue’s still charming face was now filled with fear. Regret, fear, despair, and hatred formed a kaleidoscope of emotions in her heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Golden light flashed in front of her as Jiang Chen’s bone club arrived in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hold, scum!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A forbidding roar suddenly blasted through the air. The owner was a noticeable distance away, but had ripped through the void with his voice to ring next to Jiang Chen’s ears like a clap of thunder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Old monster Sunchaser!” Jiang Chen was entirely too familiar with this voice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Master Shuiyue’s soul had been confined by the Evil Golden Eye, she still possessed some of her consciousness and was elated to hear the forefather’s voice. She immediately whistled sharply a few times, calling out to him for help.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The origin realm forefather’s aura was indeed astonishing. Even though he was still a distance away, his roar had embodied the strength of his enormous true essence and had caused Jiang Chen’s attack to halt briefly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, if you dare touch a single hair on Shuiyue, I’ll hunt you down no matter what the cost!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser’s tone was urgent and brutal, but full of hidden concern.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Shuiyue was his subordinate, but also his forbidden pleasure. There had always been an inexplicable relationship between the two of them all along.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their seniority was different, so they couldn’t openly dual cultivate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, Shuiyue was Sunchaser’s most cherished and beloved. Their relationship was exceedingly hidden, and no one within the sect knew of this. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Sunchaser had emerged from his closed door cultivation just then, he’d felt unsettled, waves of unease cascading through him. When he questioned those around him carefully, he learned that Jiang Chen had escaped from the Eternal Spirit Mountain, directly charging to the Shangyang Kingdom, and that Master Shuiyue had even brought two elders with her to the Shangyang Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This news had greatly alarmed Sunchaser. He knew that his ill feeling was because Shuiyue had met with danger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, Sunchaser didn’t pause at all as he emptied the sect of senior executives and brought them all with him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He rushed to the Shangyang Kingdom with the fastest speed possible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser had already detected the situation when Jiang Chen had brought the bone club crashing down on Master Shuiyue, but sadly he was too far away. Incapable of rescuing of her, he could only resort to issuing a stern warning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Jiang Chen’s attack had been slowed, this didn’t decrease the killing intent in his heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>So what of an origin realm?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if he were to face Sunchaser’s rage the very next moment, Jiang Chen showed not the slightest iota of hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He shook his right arm and smashed down with the bone club.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It connected solidly with Master Shuiyue’s head, killing her instantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Master Shuiyue’s body crumpled, her eyes still staring straight at Jiang Chen, unaccepting of her death, dying with great regret. She couldn’t believe that she’d died in the moment that forefather Sunchaser had arrived to save her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How dare you, you lowly SCUM!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser felt like his heart and mind were splitting open when he saw this scene. He saw Master Shuiyue slowly fall, but couldn’t save her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He threw his head back and howled, his rage as crazed as the raging waves and thrashing seas of a heavenly storm. Like an unleashed tsunami, his fury covered the skies and shook the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen! I swear, here, today, if I do not strip you of your tendons, skin you alive, and burn your bones to ashes, I am less than human!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser had dominated the sixteen kingdom alliance for hundreds of years. Even the forefathers of the other sects didn’t dare kill those of the Purple Sun Sect in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Of all people, Jiang Chen had actually dared kill Shuiyue in front of him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t just simply killing a person, but deeply offensive provocation against his incomparably noble position!</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the sixteen kingdom alliance, no one had ever dared naysay him as he ran roughshod through all the sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It’d only ever been him controlling the life and death of others, and others listening to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When had it ever turned into someone else daring to challenge his authority, dictating the life and death of his sect members, and showing indifference to his threats and warnings??</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of this made Sunchaser grow almost frenzied in his rage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Die, dumb animal!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser transformed into a sphere of red light as he flexed his hand, hurling down a hand seal that blazed like the sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pressure only rivaled by an enormous mountain range slammed down on Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen knew that he wouldn’t be able to take this hit that an origin realm cultivator had put his full force behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He curled up his body and had a lotus vine directly drag him beneath the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser howled angrily as his eyes grew crimson with bloodlust. He screamed in rage, “Jiang Chen, you will be hard pressed to escape death even if you fly through the skies and earth today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser flicked his hand as a broadsword appeared in his hand. He gripped it with both hands. It rose up as if a wheel of the blazing sun, dancing with astonishing flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The circular light from the broadsword snapped, transforming into a slab of cutting intent straight into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rumble!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A deep moat immediately appeared in the ground as if a bull had just finished plowing the fields, extending into the ground for a good ten feet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A frosty look glinted in Sunchaser’s eyes as he shot towards Gouyu and the others in the distance, shouting, “Kill all the intruders!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This command was naturally issued to the Purple Sun Sect senior executives following behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Purple Sun Sect had been completely emptied out this time. Sect head Spiritual Master Zixu and many other elders, all those who held actual power in their hands, had all arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sect’s great army had quickly made their way over to encircle Gouyu and the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gouyu was rather calm at the moment. Even though the Purple Sun Sect’s army had arrived, their numbers were far below than the Swordbird army’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Younger sister Huang’er, take advantage of the pitched battle later to slip away. You’re not of the Jiang family, so they won’t strive to keep you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gouyu looked at Huang’er with a trace of apology in her eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er was rather composed as she smiled faintly, “Don’t be in such a rush to leave, elder sister Gouyu. Have some more confidence in your young master!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Numerous vines suddenly exploded out from the ground at this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s figure suddenly bounced off of one of the vines and leapt onto the back of his Goldwing Swordbird. A clear whistle rang through the air, and the Goldwing Swordbirds all started to move and set up their defensive formations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The power of several hundred Goldwing Swordbirds setting up the Eight Trigrams Assimilation Formation under Jiang Chen’s orders was absolutely astonishing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Sunchaser saw Jiang Chen once again reveal himself, his rage boiled over and he growled, “Jiang Chen, your death is nigh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser was like a maddened beast at the moment, striking without abandon and completely oblivious to everything else around him. His figure flashed as he shot into the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chirp!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several hundred Goldwing Swordbirds beat their wings in unison. Layers of golden colored light slowly formed into a ripple that gently undulated towards Sunchaser.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser furiously thrust his palm towards the ripple but was almost instantly repelled, his body shuddering at the backlash. His arm had actually been struck numb!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This attack had stopped his charge cold!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A blow from a third level origin realm had been unable to destroy the opponent’s formation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser was shocked and livid. He lifted his broadsword and swung viciously down, aiming for the heart of the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main army from the Purple Sun Sect had arrived at this point as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spiritual Master Zixu and another group of elders all took their places, ready to join the fray with combined attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was incensed and reached for his storage ring, ready to take out the Millionditch Stonenest and summon the Goldbiter Rat tribe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the moment, patches of aqua clouds swiftly scudded across the sky from the south. A low and weathered voice rolled in. “Sunchaser, do you not care for face anymore? How dare you mobilize the power of an entire sect for one of the junior disciples of my Precious Tree Sect?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice belonged to forefather Thousandleaf of the Precious Tree Sect!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Judging from the looks of things, it would seem that the entire Precious Tree Sect had been emptied out as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser’s face grew cold when he heard this voice, and he looked over to the south. His killing intent immediately doubled. “Everyone, attack with all your strength! Kill Jiang Chen first and then exterminate the Precious Tree Sect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would see things through no matter the consequences.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser was caught in the throes of his fury at the moment. He hated everything and anything associated with Jiang Chen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the most common way in that Sunchaser expressed his hatred was to slaughter everything in sight and wipe out the clan!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had wanted to use the Goldbiter Rats, but abruptly changed his mind when he saw those from the Precious Tree Sect arrive. He laughed heartily and completely activated the Lotus, hovering around the formation and providing ad-hoc cover for the Goldwing Swordbirds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He held throwing daggers crafted from the Raven King’s tail feathers in his hands, God’s Eye shining like a beacon at midnight as he searched for an opening in front of the formation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was prepared to give the senior executives of the Purple Sun Sect a lethal blow at any moment.</span></p>
