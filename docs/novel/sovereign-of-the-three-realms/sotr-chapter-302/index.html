 <p><span style>Chapter 302: Passing Easily</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will challenge the fifth level.” Jiang Chen said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?” The organizer was startled. To start off at the fifth level, wasn’t that too risky?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fifth level is equivalent to the second level spirit realm. You’ll face a golem of the second level spirit realm in it, and you can only deploy the ‘Obscure Seal of Life and Death’. Have you made your decision?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The organizer was rather kind hearted as he said a reminder to Jiang Chen because he felt that this young man’s decision was simply too risky. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ordinarily speaking, those who could pass the fifth level were absolutely able to rank at the top. They had hope of being in the top eighty, not to mention just the top eight thousand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usually, the wisest choice for candidates was either the first or second level secret chambers.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That would be the equivalent of a true qi realm golem. Candidates could get in some practice, familiarize themselves with the technique, and warm up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To challenge the fifth level on his first try, that was an absolute joke! Did this candidate want to shoot himself in the foot?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen flashed a friendly smile to express his gratitude. He did indeed feel the organizer’s kindness through his reminder.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He still nodded resolutely, “Yes, the fifth level. I’ve decided.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing that the candidate himself was this firm, the organizer naturally couldn’t force him to go against his will. He sighed lightly and nodded, “Alright, this is the entrance to the fifth level. You will enter by yourself. Remember, the time of your challenge will become the basis of your ranking.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the organizer didn’t know who Jiang Chen was, he still rather admired such a young man with such daring and courage.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen stepped forward, pushed open the door, walked through it and felt it close slowly behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The organizer looked at the slowly closing door and shook his head lightly, “When had the ordinary disciples become this impulsive? The ordinary disciples in my memory have always been quite cautious, due to lack of resources and knowledge. They’ve always been timid and fearful. This young man is rather odd.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other organizers had walked over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that they were also curious about the candidate who had finished understanding the technique in six hours. They couldn’t help but ask, “What level did that candidate choose?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Guess!” The organizer purposely put on an air of mystery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m guessing that it would be the first level, the lowest level. That fellow most likely wants to make use of the easiest level to determine his battle capabilities.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed! He must want to deepen his understanding through practical combat. If he could fully digest this technique in six hours, then his powers of comprehension would be much too strong!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s also possible that he’s practiced the ‘Obscure Seal of Life and Death’ before?” An organizer proposed. He didn’t believe that anyone would be able to fully comprehend a technique in six hours.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh heh… ” The organizer smiled bizarrely. “He chose the fifth level.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The fifth level? You’re joking!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s impossible! To attempt the fifth level after learning this technique for six hours, unless he wants to die, it’s complete horseshit that he wants to fight a second level spirit realm golem with an unpracticed technique!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The organizer shrugged his shoulders with a wry smile, “Believe what you will. He’s gone into the fifth level chamber at any rate.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Crazy, truly mad. Even if he is the freak with the boulder’s heart that they mentioned before with incredible potential, he’ll still be beside himself with regret if he comes out worse for the wear after attempting such a difficult level!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The young are arrogant, perhaps his earlier successes have inflated his head?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The ordinary practitioners still lack that bit of calmness without the cultivation from the sects.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The organizers all sighed with emotion, patently not thinking much about Jiang Chen’s actions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main organizer also sighed, “I also subtly hinted all this to him, but he was quite resolute and he didn’t seem like someone who could be convinced.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then it’s right that he should suffer for his lack of flexibility.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh huh, if he really is that freak with the boulder’s heart, then the four sects will still fight over him, even if he fails the trial.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>That was also the truth. Although this was a trial and the rules were the rules, Jiang Chen’s previous performance as a genius of the heart, superior spirit potential, and being the last to be bounced out of the magnetic golden mountain destined him to be a hot commodity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The doors to the chamber opened again as the organizers were chatting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen walked out with a leisurely expression. It looked like the edges of his clothes hadn’t even been ruffled, that he’d gone in only for a cup of tea.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What?!” The organizers all goggled. “What are you doing out here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can I not leave after the exam is over?” Jiang Chen was taken aback.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Over?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was indeed over. When the organizers confirmed this point, their expressions became quite a sight to see. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They had thought very little of him, but this candidate had taken care of the golem of the fifth level with a shake of his body. This candidate had settled things so quickly that it was like it had been as simple as killing a fly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Had cheating occurred?</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were countless eyes surveilling the secret chambers. A candidate would be immediately disqualified if they used any other martial arts technique. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This was to say that this candidate had truly used the ‘Obscure Seal of Life and Death’ to pass the exam and crush the gatekeeper of this level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s results were recorded in his token.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The organizer’s tone was noticeably more polite when he returned the token to Jiang Chen. “Young man, will you continue your challenge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled faintly. “I’ve gained some knowledge in this battle. I need to digest these new findings and I will return in an hour.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>In an hour!?</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the other organizers were stunned. There were a full ten days allotted for this trial.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no need for the candidates to be in such a hurry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The main organizer sighed as he watched Jiang Chen walked out. “We’ve truly grown old. When did such a perverse genius appear in the mundane world?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, interesting, how very interesting! I really want to know who this fellow is behind the mask!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m guessing that it’s one of the outer disciples of the four sects, stooping in order to conquer, biding his time in order to emerge from the masses in the great selection.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that the organizers thought too little of the mundane disciples, but that their first thought was still that, it made more sense for such a genius to appear in the outer arms of the four sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even though it was the outer arms, they were still somewhat linked to the sects even if they couldn’t enjoy the core resources of the sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was possible that a couple geniuses would appear in the outer arms of the sects every now and then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen appeared as he said he would, an hour later.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He once again jumped levels and wanted to challenge the seventh level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The fifth level was the equivalent of second level spirit realm, but the seventh was at the peak of third level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was one step away from the earth spirit realm, and the difficulty of the seventh level was much greater than the fifth level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some of the organizers looked at Jiang Chen with an odd look when they saw that he’d risen to the seventh level in one go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They didn’t dare suspect this crazy genius now, but they also wanted to see how far this genius could go.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the door to the seventh level secret chamber closed slowly, the main organizer sighed once again. “We had thought that he was the crazy one, arrogant beyond belief and having the vision of a frog in a well from the ordinary world. It turns out that we were the ones with the limited outlook instead.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words made some of the organizers unsure of whether to laugh or cry.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they didn’t care for these words, they made sense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golem of the peak of the third level was indeed much stronger than before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen realized that this golem wouldn’t be a pushover as soon as he came face to face with it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he too was at the peak of the third level spirit realm as well. Add to that his various advantages, he would still be able to flit through this level with ease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, Jiang Chen didn’t pursue a quick fight this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the contrary, he was actually sparring with the golem, making use of it to train himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he’d sought speed in the first challenge, then he was aiming for slowness in the second challenge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would be able to comprehend the essence of the technique through a slow battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was going to make use of this opponent with the same level of strength as him to harden himself, continuously perfecting the ‘Obscure Seal of Life and Death’ and pursue the legendary realm of mastery.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was well aware that he could challenge at most the eighth level of difficulty if he reached the level of perfection.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the difficulty of the eighth level was enough for him to be on top, Jiang Chen’s goal was the challenge the highest level of difficulty. He would challenge the peak since he had entered the trial. Such was the true essence of martial dao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The golem in the highest difficulty level was the equivalent of an earth spirit realm practitioner at fifth level spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the golems wouldn’t be as capricious nor as wily as humans. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the level of their strength was there. Jiang Chen wanted to make use of practical combat to increase his understanding of the ‘Obscure Seal of Life and Death’. Using practical combat to increase his own combat skills was his strategy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He would have hope of battling the tenth level chamber golem only if he comprehended the legendary realm of this technique and deployed it beyond the level of great perfection.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen flung out a hand seal that was the same as the one that the golem was forming. His body danced like falling leaves as his left hand cast out another seal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wham wham wham!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The blows rang out continuously as air currents suddenly exploded in the chamber, forcing high pitched sounds from the air, witnessing the ferocity of the fight.</span></p>
