<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 442: The Origin of the Ninesuns Sky Sect</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er was forthright and didn’t attempt to deny her involvement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a gentleman, Jiang Chen didn’t continue his line of questioning once Huang’er had admitted her part in things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er actually looked at Jiang Chen with a slight smile. “Sir Jiang, Elder Shun once said that he estimated that you would enter the origin realm in three years. I scoffed at the idea then. Today, two of those three years have passed, and here you stand, already at spirit king, but half a step away from origin realm.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was also surprised. Elder Shun had thought so highly of him that he’d thought Jiang Chen would break through to the origin realm in three years?</span></p>
 <p><span style>One had to understand that there were many factors as to why Jiang Chen had had such a smooth journey so far. However, many of these factors had been ones that Elder Shun would’ve been unable to anticipate beforehand. Even so, the elder had made that prediction three years ago, a testament to his foresight and breadth of vision.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was rather curious at this moment, just what was the cultivation level of this grandfather and granddaughter duo?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he’d known and seen many things in his past life, it was difficult to ascertain someone else’s cultivation level unless they purposefully displayed their strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Elder Shun and Huang’er kept such a low profile that Jiang Chen had no way of estimating their strength.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only one thing was absolutely certain, that Huang’er’s cultivation level was far above the earth origin realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen wasn’t dejected or envious. His strength would rise one step at a time as long as he held true to his path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Jiang, the Sky Sect will absolutely not rest easy after coming off worse in the exchange that day. The Precious Tree Sect’s foundations will find it difficult to withstand their blows. What plans do you have?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen started slightly, not having anticipated Miss Huang’er’s words. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know how strong the Sky Sect is, but since I’ve joined the Precious Tree Sect, I cannot leave as I would. The world of martial dao constantly turns, and there exists no one who can take advantage of both sides. At the end of the day, it’s best to have some principles. Although I’ve just entered the Precious Tree Sect, I seemed to have built a marvelous connection with the Precious Tree after a month’s meditation beneath its branches. I have a feeling that although the Precious Tree Sect lacks sufficient foundation and is weak, it’s a sect that will pass down a legacy of spirit.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s words weren’t putting himself up on a pedestal. Although it hadn’t been long since he’d joined the Precious Tree Sect, he’d found a sense of home after sitting beneath the Precious Tree for a month.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, when Miss Huang’er had asked him what his plans were, he didn’t speak lofty words of dignity with self righteous zeal. His heart was filled with the resolution to never submit to the Sky Sect. Even though he wouldn’t quite go to the lengths of dying together with it, he would absolutely fight to the last minute.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t because he had great feelings for the Precious Tree Sect, but because he had a deep emotional connection to the Precious Tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er’s question had also been a probing one. When she heard Jiang Chen’s response, she too nodded lightly and was privately impressed by how accurate Elder Shun’s assessment of Jiang Chen had been.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sir Jiang was truly one who valued relationships, a genuinely dependable person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er had come to experience human nature in abundance since childhood. Most had sought to conspire against each other and nurse their schemes close to the heart. Someone as open and forthright, as perfectly straightforward in his actions like Jiang Chen, and also direct and decisive about his debts of gratitude and grudges, were few and far in between.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er suddenly felt that taking up residence in the sixteen kingdoms was actually not a bad thing. At least, the people she’d come in contact with during this time had all been very friendly and quite openminded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taking those next to Jiang Chen for example, they were all very friendly and polite. They didn’t ostracize her for her looks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely because of this that Huang’er felt a bit ashamed of herself. She felt that concealing her features and purposefully appearing thus rather showed her as being not as transparent as the others.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, since things had developed thus, she couldn’t revert to her original looks any longer. She could only continue down this path.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t want the others to misunderstand her because of her looks and exile her instead, causing her to lose the friendships she’d made.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er was similar in age to Jiang Chen. The years in which she’d traveled around outside with Elder Shun were the most she’d seen of the ramshackle life of a wanderer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, they’d also been the happiest and most simple time of her life as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no need for plotting or politics, no need for anything complex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She truly treasured this time, and had even wished that these days could continue, with no changes ever appearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sadly, the wind continues to blow even when the trees wish to stay still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sky Sect envoy had broken the peace she’d found during this time. She hadn’t wanted to become embroiled in this conflict.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, the envoy had been unforgivingly tyrannical. Had they swallowed the Precious Tree Sect, it would’ve impacted her life here as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She, and those she’d recently befriended, would see changes develop in their quiet lives.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was something Huang’er never wanted to see happen, which was why she couldn’t help but make a move to protect this simple and joyful lifestyle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, she truly viewed Jiang Chen as a friend after the times they’d spent together.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er was a considerate person, she didn’t want Jiang Chen to know that she’d helped. Although she knew that he wasn’t the sort to care unduly about face, some criticism would develop if the others knew that he’d relied on the help of a woman in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She didn’t even want him to know it was her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jiang Chen was such a smart person that he’d been able to guess it was her from the sound of the music. Since he had asked, she naturally wouldn’t deny her involvement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a good thing that Jiang Chen was an openminded person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, she couldn’t help but remind him, “The Precious Tree Sect is truly lucky to have Sir Jiang. However, the Sky Sect has quite a background to them and thus a strategy needs to be in place for their arrival.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen knew nothing about the Sky Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he’d seen much in his past life, it was impossible to know everything on every plane like the back of his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention that he wasn’t certain at all if the continent on this plane of existence was a part of the myriad worlds he had known in his past life. After all, the universe was vast, and the various worlds just a small corner of the cosmos.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jiang Chen felt that this world should have something to do with the myriad worlds in his past life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were simply too many things here that he’d seen and understood before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he didn’t know anything about the structure of this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A thought struck him. Miss Huang’er was so mysterious and so powerful, she must be from a powerful place. Why not take advantage of the opportunity to ask her?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss Huang’er, do you know of the Sky Sect’s background?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm, the Sky Sect, full name Ninesuns Sky Sect, comes from the Upper Eighth Region and is one of the eight great powers of that realm. They would count as a premier force in this world.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A premier force even in this world, that was an impressive background indeed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er smiled faintly as her slender fingers probed slightly, taking out an ancient book and placing it on the stone pedestal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Jiang, this ancient book is named ‘The Annals of Mountains and Rivers’. It records the structure of our world and chronicles all the territories, powers, and cultures within. Although simple, it’s a book that acts as a map. This book has helped Elder Shun and I greatly in our travels these years. If Sir Jiang is interested, you can peruse this book.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen accepted the book with the words “The Annals of Mountains and Rivers” written on the cover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he flipped open to the first page, the words “The Annals of the Divine Abyss Continent” appeared.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a book would never appear in a place like the sixteen kingdom alliance. In this small backwater, ninety nine percent of its people would never even have left their birthplace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the extreme experts had only been to the Myriad Domain or other territories within. They’d never walked out of the area.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, a precious tome that encompassed the entire world would never appear here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen caressed the book, sensing the passage of time contained within. He was more sure than ever that Miss Huang’er and Elder Shun had an impressive background.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ordinary characters would never have such a literary work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen didn’t shy away as he began to leaf through it seriously.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This continent was named the “Divine Abyss Continent”. The main part of the continent was divided into the Upper Eight, Mid Sixteen, and Lower Thirty Two Regions. The rest of the continent was made up of countless areas of desolate wilderness, the sea, and mysterious locations that wouldn’t be seen in maps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when Jiang Chen saw the words “Divine Abyss Continent”, his heart spasmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t help that reaction when some memories from his past life floated upwards in his heart. The face of his first father, the Celestial Emperor, flashed in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he recalled his father’s careful and attentive care, the efforts he’d put into refining the Sun Moon Pill, how his father’s fate was still unknown after the heavens had shattered…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen truly found it hard to control himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>The words of “Divine Abyss Continent” <a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> really tugged on his heartstrings, since his father’s title had been Emperor Taiyuan—the emperor of the deepest abyss.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>That single word “yuan” summoned endless memories from Jiang Chen’s past life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The powers in the Divine Abyss were divided into upper, mid, and lower ranks, from rank nine to one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ninesuns Sky Sect was naturally a first rank sect. All first rank sects would have the word “sky” in their names, illustrating their pinnacle level of existence with direct access to the authorities.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the four great sects in the sixteen kingdoms, they were likely seventh rank powers. In the greater scheme of things, that would place them firmly in the lower rank.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen couldn’t help but sigh when he read up to here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That a first rank sect was looking upon a seventh rank Precious Tree, Myriad Spirit, and Flowing Wind Sect with favor also meant that the former was assured of victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen could understand in that moment why Zuo Lan had been so arrogant and domineering.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even a rank four inspector from a first rank sect had the right to call the shots and do as he wished in the sixteen kingdoms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ordinarily speaking, who would be able to prevent the light of a first rank sect from shining on a small place like the sixteen kingdom alliance? Even a sneeze from a first rank sect would be enough to destroy a seventh rank sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen closed the book lightly and smiled ruefully. “The Ninesuns Sky Sect is a big house with great undertakings. I don’t know if their appetite is too big in wanting a poor place like the sixteen kingdom alliance, or if a door had slammed on their brains. No matter how one looks at it, it really is disgraceful for a first rank sect to bully seventh ranks.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er smiled. “The competition between the eight powers in the Upper Eight Regions is wild and venomous. They itch to extend their influence to every corner of the Divine Abyss Continent. Using the Ninesuns Sky Sect as an example, they seek to make the sixteen kingdom alliance one of their divisions. I estimate that they have at least three thousand of these divisions scattered throughout the continent.”</span></p>
