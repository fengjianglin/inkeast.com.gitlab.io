</div>
<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 455: A Fight Between Earth Sage Realm Experts, Golden Lotuses Surge</span></p>
 <p><span style>The heavyweights of the Myriad Domain sects continuously sent hidden messages to their sect geniuses, explaining some of the key points of this battle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The first rate sects had all brought their premier geniuses this time. Although they were quite a ways away from the sage realm, they had witnessed many things, including matches between sage realm experts thanks to being born in the great sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They naturally comprehended much thanks to the analysis of their sects’ powerhouses. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the young geniuses of second and third rate powers, their potential was a bit worse to begin with, as were their comprehension abilities. Add to that the strength of their sects’ experts being far weaker than that of the first rate sects, it was obvious that their explanations were much more crude.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only Jiang Chen had no need for a running commentary.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi didn’t seem inclined to pay him any attention either. Rather, he leisurely watched the match with a faint smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi had quite a stratagem up his sleeve at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whether Xuan Zhen won or lost, neither outcome would affect his dao heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In fact, Dan Chi rather wished that Xuan Zhen wouldn’t win, so that he would have the opportunity to fight Feng Beidou.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi deeply yearned for this battle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He craved the challenge of facing off with a tenth rank inspector from the Sky Sect. This fight would be the one that spread his name throughout the Myriad Domain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Dan Chi glanced aside, in Jiang Chen’s direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He noticed Jiang Chen was watching with great interest, without missing the slightest detail from the ring. Furthermore, contemplation and theorization shone in his eyes as the fight progressed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mm?” Dan Chi found this interesting. “Jiang Chen seems to be scrutinizing a match between the sage realm. Could it be that he sees through it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi found this incredible. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked again at the origin realm cultivators around him. Although they were all watching intently, the look swirling in their eyes indicated that they only understood parts of this match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Dan Chi saw traces of something else in Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Astounding, simply astounding. If it wasn’t for tangible evidence, I would never believe that this genius is only twenty years old. Just what kind of feng shui does the Eastern Kingdom boast to have cultivated this kind of genius?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi was quite curious about Jiang Chen at this moment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The mysterious elder repeatedly reminded me me to pay attention to Jiang Chen. It seems like he must be a genius who the mysterious elder has personally raised and is fated to rise in the Myriad Domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi recalled Elder Shun and although the latter had never told Dan Chi his name, the mysterious senior had long-since possessed the status of a deity in Dan Chi’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seven days worth of pointers from Elder Shun had been equivalent to more than ten years worth of effort and accumulation of knowledge from Dan Chi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Pointers at his stage of cultivation were something that no legacy or pills were able to help him with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was just like how one saw vastly different scenery and worldview from a thousand meters compared to form ten thousand meters.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Increasing his martial dao cultivation was one thing, but most importantly was that Elder Shun’s pointers had improved his knowledge of martial dao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi couldn’t help but speculate when he looked at Jiang Chen, “Jiang Chen must have an inexplicable relationship with the mysterious senior. The senior must be a reclusive expert from the Upper Eight Regions. He might even be an ‘emperor realm’ cultivator!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The emperor realm followed after the sage realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those at the peak of the emperor realm were hailed as a Great Emperor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Great Emperors were the pinnacle of existence in the entire Divine Abyss Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those characters almost never ventured out. If they did, a mere stomp of their foot was enough to shake the entire Continent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From Dan Chi’s understanding of the Continent, the Upper Eight Regions were the highest existence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even he had only vague knowledge of the even more mysterious places beyond it. He heard of them occasionally, but didn’t know what was true or false.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Even if that mysterious senior isn’t a Great Emperor, he is surely at the peak of the emperor realm. That I, Dan Chi, could receive seven days worth of pointers from him is three lives worth of good fortune. If Jiang Chen is the personal disciple of that senior, then his future is limitless! However, I wonder why the senior has left him in the Myriad Domain. There must be a covert reason behind this. Since the senior wishes to act through my Regal Pill Palace, then I cannot shirk from this responsibility. Not only is this my chance, it is an opportunity for the Regal Pill Palace!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi had long-since revered Elder Shun as a deity, and was treating Elder Shun’s words as infallible law.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a thought struck Dan Chi as he subtly shifted to Jiang Chen. He smiled faintly, “Young friend Jiang Chen, I am Dan Chi, the Palace Head of the Regal Pill Palace.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A light winked through Jiang Chen’s eyes when he saw Dan Chi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen greets Sage Dan Chi.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Haha, no need to stand on ceremony. Everyone has been belittling, slandering and suspecting me. Or even thinking that I’ve gone mad for allying with the Precious Tree Sect. But from now on, they will envy, admire, or even hate that I’ve picked up a treasure.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled faintly. “Sage Dan Chi is no ordinary person and thus does no ordinary actions.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No ordinary person and thus does no ordinary actions.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This proclaimation greatly pleased Dan Chi and he became wreathed in smiles. He looked upon Jiang Chen with a great deal more favor after these words, and he vaguely felt that someone who understood him stood in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi had always had a unique style of doing things. He never followed protocol and often strayed from the established way.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His methods were completely embodied by Jiang Chen’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, he was no ordinary person, so his actions were often unexpected and therefore extraordinary in the eyes of outsiders.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, good!” Dan Chi lauded. “Jiang Chen, I have only one thing to say, and that’s that the doors of the Regal Pill Palace are always open to you. Of the talents in the younger generation that I know, if you ranked second, no one would dare rank first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was an exceedingly high compliment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen didn’t attempt to humbly decline the compliment as he smiled openly and then looked to the ring again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, what do you think of this match?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Every move and technique of those in the sage realm are profound and trigger reactions in heaven and earth. Vice Head Xuan Zhen does not have a high chance of winning this match.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen spoke candidly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi also laughed heartily. “My compliments! Few origin realm cultivators could have the same foresight as you. Jiang Chen, even if I were to place you in the rankings of the Myriad Domain geniuses right now, you would absolutely make it into the top thirty.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Top thirty?” Jiang Chen chuckled. ‘It looks like there is much motivation for me to train well.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Top thirty?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This wasn’t the ranking that Jiang Chen wanted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even top ten or five wasn’t the ranking that Jiang Chen wanted, much less top thirty.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he desired was always that highest position. If he didn’t climb to the peak of the Divine Abyss Continent, then to him that meant he hadn’t succeeded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The son of the Celestial Emperor, a million years in his past life. If he couldn’t reach the top of a continent in a single plane of existence with these advantages, then he would’ve truly and thoroughly failed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The situation in the ring changed as they spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A loud explosion rang out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan Zhen and Hua Qianli had slammed their palms together more than a dozen times as their figures flashed to and fro. Xuan Zhen took a few steps backwards, with Hua Qianli retreating a dozen steps as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xuan Zhen clutched his chest with an ashen face and sighed bitterly, “Palace Head, your subordinate is incompetent.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Hua Qianli had won, it had been a hard-fought victory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master Feng, your subordinate was lucky enough to not fail his mission.” Hua Qianli raised his hands in a cupped-fist salute, when suddenly both combatants simultaneously opened their mouths and spat out a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Hua Qianli had achieved a hard-fought victory, he’d paid the price with a mouthful of blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Beidou nodded slightly, but he actually felt extremely awkward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He even wished that Hua Qianli had lost in that moment. That way, he wouldn’t have to take the field.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even when he returned to the Sky Sect, he could’ve pointed Hua Qianli and Sunchaser as the ones responsible.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But now with Hua Qianli’s victory, he had to take the field as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unfortunately, Dan Chi completely dictated the mood of their match. Feng Beidou had been adjusting his mentality during the previous fight, but the crack that had appeared in his heart had yet to mend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that as long as this crack didn’t heal, he would have a slim chance of winning in a fight against Dan Chi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi, on the other hand, obviously planned on not giving Fei Beidou a single chance. He barked out in laughter, “Envoy Feng, it looks like our match is unavoidable. Whether it’s your Sky Sect securing a position in the sixteen kingdoms alliance, or my Regal Pill Palace successfully allying with the Precious Tree Sect, the winner of our match will determine the outcome!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi had a grand presence to him as he circulated his qi while he spoke, golden light flaring out behind him and soaring to the clouds. Sage realm qi currents continuously flowed out of him to form golden lotuses as he took each step.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Golden lotuses surging out of the earth!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s golden lotuses! He’s an earth sage realm expert alright!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three flowers over one’s head was the sign of the mortal sage realm, whereas golden lotuses was the hallmark symbol of an earth sage realm cultivator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the golden currents lifted Dan Chi’s body upwards as he shot into the sky in a beam of light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Feng Beidou, although we’re not of the sky sage realm, our cultivation has reached the high enough to fight in the air. The Precious Tree Sect territory is small and likely will not hold up beneath our movements. Why don’t we fight in the air for our match. Are you brave enough to take the challenge?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sage realm cultivators could fly through the air through their own arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they reached sky sage realm, it was as if they’d grown wings and possessed full freedom of movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Feng Beidou and Dan Chi were of the earth sage realm, they too had certain capability to fly through the air. Although they wouldn’t be as carefree as those in the sky sage realm, they could still fly smoothly via certain arts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone was taken aback by Dan Chi’s proposal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that no one fought in the skies, but that this was usually done through steeds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Actual aerial combat between cultivators alone was quite rare.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was an impossible sight in the sixteen kingdoms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Blood thrummed through Jiang Chen’s veins and adrenaline surged as he watched Dan Chi rise into the air in a column of golden colored light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sage realm cultivators can fly through the air. It looks like I still have a long path to walk until I reach that step!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen sighed, full of anticipation for the sage realm.</span></p>
