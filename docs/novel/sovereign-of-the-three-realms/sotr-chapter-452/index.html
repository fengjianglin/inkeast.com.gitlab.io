 <p><span style>Chapter 452: Battling Sunchaser</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the heavyweights on par with Dan Chi in the Myriad Domain were a bit moved when they saw the sudden aura rising from Jiang Chen, not to mention the young geniuses.</span></p>
 <p><span style>"Is he that Jiang Chen? Such a genius actually exists amongst the younger generation of the sixteen kingdoms?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tsk tsk, incredible! This kid looks no more than twenty-something, not only has he broken through to the origin realm, but his strength is so strong as well! It looks like the sixteen kingdoms have indeed been underestimated.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Could it be that the legends speak truly of this kid killing the one with innate constitution and suppressing the Sky Sect?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Dan Chi has always been one to act alone. It looks like the target of his enormous gamble this time may very well be this Jiang Chen!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The powerhouses of the Myriad Domain were all inwardly stunned. They’d been all perplexed at first and felt that Dan Chi was playing with fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for gossip in the outside world saying that he was doing so for Jiang Chen, everyone had been contemptuous of this saying and felt that he was just using it as an excuse.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However—</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s entrance had changed everyone’s thoughts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made the powerhouses of the Myriad Domain all thoroughly understand—the greatest reason why Dan Chi had done so was indeed likely because of Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen… you!” Sunchaser was similarly dumbfounded at this time, mouth agape and unable to form a sentence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He almost thought that he was hallucinating just then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The overweeningly dominant Sunchaser had actually become ashen-faced from Jiang Chen’s aura a moment ago, unable to speak at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d requested to fight just now because he was certain the Precious Tree Sect was food in his mouth. He’d had an absolute psychological advantage over the Precious Tree Sect all this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt that he could thoroughly trample anyone who took the field.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In his heart, he’d never considered that Jiang Chen would be his opponent. As strong as the latter was, he was only of the spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was only less than a year since the trials of the Eternal Spirit Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had only just entered the sky spirit realm then.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As strong as Jiang Chen was, it should’ve been impossible for him to break through to the origin realm in less than a year.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, Sunchaser hadn’t put him in the list of candidates at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, his sudden appearance and assertive movements had completely thrown his plans in disarray, shattering his beautiful dreams.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only would Jiang Chen be his opponent, he was now also an origin realm cultivator.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was one thing to just break through to the origin realm, but the aura that he was displaying at the mere first level origin realm was actually stronger than Sunchaser’s at peak third level!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser couldn’t accept this at all at first blush.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Zuo Lan saw the situation, he too was steely-faced. Despite him originally gloating, his &nbsp;feelings immediately sank rock bottom. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It had been he who had suggested Sunchaser fight a match, thinking that a victory was in the big. However, things had taken an unexpected turn with Jiang Chen’s appearance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Beidou hectored upon seeing Sunchaser lose his composure, “Sunchaser, is a young man who had just set foot into the origin realm enough to scare you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser grew somber when he heard this and immediately reacted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was an old monster who’d come into his fame over a hundred years ago alright. He knew that he had no path for retreat after Feng Beidou’s words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t just a struggle for superiority between Jiang Chen and himself now, but one between the Sky Sect and the Regal Pill Palace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The outcome of this match would determine his survival and the fortunes of the entire Purple Sun Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If he lost, not only was he done for, but his entire sect as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Sky Sect would never allow one defeated to control the Purple Light Division.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Countless thoughts spun through his head as Sunchaser slowly calmed down. He was someone about to enter the earth origin realm soon! As genius as Jiang Chen was, how strong could he possibly be?</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden flare of his aura just now had indeed been strong, but that was very likely just posturing. With his scant twenty years of age, how could Jiang Chen measure to someone renowned for the past hundred years such as Sunchaser?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser felt that he would never lose when it came to foundations, battle experience, and assortment of harrowing trump cards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Beidou suddenly waved his hand and sent an item shooting towards Sunchaser. He sent a message with his consciousness, “Sunchaser, only victory is allowed and not defeat. I bestow upon you this spirit pearl of fire and ice for protection. All attacks of fire and ice in the origin realm will be nullified against you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser was overjoyed and quickly accepted this item.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hatred of Jiang Chen was as deep as the seas, and he’d naturally done a fair bit of research on Jiang Chen. He knew that Jiang Chen’s Bewitching Lotus of Fire and Ice was exceedingly difficult to defend against.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since the spirit pearl of fire and ice could nullify all attacks of fire and ice, didn’t that mean the Lotus that could move like a ghost was completely ineffective against Sunchaser?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser’s desire to fight instantly grew several times. If that eerie Lotus couldn’t do anything to him, then Jiang Chen alone was prey caught in his hands already.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi couldn’t help but snort derisively when he saw this. “Envoy Feng, this kind of cheating isn’t fair play now, is it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Feng Beidou said faintly, “I didn’t send anyone to help, nor did I break the rules. How am I cheating? Bring out anything good that you have and let Jiang Chen use it. I’ll wait to marvel what you might have.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Regal Pill Palace naturally had their own foundations and treasures, but were truly nothing much compared to a first-ranked sect like the Sky Sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi was about to speak when Jiang Chen waved his hand. “Palace Head Dan Chi, what need is there to borrow anything in order to behead a mere old dog?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi laughed heartily when he heard this. “Good! That’s how a young hero should be! You should let your light shine when need be. Jiang Chen, I’ll wait to drink and chat to your success in beheading Sunchaser’s dog of a head!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser’s face was livid as he roared, “Jiang Chen, youthful pride isn’t your fault, but to be so arrogant as to respect no one, is! I will settle our old and new grudges today! I swear I am less than human if I don’t rip you apart into thousands of pieces!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser made a grasping motion with his hands after speaking, producing a broadsword in his hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, you scum, die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The spirit pearl of fire and ice wasn’t just for defense, it would enhance attacks as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser possessed a fire spirit constitution and had spent half his life tempering his fire cultivation. Prior to Jiang Chen’s appearance, his cultivation in the fire elemental energy had been the first amongst the sixteen kingdoms.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dire cracks appeared in the air as Sunchaser swung the broadsword. Boundless fire elemental energy blazed forth, forming a wall of fire.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A fire dragon churned and created a sea of flames.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sea of flames looked simple, but possessed the unique aura of the origin realm. It was as if the elemental energy had formed a cage that sealed off the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once Jiang Chen was encircled by this sea, his only fate was to be refined to bits and pieces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this kind of attack was simply too crude to Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened his hands and vines from sixteen ice lotuses, astonishing in thickness and size, instantly formed and gave rise to all sorts of ice barriers. They created an ice wall as solid as a mountain in the blink of an eye.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The &nbsp;flame waves instantly halted when they crashed into the ice wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two enormous powers dissipated with a loud hiss, just like the powers of fire and water ramming into each other.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen made hand seals and transformed the waves from the melted ice wall into the force of the Vast Ocean Current Splitter, taking the opportunity to counter-attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The pace of the battle had moved swiftly and the shift in his technique was so exquisite that it was like the moving clouds and flowing waters, accomplished smoothly in a single breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi’s face was wreathed in smiles when he saw how adeptly and easily Jiang Chen utilized his techniques.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen hasn’t disappointed me alright. To speak nothing of his body condition, the usage of these techniques alone is enough to hail him as a super genius. Good, good, good! It looks like I’ve made the right bet this time again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi was a very charismatic and ambitious person. Ever since he’d taken control of the Regal Pill Palace, he’d desired to spread his wings and bring the Regal Pill Palace to the peak of its glory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He himself was a martial dao genius just as well. To be able to hold his own with the other old monster heavyweights of the Myriad Domain was a testament to his potential and talent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was precisely because Dan Chi was younger and possessed such charisma that he was an extraordinary sect head in the Myriad Domain. He had lofty ambition and noble aspirations, a decisive and authoritative style that enabled him to do as he pleased. He was never the sort to dither or hem and haw.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just like how he’d proceeded allying with the Precious Tree Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Chi had set his eyes on Jiang Chen and proceeded forward no matter the criticism and objections from the outside world, never holding any regret.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d now received the return for his actions in the form of Jiang Chen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaster snorted softly, not panicking when he saw the force from this stroke roll forth. He swept across with his broadsword and deflected the oncoming attack.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, turbulent emotions arose in Sunchaser’s heart from this short exchange.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With his cultivation near the earth origin realm and the aid from the spirit pearl of fire and ice, he actually hadn’t gained the upper hand at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s rate of improvement had truly astounded him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If I can’t kill this troublemaker today, I may actually be the one to be trounced and killed by him next time! I must kill him no matter the cost today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A murderous light shone in his eyes as killing intent exploded ten times over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard, it’s either you or me today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser reached with his hand as he spoke, a string of red prayer beads appearing within.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As soon as he flung the prayer beads into the air, they actually grew bigger! Each bead actually transformed into a sinister and horrifying skull.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser cackled, “Jiang Chen, you have the chance to taste what it feels like to be burned by heavenly fires today!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pointed with his broadsword as the prayer beads started rotating rapidly. The twenty four skulls hummed as they closed in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The skulls were blazing bright, as if each of them nurtured a volcano inside that would erupt with wanton abandon at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heavenly fire, descend!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The twenty four skulls seemed to be alive in that moment as their orifices lit up, shooting forth with blue flame that rumbled downwards. </span></p>
 <p><span style>With their open orifices, the twenty four skulls seemed like an endless stream of heavenly fire, shooting downwards like meteors. It was as if a pill cauldron had been overturned and countless heavenly meteors had descended into the mortal realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And the flames were all blue!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When flames turned blue, this entailed that the fire wasn’t ordinary, but one with extraordinary origin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although it was an exaggeration to call it heavenly fire, it was definitely not on the same level as ordinary fire elemental energy!</span></p>
