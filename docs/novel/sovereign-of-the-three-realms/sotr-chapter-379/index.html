 <p><span style>Chapter 379: I’ll Slap Whoever Dares Show Their Face</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen stayed in his residence for the next three days, not setting a single foot outside. He turned a deaf ear to all the occurrences and furor of the outside world, and declined all guests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After breaking through to the fifth level, his martial dao inspiration geysered forth, forcing him to spend a great deal of time to digest the explosive changes after this breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The God’s Eye and Ear of the Zephyr broke through continuously, stopping only at the 15th level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boulder’s Heart became even more stable at the 12th level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Under his undying efforts, Psychic’s Head also entered the seventh level.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His increase in level also continued to bring inspiration for the boxing techniques of the “Divine Aeons Fist”. There were vague signs of him entering the great perfection realm of the nine cycles of blooming and wilting.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eight styles as well as interpretations of the “Vast Ocean Current Splitter” also bubbled forth as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The explosive flood of inspiration made him incredibly excited. If he wasn’t in the secret chamber, he probably would’ve started practicing right then and there.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, even simulating techniques in one’s mind was a type of consolidation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen immersed himself in the world of martial dao and unleashed his inspiration to the utmost, digesting what his breakthrough had brought him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was the subject of intense discussion in the outside world as his closed door session lasted for three days. All sorts of rumors and gossip kept surfacing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you see that? The so-called secular genius is so weak and fragile. A little setback is enough to do him in and make him give up on himself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks like he truly was just a shooting star, burning out in a fleeting second. Is this kind of psychological strength worthy of being called a genius? What a joke!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Has this fellow killed himself because he couldn’t take the blow? Hahaha, it’s not easy for a mundane ant to make it to this step. Do you think we’ve been too cruel?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Cruel? Please. Having poor strength of heart makes him utterly unfit for the world of martial dao. If he wants to make it in this world, he must be able to accept this harsh reality.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He probably hasn’t committed suicide, but he’ll be finished for good after this. Forget it, it’s not worth talking about an ant with subpar strength of heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those so-called geniuses were all making critical remarks and putting on an air of noble aloofness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Pathetic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Xinghan could only shake his head internally when he heard those words. These so-called geniuses were putting on too crude of an sham. With this kind of personality, they were destined to become cannon fodder for others on the path of martial dao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chu Xinghan didn’t believe that with Jiang Chen’s personality, he’d be knocked down permanently by this. </span><i><span style>He’d even wanted to take the risk of being killed in order to kill Long Juxue that day at the Second Crossing.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A man with that kind of determination wouldn’t be defeated so easily. This little setback was likely nothing in his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not emerging for three days, can it be that he’s converted fury to motivation and has decided to immerse himself in cultivation?” A thought flashed through Chu Xinghan’s mind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It made sense to him. Jiang Chen had farmed almost two thousand points by now. He was solidly in the 50th percentile with his score and didn’t need to worry about demotion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps he was making use of this opportunity to quietly immerse himself in training and reappear with renewed vigor after his humiliation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong arrived outside Jiang Chen’s yard at least ten times over the three days of seclusion. He paced back and forth outside the doors each time but didn't go in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d always swing by after he finished his day’s missions.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he wasn’t afraid that Jiang Chen would want to take his life, he still felt a bit unstable that his boss hadn’t showed his face for a few days.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“These despicable petty characters all talk about someone behind their backs. Hmph, how is it possible that someone I’ve taken for a boss is defeated so easily?” Tang Hong was wholly dismissive of the gossip circulating around the outside world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t think that his boss was the sort to give up on all hope after being knocked down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His boss’ strength of heart was enough to even solidly triumph over Tang Hong, how could he possibly be defeated by this minor matter?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“When boss told me to leave that day, he said he wanted to train. Can it be that he’s broken through in his cultivation?” Tang Hong stood outside Jiang Chen’s yard and paced back and forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He wrung his large hands and appeared a bit agitated. He would occasionally tug at his straw-like hair and completely mess it up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite his appearance, all the geniuses passing by avoided such a fierce fellow standing outside of Jiang Chen’s residence, deathly afraid of provoking this harbinger of trouble.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone knew that Tang Hong was someone not to be provoked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who’d talked about Jiang Chen behind his back was even more scared to bump into Tang Hong. They might very well be hauled in for a beating.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d never been the sort to just stick to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one would be able to withstand him if he went off into one of his moods. Who would dare irritate him, especially during circumstances like these?</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, those folks also muttered inwardly, </span><i><span style>Tang Hong isn’t right in the head, is he? He doesn’t latch onto the leg of the Iron family, but has taken some nobody from the mundane world as his boss instead.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This was as if a prince in the ordinary world refused to build friendships with noble sons and ran to call ordinary citizens his brothers instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To many, these actions were so idiotic, it was like his brain had been thoroughly smashed by a door.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Except, while these self-styled smart folk may indeed be stronger than Tang Hong in using small tricks and schemes, how many of them possessed his wisdom?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong may have a direct personality, but that didn’t mean he didn’t know how to read people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d formed a friendship with Jiang Chen after fighting him that day. Otherwise, why would he be willing to take Jiang Chen as his boss? It obviously wasn’t just because of the bet.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was because Jiang Chen had easily trampled him in the areas of strength of heart and pills.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d even probed him twice in the area of martial dao before entering the Divine Maze Tower and had still failed to gain the upper hand. </span></p>
 <p><span style>This also meant that the secular genius’ potential in martial dao was absolutely not inferior to his, and his strength of heart and the dao of pills was far beyond his own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And this kind of person had come from the mundane world!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A candidate from the ordinary world had easily defeated him in the areas that he was most confident in. Just how strong would he be if he’d been born in the sects?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong was forthright, but that didn’t mean he was a fool.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His personality may be a tad bit crude, but he had a positive quality in that he wholeheartedly accepted and gave precedence to those truly stronger than him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, his acceptance of Jiang Chen as his boss was an action brimming with the truest sincerity.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Aiya!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The door suddenly opened. Taken by surprise, Tang Hong, who was leaning on the doorframe, almost toppled inwards.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? Boss? You’re finally showing your face!” Tang Hong neatly ignored the fact that he’d almost planted his face on the ground and chuckled as he steadied himself, revealing a look of concern for Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The outside world is saying that you’re done for after being beaten down. What fecking bullshit. Boss, you should go, take a walk, and slap the faces of those sons of b*tches.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen chuckled heartily, “Face slapping, is it? I happen to like that a lot. Come, let’s go slap some!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong had been partially joking, and blinked when he saw Jiang Chen taking it seriously. “Slap some faces? Whose?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s slap whoever shows their face.” Jiang Chen was in a great mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a breakthrough and three days of closed door cultivation, he need a place to vent his feelings after such enormous gains.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Slapping whoever shows their face! This was something else alright! </span></i><span style>Tang Hong was infected with the emotion in Jiang Chen’s words and started laughing heartily as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, make a trip to the mission area with me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Boss, you want to request a mission?” Tang Hong asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. My score won’t go up if I don’t do a mission.” Jiang Chen spoke the truth. Although his plan of grinding out points had been unscrupulously interrupted, that didn’t mean that he would give up.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But they said that they would only let you request seven mission in the pill area each month.” Tang Hong still had some anger and frustration in his voice when he mentioned this, plainly still holding a grudge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s not go to the pill area this time. Let’s go to strength of heart.” Jiang Chen smiled leisurely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Hong’s eyes lit up as he slapped his thigh. “Yeah, boss! Your strength of heart is even stronger than mine. I don’t think there aren’t that many in this quadrant who can rival you in terms of strength of heart. Come, I’ll keep you company. Are you planning on making trouble in this area now, boss?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hint of cold intent flashed through his eyes as Jiang Chen smiled faintly, “Hmph. They blacklist me in the pill area, I’ll go smack their faces in the strength of heart and let them know that the truly strong have no weaknesses!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Since you’ve restricted me in the area of pills, I’ll go to the area of strength of heart instead. What can you do about that? Blacklist me again?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It would truly be the greatest joke beneath the heavens if Jiang Chen was blacklisted again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To use underhanded methods twice because of the rise of a secular genius, those preeminent sect geniuses would really have no face left after that.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hells yeah, boss! I’m really looking forward to what expressions the guys who moved against you will have when they find out that you can still farm points in the area of strength of heart.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I haven’t the slightest clue what expression they’ll have, and I have no desire to find out. All I know is that they’ll have to swallow, mouthful by mouthful, all the shit that they spewed out.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s tone was icy. He wasn’t an easy target for anyone, and wasn’t someone who wouldn’t be able to live without the four sects.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was only treating the four sects as a springboard with his participation in the selection. It wasn’t that he couldn’t do without them, and he certainly wouldn’t stop living if he was forced to part with them!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, having been provoked, Jiang Chen wouldn’t play by their rules anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Jiang Chen once again appeared in the sky quadrant, those gossiping with rumors and speculations all shut up. They discovered that they’d sadly been seedy characters for nothing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Look at this fellow’s aura and spirit! Did he look like he’d been knocked down? Was there any sign of him being done for?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmm? That kid’s going to the strength of heart area?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh heh, he needs to gain some points. After all, he’s been banned from the pill area. He needs some points, eh? Otherwise, how ugly will this look?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The strength of heart area? Haha, that’s the hardest area to farm points.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Whatever, let’s wait for him to make a fool out of himself.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen ignored all those murmurs. Using the truth to slap faces was much more convincing than any length of verbal sparring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he arrived in the strength of heart area, no one thought that this point fiend would once again draw back the curtains on the opening act of grinding out points.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone thought it was normal when he finished the level one mission on the first day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Folks thought his strength of heart wasn’t bad after he finished the level two mission on the second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Some couldn’t sit still anymore on the third day because he’d once again completed the mission, easily gaining the forty points of a level three mission.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many pairs of eyeballs were staring at him from behind on the fourth day, wanting to see him fail. Instead, they lost their eyeballs in shock when he passed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A level five mission on the fifth day was once again a success.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To the consternation of all who witnessed it, this cycle repeated itself again and again in the strength of heart area. After disappearing for three days, Jiang Chen the point fiend had once again appeared to test the mentalities of the top geniuses, once again testing the psychological pressure they could endure.</span></p>
