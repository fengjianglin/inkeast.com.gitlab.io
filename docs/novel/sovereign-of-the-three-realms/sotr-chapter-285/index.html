<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 285: A Myriad of Illusions, Heart as a Boulder</span></p>
 <p><span style>Dan Fei?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen shook his head slightly, his heart was as calm as still water.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he’d been slightly taken aback when Dan Fei had appeared, it wasn’t enough to stir any bit of desire of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that he didn’t find women pleasurable, but that the ambiguous feelings between a man and a woman didn’t exist between him and Dan Fei at all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As real as this illusion was, it was still fake.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If the illusion had been Gouyu, that might’ve been enough to mesmerize Jiang Chen for a second, because Gouyu’s style was indeed that bold and straightforward in her loves and hates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, there was none of that kind of draw between Dan Fei and Jiang Chen, and even if there was, this wasn’t something that Dan Fei would’ve done.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hoo!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen exhaled a long breath as his eyes shot towards the front like lightning. His footsteps moved forward resolutely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The illusions around him vanished like the mist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He appeared in the ocean of flowers once again as fragrance wreathed itself around him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There seems to be something in the fragrance of these flowers. They seem to be producing a type of stimulant that gives rise to illusion, controlling one’s body and consciousness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen didn’t linger as he quickly strode forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since he could only move forward on the path of rebirth without turning back, he continued to walk forward without hesitation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He walked roughly four to six hours like so as the night deepened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A soft call suddenly sounded by Jiang Chen’s ears.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen’er.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>What was that? </span></i><span style>Jiang Chen’s ears twitched. He’d heard a voice! The voice was low, but he could hear it very clearly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen’er.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He heard it even more clearly this time.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father’s voice?” Jiang Chen’s thoughts raced as he immediately told himself, </span><i><span style>this is an illusion, it must be an illusion!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Illusions would continuously pop up on the path of rebirth, and phantom sounds as well. Everything was fake!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen kept repeating that to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the more he stressed this to himself, the more real the voice beside his ear became.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen’er, save me, save me!” Jiang Feng’s voice was in obvious pain, as if he was suffering through the agonies of the eighteen hells.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen’er, I found intelligence of your mother in the Upper Eighth Region, but was captured by them. They tortured me with countless methods and they wanted me to reveal where you were… Chen’er, you’re my child. I wouldn’t betray my son even if I died! Never! … ah!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This voice kept surging into Jiang Chen’s ears like a magic spell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Jiang Chen kept reminding himself that all of this was illusion, the voice kept weaving itself around him and it wouldn’t be dismissed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A towering tree suddenly appeared in front of Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone was hanging on the tree. He was covered with wounds as his hands and feet were nailed to the tree with long nails.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Chen’er, don’t come close! Go! Leave! They’re using me as bait to lure you in! You have yet to grow in your strength and you can’t fight them, go!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person hanging on the tree suddenly lifted his head, yelling wildly at Jiang Chen with a head full of wildly bedraggled hair.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was Jiang Feng!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three scabs criss crossed Jiang Feng’s face at the moment, splitting his entire face open and appearing quite frightening.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There wasn’t a single bit of unmarked skin on his body as it was dotted with wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The most horrifying thing was that there were black beetles crawling all over the tree, and long, pliable creatures waving enormous tentacles around, continuously feeding off of Jiang Feng’s blood and nibbling away at his wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only stark white bones were left of Jiang Feng’s calves after a short while.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, a group of black clothed practitioners poured out from the two sides of the great tree, each of them holding the leash of a ferocious beast in their hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All of these beasts were in the origin realm!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Roar!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When the beasts roared, their presence reverberated up to the heavens, as if the entire sky and earth would be shattered by their roars.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Roar!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The fierce beasts howled and started running towards Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Feng used all of his strength to scream hoarsely, “Chen’er, run for your life! Flee!!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Flee?</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>One had to say, this illusion was quite realistic. Even though Jiang Chen kept repeating to himself that this was all fake, his heart still wavered in the moment that he saw his father’s state.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that his heart was weak, but the blood ties between father and son made his heart tremble almost uncontrollably in that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was innate, a resonance between bloodlines that could not be done away with.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However — </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had trained the Boulder’s Heart after all. If it’d been anyone else in this illusion, they might have been gradually consumed by the illusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But Jiang Chen hadn’t believed what was in front of his eyes from beginning to end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His father had indeed gone to the Upper Eighth Region, that was correct.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But a test of this level wasn’t enough to defeat Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he looked at the beasts pouncing towards him, Jiang Chen didn’t back up, but he pushed off his feet savagely and charged at the tree.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“All you illusions, break!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s Divine Aeons Fist smashed heavily into the great tree, sparkling with the light of the mysteries of the ages.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wham!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The mysteries of one cycle of blooming and wilting were contained within that punch, and it too counted as a cycle of rebirth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he flung that punch out, all of the illusions vanished cleanly like clear glass being shattered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The path of rebirth can grasp everyone’s points of weakness alright. The Bridge of Helplessness was testing judgement, the Ocean of Divine Ashes was testing courage, Dan Fei’s appearance tested my resolution, and this was a test of rationality in the face of family.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Every test was able to grasp the weakest part of everyone’s hearts.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This trial was something else, alright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jiang Chen’s Boulder’s Heart was even stronger and it wasn’t defeated by this level of illusion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although he didn’t know how many more tests lay in front of him, he still charged forward without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style> Night passed as the daybreak of the second day arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With the advent of dawn, the psychological pressures of night also began to slowly decrease.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this trial was also an enormous drain on one’s mental resources.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s Boulder’s Heart hadn’t been depleted much, but if the other practitioners hadn’t had special methods to train their mental strength, they would be weaker and weaker in the face of the tests to come if they didn’t sit down and meditate.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The more their mental strength was drained, the more pressure they would feel from future tests.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Once they’d exhausted themselves and lacked sufficient mental strength, they might very well be swallowed by the illusions and become one of the failed statistics.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Jiang Chen had met many tests along the way, this level of testing was not enough to truly impact his mentality. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Boulder’s Heart was now at the seventh level, and his heart was as strong as a boulder. Even a little bit of impact wasn’t enough to affect him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Keep moving forward!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had no stray thoughts in his mind as he moved forward without any interference.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw an awe inspiring palace in the distance after roughly an hour.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The words “Myriad Treasures Pavilion” were written on it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He looked around and saw no other path. He would have to enter the Myriad Treasures Pavilion to continue forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen warned himself that this place was another illusion again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that firmly in mind, he walked into the pavilion. A voice traveled to his ears as soon as he set foot inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Welcome to the Myriad Treasures Pavilion. The pavilion is a wondrous place on the path of rebirth. You can select any method or martial art technique you want here, or any divine weapon, miraculous pill, or rare and exotic creature… remember, you can only choose one out of all the treasures here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>The four forefathers were gathered in a place outside of the path of rebirth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Icemist sighed lightly, “One third of the mundane practitioners have been disqualified up until now. This is indeed a stunning number. It looks like even ten thousand would be hard pressed to remain out of the four hundred thousand to walk the path.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They’d estimated the two thirds would be eliminated on the path as it had layers upon layers of trials. To practitioners with weak strength of the heart, this would be a very, very difficult trial for them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But a third of the group had been disqualified after less than a day. At this rate, the amount of people disqualified may far exceed their original expectations.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Although the path of rebirth is not easy, it just so happens to test the strength of the heart. If they cannot even pass the trial of the heart, then the ones disqualified are just mediocre talents and they have no future ahead of them whatsoever. Since they are trash, what point is there to sigh with regret over them once they are out?” Sunchaser snorted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had no particular feeling towards the numbers of people disqualified.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What he cared more about was how many could remain, and if there were any dark horses that could enter their line of sight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He felt that with the resources in the mundane world, there was no way that any geniuses that could fight for a spot in the final sixteen could exist amongst them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thousandleaf sighed, “They have yet to reach the hardest. The Myriad Treasures Pavilion is the biggest test of all. The last test after the pavilion is even greater. The rate of failure will be highest in the last two tests. I wonder if anyone’s made it to the pavilion yet?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The forefather’s couldn’t see what was happening in the path of rebirth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All was revealed only when the practitioner left the path of rebirth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninelion laughed. “It’s only been less than a day. If someone’s already made it to the Myriad Treasures Pavilion, then their pace is simply too fast. I surmise that many are still dithering in front of the Ocean of Divine Ashes and some are even stuck in front of the Bridge of Helplessness?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Icemist also nodded. “Indeed, if anyone’s made it to the Myriad Treasures Pavilion, then they would be an unparalleled genius. The strength of their heart of dao would be such that we would be hard pressed to find such a genius even in the four great sects?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you lot worried about? We’ll receive a notification as soon as someone passes through the pavilion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>They couldn’t see what was happening on the path of rebirth from the outside world, but the pavilion was the only part of the path of rebirth that had a connection with the outside world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The ancient venerated expert who had created the path of rebirth must have had his reasons for placing the Myriad Treasures Palace here. The outside world would receive notifications as soon as someone passed through the pavilion.</span></p>
