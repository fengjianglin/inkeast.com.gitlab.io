 <p><span style>Chapter 417: Jiang Chen’s Rage</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eh? What’s going on? I can’t move my hands!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me too… this… this person knows some sort of demonic art?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is bad, this is the aura of the spirit realm! Everyone kill him altogether now!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him! He only has a few at his back and there’s hundreds of us, why would we be afraid of him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The few hundred cultivators were arrayed haphazardly in front of the Hall of Healing’s doors and jeering arrogantly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s gaze grew icy as he suddenly glared, the Evil Golden Eye sending out a scintillating beam of light from his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pfft!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The light shot into all the ruffian cultivators’ eyes. The cultivators shook when their eyes came into contact with the light, their bodies quickly losing all feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was like their souls had been frozen over. The surge of power caused their bodies to stiffen. Before too long, the cultivators were as still as statues, as if someone had poured liquid bronze or iron over them to cast lifelike statues.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen waved his hand. “Let’s go in.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gouyu and Huang’er looked at each other, slight shock in their eyes. This was a man who was truly enraged!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This kind of divine art even somewhat amazed Huang’er. In that moment, she felt like she couldn’t see through Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gouyu was even more flabbergasted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the two were concerned about Jiang Chen’s safety and followed him in without hesitation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who is in charge of the Hall of Healing now? Get the hell out here!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s voice boomed like rolling thunder, rocking the interior and exterior of the entire Hall of Healing in an instant. His presence was awe inspiring as his voice echoed endlessly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who dares trespass and act wildly in the Hall of Healing?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kill him!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah, ah!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Two voices had just risen in response before ghastly cries quickly followed. As they fell to the ground, it was obvious that Jiang Chen had destroyed them as soon as they’d called out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen lifted his hand lightly and spoke with a merciless tone, “I will count to five. After five, if those within the Hall aren’t within my line of sight, then I’ll eradicate you all with no exceptions!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Five!” Jiang Chen began the countdown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Four!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Three!” Jiang Chen’s voice counted down in an unhurried manner. His enormous aura kept spreading to every corner of the Hall of Healing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Two!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he counted down to two, those within the Hall of Healing walked out of the shadows because they could no longer bear the pressure of his aura. They walked out to the main lobby.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were well aware that if they really stayed stubbornly inside, this strong newcomer would kill even the dogs and chickens in the Hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all cultivators. They could sense the raging fury behind the aura. This was absolutely something they couldn’t resist.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen pointed with his finger and counted everyone who’d stepped out. His gaze was an arctic chill as it swept the cultivators in front of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You. Step out.” Jiang Chen pointed at someone in a silver robe. He looked to be in middle management.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person cowered as his legs quivered and shook. He didn’t dare not come out in the face of Jiang Chen’s summons and so his teeth chattered wildly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He-hello.” The silver robed individual couldn’t even speak properly in the face of Jiang Chen’s enormous aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you in charge of the Hall of Healing?” Jiang Chen’s tone was remote.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“N-no…” The silver robed individual was so frightened that he was on the verge of wetting himself. “It’s… Manager Lie is in charge.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is he?” Jiang Chen continued to turn up the pressure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The silver robed individual’s teeth continued to chatter as he broke out in a cold sweat. He couldn’t control himself fully beneath Jiang Chen’s enormous pressure. It was as if there was a power in this young man’s eyes that was forcing him to submit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s… he’s not in the lobby. He probably didn’t come out yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen nodded lightly, revealing a meaningful smile. He sent out his consciousness and began his search.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Having reached his particular level with Psychic’s Head, a mere Hall of Healing was naturally incapable of escaping the reach of his consciousness. He quickly identified three more people hiding in the shadows of the Hall of Healing who had yet to emerge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er, at Jiang Chen’s side, suddenly smiled. It was apparent that her consciousness had also detected in that moment that there were some who’d yet to emerge.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Jiang, Huang’er has a bit of a history with the Hall of Healing as well. Allow me to help.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er spread out her hands after speaking. A guzheng appeared in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er’s white, slender, jade fingers brushed softly across the surface of the instrument as several notes sounded.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The music was full of only faint killing intent in the beginning, but quickly gathered into a wild intent that roiled like the raging seas. It surged towards three corners, forcing out the three in hiding.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er was only trying her hand at this. Even Gouyu couldn’t see through the profound mysteries within that moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen however was extremely shocked. The deployment of this art seemed simple, but it embodied enormous mystical theories within it . Huang’er could actually control the direction of the notes. This kind of control over sound was something that Jiang Chen knew that he didn’t have at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Waves of horrifying howls resounded from several secret chambers not too long after. The three fellows were covering their ears as they ran out shrieking and wailing. From their bedraggled appearance, they seemed as though they would collapse any second.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Huang’er smiled faintly and stopped when she’d achieved her purpose, not intending on stealing the limelight. She smiled slightly, “Sir Jiang, Huang’er can only do so much. The rest is up to you!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Many thanks for Miss Huang’er’s just act of aid.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It wasn’t that Jiang Chen was unable to force these three fellows out, but he wouldn’t be able to do so as easily as Huang’er had just done so.</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of the three was wearing a golden robe and looked quite well off. In this moment however, he seemed quite panic stricken and worse for the wear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You must be that Manager Lie?” Jiang Chen’s gaze zeroed in on the man with the golden robe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Lie finally regained his senses when the music notes disappeared, but fear filled his eyes. He looked upon Jiang Chen, “Just who are you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen shook his head lightly. “I’m the one asking the questions today. Now, if you can’t give me a satisfactory answer to any of my questions, I’ll relieve you of one of your body parts.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“First question is, where is Song Tianxing and the others?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s consciousness locked tightly on him, not allowing a single false word to pass his lips.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Lie stammered, “Th-they… they all left. They sold us the Hall of Healing at a high price… Ah!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He screamed hastily as he clapped his hand to his left ear, discovering it gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled, a chilling sight, “One more time. Where is Song Tianxing and the others?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Lie was scared out of his wits as he tried to stop the blood from gushing out his left ear. He almost fainted. “They… they…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pfft!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen raised his arm. The enormous metal essence power came slicing out of his hand like blades, as fast as shooting stars, cutting off the man’s right ear as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!!” The ghastly screech rang out again. Manager Lie’s pant cuffs grew damp as he wet himself in pure fright.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One last chance. If you don’t answer properly, then the next thing to hit the ground won’t be your ears, but your head.” There wasn’t the slightest hint of emotion in Jiang Chen’s tone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I… I’ll tell you! I’ll tell you! I’ll tell you everything!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>No matter how proud he was, Manager Lie could no longer hold on in the face of a life or death crisis. He didn’t doubt the harbinger of death in front of him was speaking the truth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We… took over the Hall of Healing. Song Tianxing wouldn’t cooperate, so we killed him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You?” Jiang Chen laughed coldly. “You wouldn’t have such guts by yourself alone. Who’s behind this?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We came on orders to seize the three pill recipes of the Hall of Healing. The one who ordered us was the crown prince of the Shangyang Kingdom.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Shangyang Kingdom?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen flicked a glance at Gouyu. He didn’t know as much about the sixteen kingdoms as Gouyu did.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gouyu hastened to say, “The Shangyang Kingdom is one of the four great kingdoms, just like the Skylaurel Kingdom. Shangyang Kingdom’s relationship with the Purple Sun Sect is the same as the Skylaurel Kingdom’s with the Precious Tree Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s face completely darkened when he heard these words. “The Purple Sun Sect!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyebrow arching, Jiang Chen suppressed the flames of fury in his heard and asked, “Why did the crown prince of the Shangyang Kingdom set his sights on the Hall of Healing?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>How would Manager Lie still have the desire to resist now? He spilled out everything he knew like pouring beans from a bamboo container.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Shangyang Kingdom has been quite envious of the Hall of Healing crazily reaping wealth like it has in the last couple of years with the three recipes. The crown prince has long set his sights on them. He received some sort of hint from the Purple Sun Sect this time saying that the Hall of Healing had lost its backer, so there would be no fear of retaliation. Therefore, the crown prince finally struck with full force after planning for a very long time in order to take the profits from the Hall of Healing.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was normal for such a rich mark to be targeted after a while. However, since they’d successfully taken over the Hall of Healing, why slaughter the Jiang family clan?</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was obvious that something else was at play here.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’d already secured the Hall of Healing and the three pill recipes. Why slaughter the Jiang family clan?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Manager Lie quickly responded, “I didn’t participate in the slaughter. My authority is too low and I have no right either to inquire about the reasons behind this. It’s said that those above weren’t satisfied with just three pill recipes. They seemed to feel that there would be much more treasure in the Jiang family, this was why…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>All the various clues slowly formed into a clear bigger picture.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it came down to it, this half year had been when he’d been trapped in the Eternal Spirit Mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The other had made their move at precisely this time. Jiang Chen would never believe that the Purple Sun Sect wasn’t behind all of this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Purple Sun Sect, the Shangyang Kingdom…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fury raged in his heart. He swept a cold glance across the Hall of Healing, “Last question. Where is Jiang Zheng?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Zheng? He was taken to the Shangyang Kingdom. It seems that there are people who want to interrogate him specifically.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Zheng was Jiang Chen’s confidante and steward, yet he had lived and been taken away. What did this mean? This meant that all of this had been directed at him, Jiang Chen!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come, we go to the Shangyang Kingdom.” Jiang Chen said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gouyu and Huang’er looked at each other. They knew that the flames of fury had been thoroughly stoked in Jiang Chen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was likely that the Shangyang Kingdom would be in for a terrible time after this. There would likely even be countless numbers of heads that rolled in the Purple Sun Sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those in the Hall of Healing found it incredulous when Jiang Chen and the others walked out. They had escaped disaster just like this?</span></p>
 <p><span style>One of them laughed coldly. “Sonnuvab*tch! Scaring me half to death. He's just a silver spear tip, good for showing and nothing else. Hmph, he must've been scared outta his mind after hearing the Purple Sun Sect eh?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. Who dares provoke the Purple Sun Sect in the sixteen kingdom alliance?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who'd lost their wits from fright earlier now all puffed out their chests and began talking tough, as if the sniveling wretches earlier hadn't been them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, someone cried out. “Stop talking, do you hear that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone quieted down and focused on their hearing. They seemed to hear scurrying sounds coming from underground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the ground began trembling violently!</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The floorboards burst open as countless golden streaks surged out like a fountain, spreading out as if locusts. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The numerous Goldbiter Rats charged out and bit whoever they saw. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Agonized screams filled the air in an instant as rivers of blood flowed. </span></p>
