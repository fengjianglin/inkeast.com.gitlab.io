<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 324: The Hundred Challenges Arena</span></p>
 <p><span style>A night passed. Jiang Chen opened his eyes to revel in the feeling of a new day as sunlight streamed into his room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The morning sunshine and mountain breeze gave one a very homely feeling. However, each candidate also knew that the true challenge had arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had also seen some success after practicing the “Nine Transformations” for a night. When he had first called upon the essence of metal power and focused it onto his skin, he’d only felt a slight pricking pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This pain wasn’t noticeable at first, but as his training deepened, it felt like tens of thousands of embroidery needles were constantly stabbing into his skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although this level of pain wasn’t enough to cause someone to break down, it still didn’t feel good by any means. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was someone who could endure pain very well, and he didn’t even crease his brow when continuing to use the essence of metal power in order to further refine his skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As time went on, his skin grew used to the tempering from the essence of metal and the sensation of pain slowly decreased.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He knew that no art was easily trained. There would be countless inevitable trials and tribulations on the path of cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When it came to refining the body, there was a commonly accepted principle in the world of martial dao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who lacked great determination would not be able to endure refinement of the body. Refining the body was a kind of self torture, and sufficient courage was needed to place oneself within the eighteenth level of hell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were those with ordinary potential who fought their way to the top, step by step, just through refining their bodies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It could be said that the art of body refinement had cleaved a new path to attain the peak of martial dao for those with ordinary potential.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, it was a path that was much more difficult than ordinary cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Those who could truly make it to the peak of body refinement were as rare as phoenix feathers and dragon scales.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, once a cultivator made it to the peak of body refinement, their battle strength was, without a doubt, much stronger than their peers of similar cultivation levels.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fierce battle strength, incredible explosive power, and a death-defying fighting spirit were all traits unique to body refiners.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The first level of Jiang Chen’s “Nine Transformations of the Demons and Gods” was just to temper his skin. All the pain that he felt was just the smallest taste of things to come.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The higher his level grew, the tougher the trials would be on his body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was also well aware that since he’d chosen to refine his body, this meant that he would have to be prepared to accept the pain and suffering of eighteen levels of hell as well.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jiang Chen wasn’t an ordinary body refiner in this regard. He had many methods that could help him decrease his pain a bit in the process of refining his body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Knock knock knock.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Knocking sounds came from the door. Judging from the footsteps, he knew that it was his neighbor, Xiao Fei.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He opened the door to reveal candidate number two’s face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Boulder, it’s about time to assemble. We should go.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen nodded, as he knew the rules.</span></p>
 <p><span style>All candidates had to report to the Hundred Challenges Arena every morning during these three months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Arena was built in the core area of the mystic spirit quadrant, with a hundred rings built within. Each candidate had to take their place within the Arena every morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to the rules, the successive sixteen hours starting from the morning<sup><a id="ref1" href="#fn1">1</a></sup> of each day were open for challenges. All candidates had to remain within the Arena and could not leave.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because each candidate was not only a challenger, but also someone to be challenged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This rule did not apply after a candidate had been challenged three times in the same day, and they were allowed to leave first.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their name would then be struck off the list and they would no longer be able to receive more challenges that day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was a type of protection for the candidates.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Otherwise, if one was unlucky and was selected seven or eight times a day, they’d die of exhaustion, even if they weren’t beaten to death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the same time, each candidate had to complete one challenge a day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By ruling that that each candidate had to complete a challenge a day, this ensured that the hundred challenges would be able to be completed within three months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen exited his room and left the door unlatched. Although he hadn't left anything inside, he still didn't want anyone coming in to disturb his room. Therefore, Jiang Chen left a few marks around the doorway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If anyone moved his door and entered his room, he’d find out when he returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Boulder, how are your preparations?” Xiao Fei asked probingly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled faintly, “Not bad, you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Fei barely mustered a smile, “My strength is far less than Brother Boulder’s. I’ll try my best.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His attitude was quite humble, but Jiang Chen could tell that Xiao Fei’s true strength was absolutely not what he’d displayed thus far.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them walked out to discover that the other six sect disciples had left quite early.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked like they’d slipped out early in order to avoid any awkwardness. They were deathly afraid of bumping into Jiang Chen and being ordered around like a servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As sect disciples, they couldn’t let go of the pride rooted in their bones.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Fei smiled, “These fellows look like they’re truly afraid. They left early and didn’t dare meet with Brother Boulder. What a vindicating feeling!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled slightly, and felt that although it was possible that they were scared, he didn’t feel that these fellows would accept their new lots quite so easily. It was likely that more developments were in store.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, just as Jiang Chen had said, they could resist, but the price of resisting was far worse than the price of being a servant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took them fifteen minutes to make it to the Hundred Challenges Arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A hundred elevated rings stood in the vast expanse of the Hundred Challenges Arena, giving one an impressive and awe inspiring feeling.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Candidates of various levels were already sitting cross legged around the Arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Jiang Chen and Xiao Fei wore the uniforms of secular disciples, they stood out greatly as they walked across the ground. Xiao Fei looked around and discovered that the other ordinary practitioners were all cowering within the corners. It looked like they’d been thoroughly whipped into shape by the sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When they saw Jiang Chen and Xiao Fei appear, a strange light appeared in some of their eyes. It seemed that they were waiting to watch a good show, and that their hearts would be assuaged only when they saw Jiang Chen firmly driven into the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen could discern their thoughts from their eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What a pathetic bunch. What are they doing in a selection if they don’t dare to retort against these sect disciples? Just because they’ve had some tough times, they want to see us go through the same. They don't even have a bottom line of a decent human being. These people deserve to be stomped underfoot.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen originally had a few traces of sympathy for these secular disciples, but that little bit of sympathy vanished completely when he saw the expression and looks in their eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Fei also seemed to detect the enmity coming from them at all sides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sect disciples all had unfriendly looks on their faces. It was obvious that word of what had happened in their courtyard had spread amongst the sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brother Boulder, it looks like we have trouble.” Xiao Fei said lowly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen creased his brow, “You can go off on your own if you’re afraid of trouble. You can even kiss up to the sect disciples, I won’t stop you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Fei chuckled, “I don’t have much to my name, but I’ve got a stubborn temper. The more they want to suppress me, the more I won’t let them succeed. Brother Boulder, you want to get rid of me? Heh heh, I’m not moving!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was in ordinary times, Jiang Chen wouldn’t have cared what this fellow was thinking. But in comparison to the other disciples all submitting to the sect disciples, at least candidate number two had some self pride and hadn’t bowed his head to the sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, Jiang Chen didn’t feel any distaste towards him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, kid. Come over here.” An impolite voice suddenly sounded from the left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen didn’t even seem to hear the voice as he continued walking forward without the slightest pause in his footsteps.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hey! I mean you two! The two with the masks! I’ve heard you’re the first and second place candidates in the first selection? Tsk tsk, aren't you cocky eh!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>If Jiang Chen answered these idiotic provocations every time they came up, he’d never have time to do anything else.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, the more he ignored them, the more annoyed they became. A figure flashed as it blocked Jiang Chen’s way, with arrogance and domination written all over his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, you’re cocky! If a sect disciple is calling out to you, it means we are honoring you! Who the hell do you think you are to be so discourteous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Piss off.” Jiang Chen had only two words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? You… you told me to piss off?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen said no more and reached out a hand, grabbing the other’s shirt with incredible speed and sending out extreme strength with the shake of his hand. He flung the other out twenty or so meters, like he was throwing away a dead animal.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The person didn’t even have time to react before crashing down helter skelter over the ground, the very epitome of bedraggedness.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it wasn’t for the rules, Jiang Chen would’ve sent him flying with one slap.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the person was in a sore state, he wasn’t injured. His face was beet red as he’d just been tossed aside like trash beneath the stares of everyone assembled. This was howling shame!</span></p>
 <p><span style>To add insult on injury, Xiao Fei actually started applauding, as if craving nothing more than to stir up chaos. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wonderful, wonderful! What a nice Tripped Dog Form, right on!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sect disciple almost spat out blood when he heard these words. Tripped Dog Form! This was insinuating that he was a dog!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Brat, who are you calling a dog?? The sect disciple flew into a rage but was still wary of Jiang Chen and so didn’t dare to charge forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xiao Fei chuckled, “Whoever blocks the way is the dog, do you need me to teach you that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sect disciple howled with indignation as another disciple stepped out at this time. His expression was remote as he actually looked a bit similar to senior brother Cheng. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me introduce myself, I’m Cheng Zhen. I heard from my younger cousin that you were quite arrogant in the courtyard yesterday. I don’t know what you, a mere secular disciple, have to be arrogant about. I warn you, if you dare do anything to my cousin, I will make you regret arriving in this world."</span></p>
 <p><span style>Threats upon threats! To blatantly threaten another in front of the Hundred Challenges Arena, these sect disciples were truly unbridled.</span></p>
