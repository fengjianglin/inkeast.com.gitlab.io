<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 414: Dan Fei’s Letter</span></p>
 <p><span style>Towards the end, even the king of the Skylaurel Kingdom was motivated to action as he brought a hundred civil and military officials to the Jiang manor to offer his congratulations. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the proclaimed purpose was to offer felicitations, everyone’s thoughts were actually the same. They wanted to strike up a relationship with Jiang Chen, fawn over him, and pay public tribute to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was no question about it. Jiang Chen’s position was higher than even the king’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As a result of his foundation and identity, the king of the Skylaurel Kingdom wasn’t someone who would be afraid even when in the presence of an ordinary elder of the Precious Tree Sect. </span></p>
 <p><span style>However, a genius like Jiang Chen wasn’t someone that an ordinary sect elder could measure up to. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In this half year, numerous versions of the various legends surrounding Jiang Chen had arisen, depicting his performance in the selection as extravagantly as flowers falling from the sky, unaccountably magical.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although these legends had been added to, his string of titles was very real.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The champion of the first secular selection, champion of the mystic and earth quadrants, and victor of the final matches, he’d become the undisputed final champion through destroying powerful opponents along the way and killing Long Juxue in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue had become a legendary genius in the sixteen kingdom alliance because of her innate constitution.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, this legendary genius had been unable to escape her fate of being cleaved to death with one stroke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That single blow had been enough to explain everything.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not to mention that forefather Thousandleaf, someone who’d never concerned himself with secular matters, had personally spoken that the sect would protect the Jiang family without regard to whether Jiang Chen was alive or dead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From this, it showed just how much the Precious Tree Sect valued Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And now that Jiang Chen had emerged from his confinement, he was as if a dragon returning to the seas, destined to herald a new myth of a legendary genius in the sixteen kingdom alliance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Could they refrain from fawning over such a character?</span></p>
 <p><span style>If they missed this chance, who knew if Jiang Chen would come back to the Skylaurel Kingdom again? Even if he did, when would he do so?</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was definitely their best chance to get into his good graces.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen obviously hadn’t expected such a development either. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the Jiang manor was spacious, when the nobles and powerful of the entire kingdom arrived on his doorstep, with all of them bringing their children, it made the scene entirely too raucous. These visitors itched to bring the entire younger generation from the families so that their young could learn from Jiang Chen. Even receiving one or two pointers would result in lifelong benefits.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The royal family had to step in and maintain order due to the explosive enthusiasm. They put on a royal banquet to welcome Jiang Chen, inviting all the nobles of the kingdom to attend, but limiting each family to two people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even so, the atmosphere was quite fervent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had long since grown accustomed to this. It was a common sight to see people flock to those with power.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He didn’t refuse these arrangements and interacted closely with fourth prince Ye Rong at the banquet, using his actions to proclaim to those present that he still supported Ye Rong and was his strong shield.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ye Rong’s gains were the greatest in this regard. Everyone up and down the capital knew that Ye Rong’s position of heir apparent couldn’t be touched.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even the king himself didn't dare to make any more changes to Ye Rong’s position again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Azure Heaven Southern Palace, Qingyang Valley, and Myriad Treasures Palace had a ball of a time at the banquet thanks to their close relationship with Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Palace head Ning in particular was even more emotional. She was deeply thankful that she hadn’t married off her daughter to Xiao Yu of the Northern Palace and had chosen Qiao Baishi instead. Otherwise, she’d be so eaten away with regret right now to the extent that her very insides would be green.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Myriad Treasures Palace was close to Jiang Chen because of Jiang Yu. Vice head Shi Xiaoyao was full of compliments for Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Thanks to Fei Xuan becoming an elder, Qingyang Valley had abruptly risen to the head of the four sites. All of this was thanks to Jiang Chen, so he naturally held great admiration for Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Apart from the four sites, general director Shangguan Yi of the Dragonteeth Guard was also deeply appreciative and greatly thankful that he hadn’t lost his wits to stand with vice director Yang Zhao originally. Otherwise, where would he be in this banquet today?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He likely wouldn’t even be sitting in his position as general director still.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The banquet ended amidst a carefree atmosphere, with some feeling unsatisfied coming up to further heighten their relationships with Jiang Chen. Jiang Chen didn’t hold himself aloof as he responded to all of them politely.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen gathered again with those closest to him when all the guests had left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Prince Ye Rong sighed, “Young master Chen, I count as one who tapped into your potential more in the Skylaurel Kingdom, but I must admit that I never thought you would make it to this point.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Tian Shao didn’t say anything similar, his faintly smiling expression indicated that he quite agreed with the prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They were all companions in adversity, and so the atmosphere was quite lighthearted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen raised his cup, “To those difficult times of misfortunes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone laughed heartily and raised their cups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Tang Long was sitting next to Tian Shao. After a few years of development, he had grown into his own and been promoted to commander. However, he was even more respectful now when he saw Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His life had been utterly changed by Jiang Chen. With his grassroots origins, him becoming a commander in the Dragonteeth Guard felt almost like a dream. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Qianli of the Azure Heaven Southern Palace, Prince Ye Rong’s confidante, was also present. He had attended Ye Chonglou’s birthday banquet along with Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When Lin Qianli had first met Jiang Chen, he’d actually been a bit opposed to the latter and even looked down on him. Now that circumstances have changed with the passage of time, he could only sigh with emotion at what had happened between the two of them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master Chen, I, Lin Qianli, have never much conceded to anyone else in my life. I admire you from the depths of my heart and concede to you.” Lin Qianli was proud, but had to accept the situation in the face of a true expert.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone laughed again and raised their cups.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, everyone was well aware that Jiang Chen’s path would depart from this place after tonight, and the trajectory of their lives would be greatly different in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even if their friendship didn’t fade, their interactions would be few and far in between.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After they’d finished drinking, Prince Ye Rong personally saw Jiang Chen to the door and spoke in a sincere tone. “Young master Chen, your future is boundless with this departure. If you have free time one day, come and take a stroll in the Skylaurel Kingdom. The doors to the capital are always open for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen took a look at Ye Rong and then at Tian Shao and Tang Long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He saw that their faces were all filled with sincerity.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve been through thick and thin. Come find me at the Precious Tree Sect if anything comes up.” Jiang Chen had wanted to discuss the disadvantageous straits that the sixteen kingdom alliance was in with them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, telling them this now would only increase their worries. Therefore, he decided to keep it to himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, if any major changes occurred in the bigger picture now, it wasn’t anything that the power of a secular kingdom could handle.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he took his leave, Jiang Chen walked over to the Tutor Manor. After two years, Jiang Chen wanted to see if the old tutor had succeeded in assailing the origin realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, when he arrived, he saw some of the tutor’s personal guards instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sir Jiang Chen? The lordmaster is still in closed door cultivation and has yet to emerge.” The guard had obviously heard of Jiang Chen’s legends and spoke quite respectfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Yet to emerge?” Jiang Chen smiled faintly. “It seems like the lordmaster has gained much from this time’s closed door training.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then looked inside the door but didn’t see Dan Fei. He was slightly surprised by that. Dan Fei and the old tutor mutually depended on each other for survival. Why would she be absent during this time?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is Miss Dan Fei absent as well?” Jiang Chen was curious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The personal guard slapped his forehead. “Me and my goldfish memory. I was too agitated upon seeing Sir Jiang Chen and almost forgot the most important matter. Miss Dan Fei has left the capital for almost a year now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Left the capital?” Jiang Chen couldn't imagine at all how Dan Fei would leave the capital when the old tutor was in closed door cultivation.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, Miss Dan Fei also left a letter saying to give it to you if Sir Jiang Chen came looking for her. If you didn’t come, we were to burn it after three years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The personal guard took out a sealed letter from his clothes and handed it over.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen accepted it but didn’t open it. He responded. “If the lordmaster emerges from closed door cultivation or if Miss Dan Fei returns, please tell them that I’ve already returned to the Precious Tree Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The personal guard nodded his head rapidly, “Yes, yes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen didn’t want to bother the old tutor’s closed door cultivation. He felt slightly lost as he walked beneath the moonlight, threading through the alleyways dotted with shadows from the trees. For some reason, he fell into a despondent mood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He suddenly recalled Dan Fei’s letter and opened it beneath the moonlight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The letter was very simple, there was only—</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even thousands and thousands of words are insufficient, I will never regret pining for my love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s fingertips trembled. How would he not understand these words? This was Dan Fei expressing her emotions and her love for him through the letter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was speechless in that moment. When he thought about the various interactions he’d had in the Skylaurel Kingdom, he was a bit surprised. Logically speaking, how could Dan Fei be so straightforward with her headstrong personality?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the meaning behind these words were easy to decipher, but there seemed to be some deep meaning hidden within that Jiang Chen had yet to decipher.</span></p>
 <p><span style>From the calligraphy of these words, they seemed to conceal a thousand matters weighing on one’s mind, such as utmost embarrassing and awkward situations. As if there were a thousand words the speaker wanted to say, but could only pen these few words in the end.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen looked at the words but couldn’t comprehend them in the end. Just what had happened to Dan Fei that she would suddenly confess her feelings with such ardor and so openly?</span></p>
 <p><span style>These words obviously had great emotions behind them, and would arise only after one’s yearning had reached to an extreme.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, their relationship had never seemed to progress to this step. Dan Fei’s face and words rose in Jiang Chen’s mind, but he still couldn’t make sense of things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, he was an open minded person. He would disdain or hold Dan Fei’s feelings in contempt. He put the letter back and stored the letter in his storage ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was already the middle of the night when he returned to the Jiang manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, everyone had yet to sleep. Xue Tong was the first to report the happenings of these two years when Jiang Chen returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Young master, the Hall of Healing in the Eastern Kingdom would send a share of profits every three months from the three pills we left them. However, this has suddenly stopped in the past half year. Perhaps something might have happened to them? They used to be very punctual.”</span></p>
