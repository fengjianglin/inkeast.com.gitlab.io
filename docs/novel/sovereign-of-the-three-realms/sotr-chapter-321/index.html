<div id="chapter-content" class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 321: Jiang Chen Demonstrates His Power</span></p>
 <p><span style>As he felt the explosive enmity from the yard, there weren’t that many ripples that rocked Jiang Chen’s heart.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was said that dragons did not cohabit with snakes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>According to Jiang Chen’s personality, these fourth level candidates didn’t warrant the slightest attention from him. If it wasn’t thanks to the rules, how would he share the same roof with them?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Given the circumstances, although he was unwilling, he didn’t turn his face away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, how could the enmity of these fellows scare him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He pointed his foot forward and kicked the door open. Jiang Chen’s eyes swept the inside and noticed that the yard was rather spacious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two rooms on each side of the courtyard, with eight in total. It was obvious that each candidate would have their own.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was about to set foot into the courtyard when a wide figure came walking over. The figure immediately asked unceremoniously, “Who the hell are you to dare barge into where cultivators live?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The voice was crude and gruff, belonging to that Brother Tiger that the others had mentioned earlier.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen flicked a faint glance around and noticed the other five living in this residence had all gathered. The others were split into two sides and had fanned out, subtly preventing them from advancing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you deaf? I’m speaking to you!” A sect disciple’s superiority complex made Brother Tiger feel like he’d been gravely insulted when he saw that Jiang Chen’s gaze was distant, as if the latter couldn’t even be bothered to look at him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And who the hell are you? Haven’t you heard of the saying that good dogs don’t get underfoot? With you blocking the door like this, those who know will know you live here, those who don’t will think you’re the guard dog.” Jiang Chen smiled coolly.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen then creased his brow and flourished his sleeves like he was shooing away irritating flies in front of him, shouting, “Move, get out of my way!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brother Tiger was quite stalwart, big, and tall. When he saw Jiang Chen flourish his sleeves, the former leered and prepared to teach Jiang Chen a lesson.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, in the moment that Jiang Chen’s sleeves waved, Brother Tiger only felt that a mountain seemed to be pressing down on him. His breathing became labored and he subconsciously moved to the side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This movement had seemed to be in accordance with Jiang Chen’s words. Jiang Chen had told him to move, so he’d moved.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen passed by him and smiled faintly, “Seems like you’ve got a brain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Brother Tiger’s face flushed beet red as he exhaled explosively before finally recovering his breath. He was utterly baffled by what had just happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He roared out, “Brat, stop right there!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen took a few more steps forward and saw that the other five sect disciples were still standing in front of him, blocking off all directions. It looked like they had no intention of letting Jiang Chen by.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen suddenly paused and stood in the center, a smile playing about his lips as he surveyed his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He crossed his arms in front of his chest, smiling faintly. “Alright, out with it. Who’s the boss here?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen could also tell that this Brother Tiger was a minion. He’d been egged on by others to stick his head out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In actuality, this fellow was absolutely not the boss of this residence. Someone who was all brawn and no brains would never be the boss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen looked around and locked his gaze on a fair skinned young man standing to the south.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This person had had a remote expression with some traces of a smile on his face the whole time. The hint of restraint and pride in his eyes was the epitome of a sect disciple.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It looked like this person was the true boss of the courtyard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, when Jiang Chen looked to him, everyone else’s gaze also flitted to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This made Jiang Chen even more certain that he was the true leader of this residence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man’s brow creased slightly as Jiang Chen locked his gaze onto him, seemingly quite displeased with Jiang Chen’s gaze. He seemed to feel that this was a deep offense to him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“An ordinary practitioner dares to size me up in this manner?! What a country bumpkin, completely lacking in manners!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Snorting softly, the young man said lightly, “I’ve heard that the top ten of the secular disciples have been assigned to the mystic quadrant. They were rather lucky. However, didn’t the overseer of the first selection teach you what to do once you entered? Didn’t he teach you that you needed to keep your head down in front of the sect disciples?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It looks like you had moved the winds and rain in the first selection and brought that feeling of superiority into the second selection, hmm?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man smiled coldly and stared frostily at Jiang Chen, his tone remote.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Listen up! This young sir will represent the sect disciples and give you a lesson. Ordinary practitioners will always be ordinary practitioners. You’re destined to roll around in the dust of the mundane world. Even if you’re lucky and enter the sect, you’ll only be at the bottom for others to step on, order around, and act as a background for. Remember, whether here or within the sects, you’re always lower than others!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man stretched out a hand and said, “Now, I’ll announce the five rules of this residence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“One, the two of you will live in the two rooms to the north. You are to never approach the other rooms without our orders.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Second, the two of you will be in charge of all the errands in this residence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Third, you will hand over to me your monthly stipend and rewards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fourth, you are servants here and will answer when summoned. You will be punished with kneeling the first time you are remiss, a beating the second time, and death the third!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fifth…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen suddenly laughed and interrupted the other person’s flowing speech, smiling faintly, “Does this mean you really are the boss of this place?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone immediately cried out next to him, “Kid, what bullshit are you spouting? My senior brother Cheng is of the fourth level spirit realm! If it wasn’t for the fact that he only recently broke through, he’d absolutely be able to be worthy of the earth quadrant with his current level of cultivation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh heh, kid, recognize the situation you’re in. If senior brother Cheng says something in this residence, no one else dares to say anything else. If you understand the rules and play your part as a servant well, you’ll be able to weather the next three months well. If not…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen spread out his hands and asked, “Senior brother Cheng is it? Which room do you live in?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The young man frowned, seemingly above answering Jiang Chen’s question.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Someone immediately toadied up to him and said, “The south side is king. Senior brother Cheng lives in the southern room, of course!:</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior brother Cheng had a face full of lofty self pride and didn’t speak up otherwise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen nodded and said to senior brother Cheng, “Go and pack your things. I’m commandeering the southern room.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene quieted down instantly when he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had flabbergasted expressions, wondering if they’d misheard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What? He’d told senior brother Cheng to pack his things because he was commandeering the room? Had… had this brat gone mad?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kid, are… are you crazy? Senior brother Cheng has just explained the five rules to you, are you deaf and didn’t hear them?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ordinary disciples and country bumpkins have no idea of the immensity of the universe. Senior brother Cheng, it looks like there’s a need to make them understand the rules!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s face grew cold. “Rules? Who made the rules? I only have one rule. Whoever offends me will pay the price!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen paid no mind to these idiots after he spoke, and shot into the southern room like lightning. His speed was so fast that no one caught a clear glimpse of him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a short while, the luggage within the southern room were all thrown out, landing heavily on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen walked out and waved at candidate number two. “The room has been cleaned, do you want to come live in it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Candidate number two had already seemed to know that Jiang Chen would be so fierce. He chuckled and walked towards the southern room without a trace of fear.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This scene completely shell shocked the six sect disciples.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior brother Cheng’s pale face immediately flushed red. “Brat, you don’t care when you die huh?!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled faintly, “Since the southern room is good, why can we not take up residence within it when you can?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior brother Cheng shook in his rage, “You ordinary ant! You filthy dog! Are you fit to live in the southern room?! Inferior beings should live in inferior rooms. The northern rooms are where trash like you should live!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“However, you’ve now deeply offended me. It’s too late even if you want to live in the northern rooms. I now announce that you can only sleep in the courtyard!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior brother Cheng’s tone was highly arrogant, as if his every word and sentence could determine everyone’s life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled faintly instead of growing angry when he heard these words. He advanced slowly towards senior brother Cheng.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re right, inferior beings should live in inferior rooms. Therefore, the northern rooms are really suited for you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen’s aura increased with each step he took.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d destroyed even a golem at the peak of the fifth level spirit realm earlier. What did he fear from a fourth level disciple?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Jiang Chen’s level of cultivation was only at the fourth level spirit realm, thanks to a spirit ocean crafted by the Five Dragons Opening Heavens Pill and his various fortuitous encounters, Jiang Chen’s current aura was likely even on par with a cultivator at the peak of the earth spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That a minor character who’d just entered the earth spirit realm kept threatening him — this naturally ticked off Jiang Chen by quite a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He might have been able to overlook provocation, but this fellow had been spouting off words such as “trash”, “inferior”, and “village bumpkins” one after the other. Although Jiang Chen didn’t want to actually fight with him, he knew that if he didn’t put this fellow down, he’d been in for no end of provocation in the future.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As opposed to making concessions to keeping the peace, he might as well settle things once and for all today and set the tone for what’s to happen in the residence. From today forth, he, Jiang Chen, would be the boss of this place, and his word was law!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Whoever ran afoul of him would be in for it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>As Jiang Chen advanced, senior brother Cheng only felt a slight pressure weigh on him. His breathing then became labored, and then he realized that his spirit ocean was being continuously compressed like a balloon, in danger of exploding at any moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Senior brother Cheng’s face changed greatly as great drops of perspiration dripped down from his forehead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen was expressionless as he continued to speak noncommittally, “Senior brother Cheng is it? A sect disciple hmm? Five rules huh? Out of all that, I only ask, whose word is law now?”</span></p>
