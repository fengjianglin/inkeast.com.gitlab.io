<div class="fr-view"> 
 <p><span style>Chapter 435: The Momentum of Defeat</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo had learned from Li Yuan’s match and decided to focus his efforts on defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chen was strutting on about counting the match as a loss if any of the three sects could hold out for longer than ten moves. Although Wang Tuo intensely despised Wu Chen’s arrogance, given Li Yuan’s previous showing, Wang Tuo didn’t dare take things lightly and so decided to first make it past ten moves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he saw Wang Tuo’s posture, a trace of contempt filled Wu Chen’s eyes. He grasped at his waist and pulled out a whip.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This whip was a good ten meters long and hummed through the air when Wu Chen shook it slightly. It was as if he held a legendary green water dragon in his hand. Once infused with spirit qi, it seemed to come alive, giving off a vitality as indomitable as a dragon and as lively as a tiger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Will cowering in your shell take you past ten moves?” Wu Chen smile’s was a cold thing as he stepped forward, the long whip drawing out a beautiful arc through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whip whistled through the air and churned up countless currents of air, sending rocks and dust flying and closing off all paths.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo had wanted to close in on Wu Chen using a pincer tactic with his contract beast, but that whip’s movements sealed any opening he could find.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The attacks of a long whip were very difficult to defend against, especially as its attack range was quite large. It would be a nightmare to a defender once the attacker started exerting himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo was suffering unspeakably at the moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d thought that Wu Chen would continue using those mysterious gloves and had planned on employing a defensive strategy. He hadn’t thought that Wu Chen would have so many tricks up his sleeve and would take out a long whip instead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whip continuously ate away the space he could move as it cracked down. Spirit power formed into shadows of the whip as each image severed the air further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo could only feel that his range of movement growing more and more constricted. At this moment, he knew that his downfall would be the same as Li Yuan and he wouldn’t make it past even one move.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He whistled and exchanged some messages with his contract beast. Wang Tuo suddenly howled lowly as the contract beast actually drilled into the ground, vanishing without a trace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo’s hand flickered as he brought out a treasured blade with a tiger’s head at the hilt.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blade danced furiously as beams of light spurted out, sweeping away all of the afterimages of the whip in an attempt to widen Wang Tuo’s range of movement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his blade carved the way forward, he knew that his attack wouldn’t threaten Wu Chen at all. However, there was hope in him gaining a bit of space of himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As long as the contract beast could leverage Wang Tuo’s aura to distract Wu Chen, then Wang Tuo would have a chance after all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chen smiled coldly as his ears suddenly twitched, as if he’d caught something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His gaze suddenly grew frosty as a sliver of a smile stretched his lips. He shook the whip and suddenly stabbed it into the ground, the whip suddenly as hard and as durable as metal.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Whoosh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The whip seemed to be alive as it sank into the ground with ample spirit power.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Rumble!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>In the next instant, Wu Chen’s arm shook once, and flung his arm viciously upwards. The long whip broke free from the earth like pulling out a daikon root. Chunks of earth flew everywhere as the contract beast was hauled out of the ground</span></p>
 <p><span style>The long whip was wrapped tightly around the contract beast like a trussed up chicken.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The contract beast was whining and growling, fear and panic in its eyes as it kept crying out for Wang Tuo to save it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo and the contract beast had stuck together, and helping each other through many difficulties. They were as close as brothers. And now that he saw the contract beast being tied up, Wang Tuo was enormously shocked. Discarding all thoughts for his own safety, he charged crazily at Wu Chen, raising a blade to chop down on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hmph, one couldn’t do anything to me, and neither can two!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chen’s tone was harsh as a layer of golden radiance suddenly washed over his arm. The radiance instantaneously reached the whip and flashed, a tremendous explosion sounding afterwards.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wham bam!!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The contract beast’s body immediately exploded into shreds like a chunk of crushed tofu, flinging blood and flesh into the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo’s momentum had been exceedingly fast. He was caught up in the gory rain and ended up drenched in the bloody remnants of his contract beast.</span></p>
 <p><span style>There was even a strand of intestines hanging off his neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His eyes almost split apart with their pain amidst this blood and gore. Wang Tuo almost fainted dead away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The contract beast that had followed him for so many years had been made into meat paste with one move and flung all over him!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo had been in the world for so long, and had dominated the four sects—when had he ever come off this worse for the wear in a match?</span></p>
 <p><span style>He ground his teeth and almost sank into insanity, bellowing like a tiger’s roar, “I’m gonna kill you even I die!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo’s treasured blade flashed in the air, as his momentum reached its peak. Like an enraged tiger, he charged forward giving off an aura of laying his life on the line. The blade sliced down a devastatingly powerful frost qi, cutting down at Wu Chen’s neck.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, without the contract beast’s cover, Wang Tuo was like a fierce beast with no claws. He was hardly a bigger threat than Li Yuan at this point.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chen stepped aside as casually as he would when taking a stroll in his backyard. He leaned backwards, out of the way of Wang Tuo’s blow, and lifted his foot. The foot came down directly onto Wang Tuo’s buttocks.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bam!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wang Tuo’s body shot high into the air like a rubber ball.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>No!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Ninelion could no longer bear to watch as his body flickered. He reached out with a hand and grabbed Wang Tuo.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was a good thing that although this kick had been fierce, it hadn’t been fatal. However, it was still enough to confine Wang Tuo to bed for several months.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ninelion had a fiery temper. He glared fiercely at this overweeningly proud young man with his head held high. “So vicious at such a young age?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chen smirked contemptuously. “It wasn’t that I’m vicious, but that they’re too trashy. Do I show mercy to even trash?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He then completely ignored forefather Ninelion and looked in the direction of the Flowing Wind Sect. “Who else?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The head elder on the Flowing Wind Sect who’d been readying to take the field completely lost her will to fight after seeing Li Yuan and Wang Tuo’s defeat.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She knew that it would just be a lesson in self humiliation if she stepped forward. There was no chance of winning at all. With a soft sigh, the elder moved soundlessly behind Venerated Icemist. It was apparent she wasn’t going to fight.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The scene sank into awkwardness &nbsp;again. No one had the guts amongst the three great sects to answer the call. This made the forefathers both infuriated and resigned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chen was so dominating that almost no one in the ninth level spirit realm could fight him. Whoever did so was asking to be humiliated, and was close to courting death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Forefather, now that things have come to this stage, only I can take the field now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Precious Tree Sect head Xie Tianshu smiled ruefully. He knew that it’d be unrealistic for him to look to others to make a move instead of himself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>A gray-clad man behind Wu Chen sneered when Xie Tianshu stepped forward and jumped out himself. “Wu Chen, you can go rest now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>There were two stars embroidered on the newcomer’s chest. His position was obviously higher than Wu Chen’s.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wu Chen chuckled when he saw the other’s move. “Brother Gu, you couldn’t hold back anymore, huh? That’s just as well, this trash is yours!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Tianshu was of the peak of the spirit realm, as was the two star gray-clad man. They were the ones who should face off, logically speaking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Sky Sect second rank inspector envoy Gu Xiong. Challenger, report your name! I do not beat nameless pawns.” This gray-clad man was tall and stocky with firm muscles. Although he wasn’t as childish or biting with his tone as Wu Chen, his words were still filled with pride.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Envoy Gu, this person is Xie Tianshu, head of the Precious Tree Sect.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Spiritual Master Zixu on the Purple Sun Sect side seemed to offer a reminder in a fawning manner.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xiong gaze was arrogant as he surveyed the scene in front of him, his well built body giving him the advantage of one in a superior position. He sized up Xie Tianshu and laughed coldly, “Do the so-called sects only have this little bit of foundation to them? The sect head himself has to take the field? Heh heh, you call yourselves a sect? What an insult to the name! If you come to your senses, you should join the Purple Light Division earlier rather than later. Otherwise, the fact that you dare call yourself a sect is the greatest blasphemy of all, utterly worthy of death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sect head of the Precious Tree Sect was one in which all the attentions and fortunes of the sect were focused on. He wasn’t someone that the vice sect head could measure up to.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sect head’s strength, cultivation level, and equipment were all at the apex of the sect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Tianshu was unassuming before he made a move, but soared to the height of the skies when he finally did. The light from his sword dancing was filled with spirit power, as if a spirit snake on the prowl, attacking with uncanny moves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xiong was firmly rooted in his posture and faced Xie Tianshu with empty hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He punched out with his fists and could actually block Xie Tianshu’s fierce sword qi with that alone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Tianshu’s heart was calm. He knew that he was shouldering an important mission, the like he’d never taken on before. It had to do with the life and death of the sect! Therefore, his every stroke was filled with all of his comprehension of the dao of swords he’d accumulated in his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He actually managed to free himself of the overwhelming pressure in that moment and began to slowly showcase all the meanings behind the sword that he had yet to comprehend.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Tianshu’s sword technique was named the “Tender Rain Sword”. It was as gentle as the spring winds and rain, as if all things on earth were coming back to life, as if spring revisiting the world, as soft as a drizzle of light rain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When the meaning behind the stroke was completely demonstrated, the battle situation became embroiled in the conception of gentle rains drifting through the air.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sword qi acted like strands of silk, permeating every bit of the air with countless numbers of thin rain drops.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xiong was at a disadvantage because he’d been empty handed to behind with, having given the first move advantage to Xie Tianshi. He was actually forced backwards in the face of Xie Tianshu’s display of uncommon skill, limited to just passive defense.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Gu Xiong, can it be that this little bit of meaning behind the sword is enough to make you lose the guts and courage of a cultivator?” Blue-clad Zuo Lan was exceedingly put out by what he saw and not quite shouted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xiong’s body trembled as he seemed to attain some sort of inspiration, some kind of clarity from Zuo Lan’s words.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xiong shook as several strikes in a row connected with him, drenching him in his own blood.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Fantastic!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Precious Tree Sect erupted in a hubbub and cheered when they saw Gu Xiong wounded by the sword qi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Zuo Lan; however, revealed a mocking smile. He knew his provocation had worked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xiong reached out with his tongue and licked off the blood that had sprayed onto his face, his expression becoming even more of a grimace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is the power behind the sword qi of a so-called sect head this mediocre?” A broadsword with a rather ridiculous design appeared in Gu Xiong’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he gripped the sword, Gu Xiong’s presence suddenly increased multiple times. He was like a violent beast awakening from slumber as man and blade became one, his form as if a demon god from ancient times emanating a dominating aura.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eat my blade!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xiong leered, raising his hands up high and brandishing the sword over his head. He seemed to have gathered all the forces across the galaxies for this strike as he cleaved through the air, like a bright wheel of suns ripping through the dark of the night. He split the air with a beam of light. Xie Tianshu’s carefully nurtured atmosphere was completely shattered by this strike.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clang!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Blades collided with each other as the dominating presence of the sword qi actually increased by three, four times and hurtled towards Xie Tianshu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ah!!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xie Tianshu’s chest felt muffled as the sword qi invaded his body.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pfft!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He spat out fresh blood and tumbled from the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Gu Xiong had been hemmed in by Xie Tianshu’s sword qi a moment ago, but a mysterious power seemed to have awakened in him. The momentum of his blade burst forth spontaneously as it crashed forcefully and suppressed the meaning behind Xie Tianshu’s sword. With one move, Gu Xiong had broken apart Xie Tianshu’s defenses and wounded him!</span></p>
