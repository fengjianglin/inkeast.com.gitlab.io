 <p><span style>Chapter 403: The Duel Between Fated Rivals</span></p>
 <p><span style>The semifinals were over, and two days were once again allotted for the finalists to rest and adjust themselves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Emotions had to be carefully brewed before a faceoff between experts in this pinnacle match.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen didn’t waste the two days. Although he hadn’t used the Lotus in his match against Lei Gangyang, he’d comprehended theories he’d never had before in that stroke.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The blow had represented the highest level of power that he was so far able to bring forth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It had cleaved through the obstacles of Jiang Chen’s martial knowledge and heralded him into a new arena.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had forced new changes and the mentality of unexpected changes in a strike that held sure death.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He’d had a faint comprehension in that moment of life and death, and that understanding had given him a strong premonition that he was about to obtain a completely new breakthrough on his path of martial dao.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, the mindset of that blow had enabled him to subtly touch the door to the sky spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The earth spirit realm, the sky spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although they were but one step away from each other, there was the distance of heaven and earth between them.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The meaning behind that stroke meant that Jiang Chen had comprehended life and death, the heavens and earth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Boundless martial dao inspiration poured forth once again like carp bounding upstream, giving him the emotion of spontaneous joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if endless doors were opening to him, presenting all sorts of new scenes in front of Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed, there is a bridge between the heavens and earth. This bridge encompasses all living beings, and controls life and death. The sky spirit realm, the sky spirit realm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Many thoughts surfaced in Jiang Chen’s mind at this moment. They gathered together until they formed three radiant, golden words—sky spirit realm.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Indeed, that catalyst that would set everything in motion had finally arrived.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Since refining the Fire Raven King’s core, the accumulation of Jiang Chen’s spirit ocean had reached quite an abundant level and was waiting for the moment to emerge from its cocoon.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wham!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>It was as if Jiang Chen’s spirit ocean suddenly broke free of its entrappings and danced through the air like a colorful butterfly. His spirit ocean suddenly expanded by five times, akin to the earth giving birth to the heavens, the vast oceans transforming to mulberry fields, and the stars forming the universe…</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen once again had the feeling of touching the heavenly law in this moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The sky spirit realm, I’ve been waiting for you.” Jiang Chen smiled faintly, a smile full of wisdom. He seemed like a heavenly emperor who held all in his grasp in this moment, full of confidence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As his clear eyes opened and closed, they sparkled with stunning glamor, the light of water and fire, the light of metal, and the light of thunder and lightning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In that instant, all of the attributes beneath the heavens continuously arose in Jiang Chen’s body as if in a cycle of reincarnation. He seemed to be creating a small world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was indeed the case, as each cultivator’s spirit ocean was a small world, and the cultivator the master of this world.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen thoroughly immersed himself in the atmosphere of breaking through to the sky spirit realm. He was slowly absorbing the changes, digesting them, and was as comfortable as a dragon frolicking in the waves and surges of the ocean.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He spent the two days completely submerged within this change, completely different from Long Juxue and her enormous racket that had alarmed the sky quadrant and shown off her glory.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In stark contrast, Jiang Chen was the epitome of keeping a low profile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long Juxue… you escaped with your life thanks to a fluke in the battle of the Second Crossing. Let’s see how you escape this time!” A cold light swept through Jiang Chen’s God’s Eye after his breakthrough.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He had absolute confidence that he would trounce Long Juxue in this match!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Breaking through to the sky spirit realm had made his strength and battle strength suddenly surge forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he was at the sixth level realm, his chances of killing Long Juxue was around seventy percent.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Now that he was also at the seventh level spirit realm, he had absolute confidence. What he was considering now was how to suddenly execute a lethal blow so that even Sunchaser would be unable to interfere.</span></p>
 <p><span style>These two days were truly an agony for those waiting for the final match with bated breath.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Although the outside world almost all favored Long Juxue, the match had yet to begin and so there was always a hint of suspense. Who could say that Jiang Chen didn’t have another trump card up his sleeve?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Up until now, the feeling that he gave others was an unfathomable one.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the Precious Tree Sect side, almost all were on Jiang Chen’s side apart from the Iron family. They had a sort of anticipation in their hearts, hoping that Jiang Chen would trample Long Juxue and take the championship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Precious Tree Sect needed a genius like this.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was because the situation of the Purple Sun Sect’s dominance had lasted for far, far too long in the sixteen kingdom alliance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Forefather Sunchaser himself was giving a speech on the Purple Sun Sect side.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You cannot underestimate this fellow. Xue’er, I cannot see through his potential. He’s destined to be your rival. If you can overcome this obstacle, then your future will be without limit. If you are unable to do so, then all your potential is as fleeting as the cloud and winds.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser’s tone was as stern as it’d ever been.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue nodded her head solemnly. “Be at peace forefather, I won’t underestimate my enemy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Sunchaser nodded and didn’t say much more. He knew that whatever he said now, even if he repeated it a thousand times, was hollow.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only the strongest would prevail!</span></p>
 <p><span style>This match would determine who was at the peak of the sixteen kingdoms. The path of a genius could not be blocked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…….</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the enormous ring.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The last stage of the selection and the last match was finally about to commence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>No one would’ve thought that those standing at the apex of the younger generation of the sixteen kingdoms would be two from the secular world, and both from that little place called the Eastern Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>It was quite ironic that all the direct descendants of the four great sects had been stomped underfoot by two ordinary cultivators.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue stood in a flowing white dress, her face cold and her presence as radiant as the sun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, I admit that you’re an undefeatable cockroach with an incredible will to live. You must be so proud of your little self to have climbed up, step by step from the secular world. You think you finally have the chance to challenge me, don’t you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue’s tone was remote as her elegant brow arched delicately. An immense sense of superiority suffused her words and tone, and she didn’t bother concealing her dismissal of Jiang Chen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I will use the truth today to tell you that your hard earned gains have only gained you the opportunity to be tortured to death by me. You, are just a secular ant at the end of the day, and I am a phoenix soaring the nine heavens. The difference between us is that of heaven and dearth. I will utterly trample you into the dust in this match, giving you no opportunity to come back for all eternity!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue’s hatred of Jiang Chen had long surpassed the feud of a father and brother’s death. She didn’t hate that he had killed her family, but that he had displayed complete disregard of her since the Eastern Kingdom.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue had enjoyed being the center of attention no matter where she went starting when she was young. She’d always been coveted after and praised to the skies, enjoying the treatment of one on high.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only from Jiang Chen had she never felt this satisfaction of being well above all.</span></p>
 <p><span style>And then after she’d entered the sect, Jiang Chen had once again challenged her mental state again and again, continuously capering in front of her like a cockroach. This was completely unforgivable to Long Juxue. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen smiled. This smile was like the sun radiating over the land and instantly melting Long Juxue’s frozen thrall over things.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Long Juxue, I’ve said this before. You lost to me in the secular world and you will be unable to escape this fate today. So what if you’ve an innate constitution? So what if you’ve received the fortunes of the Purple Sun Sect on yourself? You spoke correctly. The difference between you and I are indeed like the heavens and earth, only you are that toad on the earth and will never know how tall the skies are. Don’t talk of the heavens and this world in front of me, no one understands the heavens more than I do!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had quite a heroic demeanor about himself as his awe inspiring manner soared to the skies.</span></p>
 <p><span style>What was this talk of the heavens in front of him?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Who understood them more than the son of the Celestial Emperor? Long Juxue? The four great sects? They were just a few ants in some small corner on an inconsequential plane!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“There is no point in further talk. Long Juxue, I’ll send you to meet with Long Zhaofeng and Long Yinye in this match!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen brought forth the nameless saber and pointed with it, an unparalleled momentum behind him as he waved it in a slash.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This slash was like the stroke that had broken through Lei Gangyang, untraceable as if an immortal from the heavens.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue snorted coldly, “Repeating that same old trick?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her fingers formed a seal like a lotus as the motions formed a conduit. She shouted lowly, “Azure Phoenix Freezing Qi, Crystal Wall!”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Hum.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A wall of ice that shimmered in and out of existence formed in front of Long Juxue, blocking all of the momentum from Jiang Chen’s blade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The freezing qi had formed a ice wall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This method could rather put a stop to all attacks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The freezing qi crept amongst the wall like frost. Layers of frigid frost formed around the entire ring, turning it into a misty white world like an avalanche sealing off the mountain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, meet your death!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue sang out softly as her slender arms waved, a short sword magically appearing in her hand. When this short sword appeared, it was as radiant as lunar splendor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The enormous spirit power ripples indicated that it was also a nine times refined spirit weapon.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue’s figure was charming, as if an azure phoenix dancing gracefully in the heavy snow. Her aura soared to the nine heavens and morphed into the shadow of an azure phoenix. The short sword in her hand transformed into a frosty beam of light and shot forward with violent speed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The entire ring had become enchanted into Long Juxue’s environment of a thousand li of ice.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Jiang Chen, go turn into an ice sculpture!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Frigid light cascaded downwards like a waterfall as Jiang Chen’s body suddenly halted, becoming enclosed by the icy light. Frost instantly crept over him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In barely the span of breath, the white frost had completely enclosed this figure and an ice sculpture had formed before too long.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue laughed softly and used the short sword in hand to draw back and forth on the sculpture, seeming to want to carve him into the image of a clown.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden development of this scene caused exclamations of shock to emit from the audience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This had been simply too quick?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen had been turned into an ice sculpture by one of Long Juxue’s moves?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue’s strength was simply too frightening!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Everyone had had some expectations for Jiang Chen thanks to his perverse abilities, but their anticipation had been utterly smashed in a single moment.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If even Jiang Chen was unable to challenge Long Juxue, then who could?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Long Juxue stood high and proud, the short sword flying in her hands and shaving away countless flecks of ice like it were an axe.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Long Juxue’s gaze froze as her lithe figure halted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because, she’d discovered that as the outside layers of ice were stripped back, the sculpture was empty inside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jiang Chen wasn’t inside the block of ice!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He seemed to have vanished into thin air!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, the hairs on Long Juxue’s body stood on end as a prickly feeling of horror ran down all over her.</span></p>
