 <p>Soon, he raised his hand, edging towards Ji Yunshu. Her cheeks reddened upon contact with his fingertips! She felt a shiver run down her spine. Her head turned away as her eyes shifted downwards.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jing Rong chuckled, “Why are nervous? I’m not going to eat you.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not nervous.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Yunshu.” He called her.</p>
 <p><em>Mm</em>? She raised her eyes.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jing Rong stared at her curiously and probed, “I don’t know how many more surprises will you bring for me.”&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>Hm?</em> She was in a daze.</p>
 <p>Jing Rong lifted her pale fingers on her hand. “I thought you would only use these hands to paint and examine corpses. I didn’t expect you would have a clever and eloquent tongue. Even that Mingshan Academy scholar was dumbstruck by your words. “</p>
 <p><em>So, it was this!</em> She pursed her lips and modestly remarked, “It was from my readings. I just said some words, and somehow, it was able to fool them.”</p>
 <p>“You didn’t only fool them, but this prince as well. Moreover, I want to be fooled by you for life.” These affectionate words, like the gentle wind, flew into her ear bit by bit. She felt warmth flush through her cheeks!</p>
 <p>While Ji Yunshu tried to make sense of her heart, she was pulled into his strong embrace. The two silhouettes hid under the veranda, facing toward the soft moonlight. Dusky light fell on them, illuminating them as if they were in an old-fashioned poster! &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Ji Yunshu’s face laid on his warm chest, enjoying this gentle moment that belonged to them. She had to admit that under this embrace, would she let go of her precautions and relish a woman’s happiness. She had to admit that she was immeasurably greedy, wanting to forever remain in this warm embrace.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>A while later, she raised her head and gaze at him. “Are you really going to leave Miss Tang here?”</p>
 <p><em>Pop!</em> These words caused the&nbsp;picturesque scene to fall apart.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Jing Rong grabbed her chin. “Has the famous Teacher Ji fallen in love with Miss Tang?”</p>
 <p>“What are you blabbering on about?” She turned her head and pushed him away. “I just worry that she can’t do this alone. If she made a mess of things, we may not be able to put it back together.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t worry. Isn’t there still Mo Ruo? He will look after her, after all, he owes Miss Tang a life.”</p>
 <p>“He’ll help her?”</p>
 <p>“Of course.” Jing Ring was certain.</p>
 <p><em>Mo Ruo will help Tang Si? Really? If so, then it will be a good show!</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“It's getting late. Rest early. We have to get going tomorrow.” Ji Yunshu bade.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“But I want to stay with you. How about tonight…” Jing Rong offered.</p>
 <p>“Impossible!” She vetoed.</p>
 <p>Jing Rong smirked, “Did you already know what I’m going to say even though I haven’t finished speaking?”</p>
 <p>Jing Rong smiled mischievously at her stuttering. He lowered his head and gave her a light kiss on her forehead. “I won’t mess with you. Rest early.” Then, he departed in ease. Behind, Ji Yunshu revealed a smile. She prepared to head to her room, but Shang Zhuo arrived.</p>
 <p>“Teacher Ji.” Shang Zhuo called out, walking towards her with large strides. The ink splotch on his plain robe was extremely eye-catching.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>“Master Shang? Is there something I can help you with?”&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shang Zuo gave a bow in respect. “I hope Teacher Ji doesn’t take offence at what happened then. Lin Shu has always been this way, and his words had offended you. Please don’t take it personally.”</p>
 <p><em>So, it was for this matter!&nbsp;</em>She replied, “Why would I? It was my fault. If I did not agree to compete with him in painting, all of this would not have happened. We are only lodging here for the night as guests. There was no reason to clash and cause your academy to be in this mess and hurt Master Lin. It was not intended. I will have to trouble Master Shang to apologize to Master Lin on our behalf.” She bowed her head!</p>
 <p>Shang Zhuo didn’t expect this! He took out that painting and murmured, “Teacher Ji, I stealthily stored it away to keep it from ruin. Please don’t take offence, teacher.”</p>
 <p>“This… …”</p>
 <p>“Teacher, this painting makes people exclaim in admiration!” <em>What exclamation of admiration! This is obviously below average!</em> She smiled wordlessly.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Shang Zhuo possessed the ability to surprise people, insight, and naturally would set him apart from others. He informed, “This painting looks inferior to Lin Shu’s painting which is slightly better. But I believe Teacher yield to him. Anyways, winning is easy, but to lose quietly is extremely hard. Teacher perhaps did not want Lin Shu to continuously nag and lost on purpose. As for Teacher’s painting, although it appears to be formless lines, there is grace within. Although the painting style seems loose, there is energy and discipline in the brushstrokes. Every brush is measured in depth and ends with restraint. Though it does not exude the aggressiveness of the painting ‘Jiangbei Huaibei’, there remains an aura of death and ruthlessness of the battlefield. Although it does not have the despair of ‘Jiangbei Huainan’, it expresses the helplessness and grief of people who lost everything during war. Death and the dead, pain and the injured, it is full of grief.”</p>
 <p><em>This evaluation is certainly professional!&nbsp;</em>She had to admit he was an intelligent person. His words detailed clearly both Ji Yunshu’s thoughts and her painting skills. Naturally, there was no further need to conceal anything else. &nbsp;“Teacher Yu said that your painting is exceptional, especially that piece, ’Peace Under a Wise Ruler’. It is more authentic and lifelike than Ouyang Ye’s. This one can conceal it from others but cannot hide it from you. Since you’re not with anyone, I’ll be straightforward. Otherwise, Master Lin will not let this go. Regardless of what I say, it is proper that Master Lin wins. There is no need to be too particular, Master Shang. Am I correct?”</p>
 <p>“Teacher is correct.” He continued, “Indeed, who wins or loses is unimportant. But this painting, would teacher gift it to me?”</p>
 <p><em>It’s not a masterpiece, what need is there to collect it?</em> “Of course.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Teacher.” He bowed in return. “Then… … I will not bother Teacher’s rest.”</p>
 <p>“Mm.” Shang Zhou left. Ji Yunshu returned to her room. Finally, her ears were blessed with silence.&nbsp;</p>
 <p><em>On the other side, at the hot spring behind the mountain.&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Crowds of students covered in ink came here to bathe. Under the moonlight, they all bared their shoulders, covered their lower parts with a towel, and dived into the pool as they wished. Within a moment, the pool of hot spring became inky black.&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Lin Shu reclined indolently in the water as if he were overseeing the entire pool. Both of his hands were on top of the warming rock, while the whip-lashes on his shoulder still oozed blood. On his sides were two fellow students applying medicine. The liquid medicine seeped into his skin and flesh. He winced in pain and cried, “Softly, it hurts.”&nbsp;</p>
