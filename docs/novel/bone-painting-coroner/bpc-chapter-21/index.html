 <p><span style>The two soon arrived at Miss Zhou’s courtyard, one following the other. There was no one guarding the place apart from the lantern placed in the corner, causing the courtyard to be shrouded in an eerie atmosphere!</span><i><span style>Creeeak~</span></i><span style>A sound came from the bedroom! Then, a flicker of a candlelight in the window, revealing the vague silhouette of someone moving around.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu and Jing Rong looked at each other and loudly pushed the door before proceeding inside. The mysterious person suddenly turned around and dropped the handkerchief in her hand in fright. Her body trembled as she stared at them in shock.</span></p>
 <p><span style>They could only see the thin outline of the woman’s figure. Skin stretched tight over bone, her shoulders didn’t seem to have any strength at all. She didn’t appear angry, just deathly pale. She looked around 16 or 17 years old, but how could she look so sickly?</span><span style>“Are you… Suyun?” Ji Yunshu’s intuition sparked.</span><span style>The young girl displayed an empty expression as she woodenly nodded.</span><span style>“Why are you here?”</span><span style>Suyun shook. In fact, her whole body quaked from fear. She lowered her head and whispered, “Miss said she didn’t like the room to be dark. I just wanted to light the candle for her, so I came to her room to light it.”</span><span style>Indeed, she had lit the crystal sculpted candlestick!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu nodded and no longer showed any interest. She introduced herself instead.</span><span style>“Miss Suyun, my surname is Ji, and my purpose here is to investigate the cause of your miss’ death.”</span><span style>“I know. Qiaoxin already told me.” Suyun’s manner of speaking lacked any energy.</span><span style>“That’s good then.”</span><span style>While she spoke, Ji Yunshu was looking at Suyun’s dropped handkerchief on the floor. Then, she stepped forward to pick it up.</span><span style>There were two beautiful blooming mulberry flowers embroidered on the white handkerchief: one red, the other blue. The red blossom had a corner where the thread had been severed.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu frowned. “The flowers are quite lovely. Did you embroider them yourself?”</span><span style>“Yes.”</span><span style>“You have a skillful pair of hands.”</span><span style>“T-thank you.”</span><span style>“Come here. Keep it properly, so you don’t drop it again. It won’t be pretty anymore if you dirty it.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu returned the handkerchief to Suyun. When Suyun’s lanky fingers came in contact with Ji Yunshu’s hand, she grabbed onto the handkerchief and immediately took it back. From the beginning to the end, she didn’t dare to lift her head, going so far as to lower it even more.</span><span style>“Then I won’t disturb Teacher working.” Suyun curtsied, making for the door.</span><span style>But Ji Yunshu deftly stretched her leg and tripped her. Suyun stumbled and directly fell forwards. Fortunately, Jing Rong was behind her and managed to catch her in time.</span><i><span style>‘Oh! The hero coming to the rescue of the beauty!’</span></i><span style>Jing Rong released her only after she regained her balance. After that, he retreated a few steps before sending a ferocious glare at Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>Suyun covered her chest in panic. She raised her eyes and looked at Jing Rong.</span><span style>“Thank you very much, young master.”</span><span style>Jing Rong didn’t reply.</span><span style>Suyun bit her lips until they discolored, and hurriedly left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s complexion turned dark from anger. He questioned Ji Yunshu in a harsh tone, “Preposterous! Even if you wanted to send a woman to me, did it cross your mind to take my opinion into consideration?”</span><span style>However, Ji Yunshu didn’t object. “I don’t understand what your Highness is talking about.”</span><span style>“This prince clearly saw that you deliberately tripped her.”</span><span style>“Yes, I did trip her on purpose. So what?” Ji Yunshu played down her words, her tone neither light nor heavy. However, it contained hidden meaning!</span><span style>Jing Rong failed to understand, and was about to question her further when Ji Yunshu turned her attention to searching the room.</span><span style>“What are you searching for?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu, who was meticulously combing through the room, threw out a reply, “Something that could scare those maidservants.”</span><span style>“Something that they are afraid of?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t spare the time to resolve his doubts since she was busy searching the room. Finally, she found what she was looking for on the deceased Miss Zhou’s bed.</span><span style>It was wrapped within layer upon layer of beddings, making it impossible to guess the object inside. Ji Yunshu reached for the beddings and unwrapped the layers in an orderly manner until the item, a small and exquisite box nestled inside, was revealed.</span><span style>She held the box in her cupped hand and opened it. When the thing inside was reflected in her eyes, all the previous doubts in her heart completely vanished!</span><span style>She closed the box. Her expression was grave as she turned and walked back to Jing Rong.</span><span style>“Prince, when tomorrow comes, we will solve this case.”</span><span style>Her words caused Jing Rong to grow even more puzzled.</span></p>
