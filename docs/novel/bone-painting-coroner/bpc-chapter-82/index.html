 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong, true to his words, gave yet another piece of silver to the boatman, which caused the latter to grin and bow down several times. As he did so, he kept on repeating to them to “have a pleasant day.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The village was deserted due to heavy rain, and the occasional passer-by would be running as quickly as they could to get to their destination as soon as possible. Although Jing Rong and Ji Yunshu had umbrellas, they did little to prevent their coats and footwears from being drenched. Soon enough, a biting cold climbed from their feet into the rest of their body.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The two stopped at the doorstep of a derelict straw house. Ji Yunshu knocked at the door, and it took a long while before the shabby door was opened with a loud creak. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A hoary old woman with a hunched back appeared and looked at both Ji Yunshu and Jing Rong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You are?” </span><span style>“Excuse me, old madame, may I ask where can I find Yu Sao?” Ji Yunshu &nbsp;asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, you mean Ah’Yu?” The woman said as she pointed in a particular direction, “Follow that path and walk around the forest. You’ll find a wooden hut there. That’s Ah’Yu’s home.”</span><i><span style>‘She lives in the forest?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you, old madame.” Ji Yunshu said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman looked at her with a affectionate smile and said, “You two aren’t from here, are you? Are you related to Ah’Yu?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, you could say so,” answered Ji Yunshu, her composure unbroken by the blatant lie. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman gave a slight nod, sighed and said, “Ah’Yu has had a hard life with many difficulties. Her husband passed away early and it’s been hard for her ever since, especially in the last few years. If you can help out, you should.” </span><span style>The sympathy the old woman showed was simple, but yet thought-provoking precisely because of its simplicity. Ji Yunshu assented and left her some silver before leaving. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong was silent the whole time, properly fulfilling the role of a servant accompanying his master. The two walked in the rain next to each other, and their figures, one tall and the other short, composed quite the picturesque scene under the paper umbrella. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong turned his eyes and asked without thinking. “Weren’t you here for your father’s funeral procession?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“......” </span><i><span style>‘Hey, how did you jump to this topic, and did you really need to ask that?’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu really would have liked to stuff something into Jing Rong’s mouth to prevent him from talking any further. However, since that was evidently impossible, instead, she pretended that the noise from the rain had muffled Jing Rong’s question. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The two of them arrived to a place where the trees began to thicken. However, it resembled smoldering ruins more than a lush forest. The few trees which had been planted were uprooted by the heavy rain and winds. The road that meandered through them was an unpaved muddy path, with many unpleasant surprises for the traveller who chooses to set foot upon it. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Even the poorest of people wouldn’t want to live in such a desolate and remote place, wouldn’t they?’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu thought. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu looked at Jing Rong and said, “Milord, high-grade silk which is mired can never recover its beauty. May I suggest you to wait for me here?”</span><span style>“Swallow these words of yours, I don’t want to hear them.” Jing Rong said without a single change in his expression. </span><span style>“But…” </span><span style>“Aren’t you here to investigate? We could already be in there by now if weren’t for your meaningless proposition.” </span><i><span style>“Oh, really, shame on me I guess,” </span></i><span style>thought Ji Yunshu. </span><span style>Jing Rong lifted his robe and led the way into the squalid track filled with yellow dirt and pebbles. His imposing figure slowly vanished into the shadow of the woods. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu followed him, stepping on Jing Rong’s large footprints, it seemed like it wasn’t as slippery as she would have imagined. </span><span style>The pathway opened up after a while, and Ji Yunshu saw a derelict dwelling on the verge of crumbling under the heavy rain. To call it a shack would be an euphemism. Knick-knacks outside of the house, scattered by the wind gusts and covered in filth, completed the desolate picture. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there really someone living here?” uttered Jing Rong. </span><span style>“Let’s go have a look inside,” suggested Ji Yunshu. She walked towards the entrance, but turned back after two steps to slip an advice to Jing Rong, “Milord, we are here to visit relatives, but they’ve moved away without telling us. Since we are without a place to rest, we came here to ask some water and a place to stay momentarily.”</span><span style>“What?” said Jing Rong with eyes wide in amazement. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Milord, please remember what this humble one said.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu did not explain any further and approached the doorstep. The door, if it could be called one, was no more than a layer of wooden planks disorderly nailed to the frame. The occasional slit between two planks revealed a glimpse of the interior, which was dimly lit by the dwindling light of a single oil lamp. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu curled her fingers and knocked on the door. She waited for a while, but no one came to answer her. </span><span style>Jing Rong was rather irritated. “Move aside, this door is not solid enough to withstand a hard kick.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘You should go kick yourself in the head! Can we avoid getting into the habit of resorting to violence?’</span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu glared at him, “Have you thought about what’ll happen to these poor people after you break their door? Do you want them to freeze to death in the winter? On top of that…” Ji Yunshu was about to continue lecturing him when the door suddenly flung open. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>A pair of eyes, aged by the vicissitudes of life and buried within disordered hair, were the first things that the two saw. Ji Yunshu and Jing Rong only realized that they belonged to a woman after they saw her face in its entirety. The facial muscles were flaccid, and wrinkles ran, interwoven on the skin. Time and age conferred a natural air of askance to the owner of that visage. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who are you?” said the woman with a weak voice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu answered in a soft voice, “Madame, sorry to disturb you. My brother and I are here to visit relatives, but they moved away without telling us, so we don’t have a place to stay for now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>We’d like to know if it’s possible to have a brief respite in your house, and have some water to drink.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu’s soft voice and charismatic looks probably convinced the woman that they meant no harm. She scrutinized the duo, finally opened the half-closed door and said, “Come in,” as she turned around and led the way. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu and Jing Rong glanced at each other before following her into the dwelling. The inside was poorly lit and narrow between the walls, but surprisingly clean. Although the furniture pieces were worn out, the table and chairs were neatly placed and covered with a clean towel, which improved its look. Further inside was the entrance to a room, hidden by a curtain which replaced the door that should have been there. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu and Jing Rong sat near the table. The latter sat with a straight back and did not seem to be repulsed by his surroundings. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Seems like this prince is not spoilt after all’, </span></i><span style>thought Ji Yunshu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The woman brought two bowls of water and said, “Please take your time sir, if you’d like more, I’ll gladly refill it.” </span><span style>“Thank you madame,” answered Jing Rong politely. </span><span style>He emptied the water in the porcelain vessel cleanly. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Well, he’s really thirsty isn’t he?’ </span></i><span style>“Madame, are you the only person living here?” attempted Ji Yunshu. </span><span style>“Yes, I live alone.”</span><i><span style>‘Shouldn’t she have a daughter?’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu was perplexed. “How long have you lived here?”</span><span style>“For a few years,” answered the woman in an indecipherable voice, emotionlessly. </span><span style>“May I know your name?” asked Ji Yunshu. </span><span style>The woman suddenly raised her head to look at Ji Yunshu, only to dodge the latter’s stare, and answered, “Everyone here calls me Yu Sao.”</span><i><span style>‘Seems like she’s the one I’m looking for. Only, what happened to her eight year old daughter?’ </span></i></p>
