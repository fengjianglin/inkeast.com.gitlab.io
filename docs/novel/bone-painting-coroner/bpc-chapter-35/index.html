 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu had really underestimated Jing Rong. She would have never imagined that his martial arts was this outstanding.</span><span style>While he fought, she spared no effort to drag Fu Bo to the side.</span><span style>It was better to watch from the sidelines!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong fought with his bare hands, engaging all of the men in black in a heated battle. His tall and stalwart body was deadly, and he didn’t lose out in agility.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After he dodged the swords, he forcefully yanked away a sword from one of the mysterious attackers. But instead of using the sword to protect himself, he immediately counterattacked by killing every enemy that dove into reach, which was completely out of Ji Yunshu’s expectations!</span><span style>His usually noble and lofty appearance felt like it was ripped apart, revealing underneath a vividly vicious, stern and somber entity.</span><span style>The sword danced in his hand, claiming lives and causing mortal wounds. Three of the black-clothed men were already lying in a pool of blood. </span><span style>The scene of the swords clashing and flashing under the candlelights dazzled the eyes.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu felt her mind tense up. Her hands were still tightly grabbing Fu Bo and dragging him away from the fight. The safe and secure place where she’d stood earlier seemed like it had been hit by a storm.</span><span style>Right at that moment, one of the black-clothed men noticed Ji Yunshu squatting in a corner. He switched targets, thrusting a blade straight at Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>When the sword edge neared her, her eyes widened twofold in shock.</span><span style>She was in the prime of her youth, and yet she was going to die in such a way. Wasn’t it sad? In that single instant, many things flashed through her mind.</span><span style>For example, the money that she’d hidden under her bed which Luan’er had no knowledge of; the set of calligraphy brushes and inkstone from the Treasured Calligraphy house that she hadn’t used yet; the money for the insoles that she still owed Great Aunt Li who lived on Beixie street!</span><span style>Ah! She also forgot to tell the people in Ji Mansion that when she’d be buried, she didn’t want to be buried underneath a sandalwood tree. The smell was very strong and she wouldn’t be able to rest in peace. She wanted to be buried under a pine tree!</span><span style>..........</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Her chaotic thoughts lasted a fleeting moment. Because in reality, the sword had yet to pierce her. It was only a few centimeters away from her. She was about to be stabbed!</span><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Merciful Buddha! Heavens, protect me!’</span></i><i><span style>‘JING RONG!’ </span></i><span style>If that deity could save her, she would make a mud-clay statue and pray to him.</span><span style>When Jing Rong saw that the sword was about to pierce Ji Yunshu, his hand accelerated. His sword cleaved the air, cutting right through the black-clothed man’s neck just in time!</span><span style>Blood spurted out and basted Jing Rong’s clean clothes in red, along with Ji Yunshu fair and tender face!</span><span style>The remaining three men knew that they’d lost the battle. One of them took the lead and yelled, “Retreat!” They swiftly dodged Jing Rong’s sword and jumped onto the roof, escaping into the night.</span><span style>Do not chase after a cornered enemy.</span><span style>Jing Rong’s dark and icy gaze were fixed on the place they’d disappeared.</span><span style>When he turned around, he saw Ji Yunshu’s bloody face. Her face revealed an expression of intense worry. He quickly went in front of Ji Yunshu and grabbed her slender arm. He inquired, “Are you alright? Did you get hurt?”</span><span style>She shook her head. But she appeared particularly haggard! She used her sleeve to clean the blood off her face. After that, she looked dully at Jing Rong and said, “Your Highness has killed people. Can you go a bit farther? If their blood was poisoned, I’d already be dead.”</span><span style>“You still have the leisure of saying such things at this time?” Jing Rong’s expression was thunderous.</span><span style>“This humble one is being serious.” Her eyes glinted as she tried to explain that she wasn’t joking.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong helplessly distanced himself from her and went over to Fu Bo. He stretched his hand under Fu Bo’s nose, checking to see if he was still breathing. However, to Jing Rong’s surprise, Ji Yunshu hit his hand away. “Fu Bo is not dead yet.”</span><span style>“I only wanted to confirm. What are you getting all excited for?”</span><span style>That was true. She was acting quite emotional and making a fuss over nothing. It must be due to the lingering fear from the near-death experience. </span><span style>“Fu Bo must have fainted from fright. Please lend me a hand in bringing him back into the hall.”</span><span style>Jing Rong grunted and lifted Fu Bo all by himself. Ji Yunshu wanted to help but was rejected by Jing Rong. He lightly spoke, “Go wash your face.”</span><span style>It came out like an order, but it was possible to sense the awkwardness in his voice.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu nodded. She had yet to tell him where the medicine was, but Jing Rong had already carried Fu Bo inside.</span><span style>Then she looked at the five corpse littering the ground. She didn’t know whether she should be happy or worried.</span><span style>She still needed to take the corpses and burn them. She really shouldn’t have gone out tonight. </span><span style>After washing her face, she was about to go see Fu Bo when Jing Rong came out with a serious expression. “Fu Bo is resting. Don’t go in and disturb his rest.”</span><span style>“The wound…”</span><span style>“I’ve already bandaged it.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu nodded, then looked at him before showing her gratitude, “Your Highness, thank you very much for earlier.”</span><span style>“No need to thank me. Saving a life is like building a seven-floor pagoda. Besides, my case is still unresolved. If you die now, who can this prince find to replace you in such a short time?” Jing Rong’s stubborn temper was stimulated.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu was used to his temper, but still glanced at him in gratitude.</span><span style>But then, from the ground, one of the men in black rose without anyone noticing and used the last of his strength to lift his sword and slash at the nearest person, Ji Yunshu. Her back toward him, she completely failed to sense the danger.</span><span style>“Be careful!”</span><span style>Jing Rong was caught off guard. He reflexively pulled Ji Yunshu into his embrace and faced the attacker. Caught without any time to think, he could only raise his arm to shield Ji Yunshu from the sword. The sword slashed into his arm, creating a long gash.</span><span style>There was no time to think about his wound. He used his leg to scoop up a sword on the ground and kicked it with all his strength. The sword flew like a flash of lightning and embedded itself deeply into the man’s chest.</span><span style>He dropped to the ground, instantly dead!</span><span style>At this moment, Ji Yunshu was safe and sound in Jing Rong’s arms. Their bodies were so close to each other that she could smell the inherent scent of a man hovering at the tips of her nose, causing her to heat up.</span><span style>She raised her eyes and cautiously peeped at Jing Rong. Her gaze traveled from his jaw to his long thick eyelashes, lightly trembling with each blink. He was extremely good-looking! Now both his hands were monopolizing her waist. It was unclear how much strength was concealed in those hands. At this instant, her heart skipped a beat! </span></p>
 <p><span style>When she recovered her spirit, she retreated back a few steps and lowered her eyes. This time, it took her a lot of effort to calm her heart. After that, she raised her eyes and looked at Jing Rong’s unsteady posture. His expression was weak and his lips had gone pale.</span><span style>“Prince, how’s your body?” She stepped forward to support him. Then, she discovered the wound on his arm, startling her. “You’re injured?”</span><span style>“This Prince is fine.” Jing Rong stubbornly tried to support himself as he incessantly blabbered, “This is just a little injury, nothing to make a mountain out of. When I was on the battlefield, you weren’t even born yet.”</span><i><span style>‘Hey! Your logic makes no sense! What you once did is none of my business.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t bother arguing with him. She looked at the wound on his arm. Blood was flowing out from the wound, but wasn’t blood supposed to be red? Why was it black?</span><span style>“Your Highness! That sword is poisoned.” Ji Yunshu became angry at Jing Rong.</span><span style>Then, it must’ve meant that Fu Bo didn’t faint, but was poisoned by the sword cut!</span><span style>As soon as her words left her lips, Jing Rong’s body slumped down on Ji Yunshu. Her small shoulder trembled. How could she support such a heavy body by herself?!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their bodies were now stuck extremely close together. Jing Rong’s head rested on Ji Yunshu’s shoulder. His nose was letting out warm breaths on her neck, tingling and tickling her skin.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The sensation made her whole body shiver from head to toe. This was the first time in her life that she’d hugged and been hugged by the same man several times.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s mouth slightly parted. In a daze, he whispered into her ear, </span><span style>“This prince… i-is fine.”</span></p>
