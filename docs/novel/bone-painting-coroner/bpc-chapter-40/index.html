 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The night was bitterly cold, and despite the fact that the snow had stopped falling, the frigid wind still whistled in the air. The biting cold seeped into the body like a worm, making the body burn in pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Yi was covered in a thick, light blue outer garment. His neck was wrapped with a gray scarf. He was in a daze, seriously pondering something as he walked in a circle, leaving traces of his pacing in the snow. Sometimes, he would stay still while letting out white puffs of breath, lost in thought. All in all, it was an extremely cute sight! And at other times, he would sneak frequent side glances at the Ji Mansion’s entrance.</span><span style>He must have waited for at least two hours. His fair skin had turned red from the biting cold.</span><span style>From a distance, Ji Yunshu saw him hiding behind the stone lion near the entrance. His head kept peeking out from his hiding place.</span><i><span style>‘What is that cute little fool doing here?’ </span></i><span style>Could it be that he was itching to find Ji Yunshu for another scare session? </span><span style>Since she was curious about the reason he came, Ji Yunshu approached him.</span><span style>“Wei Yi, why are you here?”</span><span style>Wei Yi got scared when a voice suddenly popped up behind him. It scared him to the point that he almost jumped up!</span><span style>He turned around and saw an unfamiliar “man”.</span><span style>“You scared me.” He muttered in a small voice. His innocent face kept changing expressions, and his hands were on his chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His appearance made Ji Yunshu want to laugh. “Who scared you? If you didn’t feel as guilty as a thief, how can you be scared?”</span><span style>But Wei Yi shook his head in panic and hastily denied it. “I’m not. I’m not. I am not a thief. I really am not a thief. My teacher said that I can’t steal things from other people. It’s no good. Mama also said that we must act with honesty and sincerity. Others’ things are their things. My things are my things. A-and… My dad also said…”</span><span style>“Stop!” Ji Yunshu raised her hand to interrupt him.</span><span style>If she let him continue, perhaps he won’t even finish before the sun rose.</span><span style>“Let me ask you. Why are you not at home on such a cold day and instead here?” Ji Yunshu wore a stern expression.</span><span style>Wei Yi withdrew his gaze, pursed his lips, and twisted his hands as his head ducked.</span><span style>If Ji Yunshu didn’t guess incorrectly... this little fool was acting shy! This only further fanned the flames of her curiosity. She came close to him and inquired in a teasing tone, “Wei Yi, tell me the truth. You’re not here for no reason, right? And you’re acting so sneaky.”</span><span style>“I…”</span><span style>“Tell me. I promise I will not tell anyone.”</span><span style>After a long while, Wei Yi finally spilled the beans. “I’m waiting for Big Sister.”</span><i><span style>‘Big Sister? Young man, you’re the only son in your family. You don’t have a big sister. At best, you can have your mom give you a little sister or a little brother. Wait! Can it be...’</span></i><span style>“Wei Yi, your father has another wife? So, are you waiting for your half-sister?”</span><span style>“He doesn’t.” Wei Yi raised his head and looked at Ji Yunshu. Suddenly, he frowned and exclaimed, “Big Brother, you really look like Big Sister!”</span><span style>“Ah!” Immediately, Ji Yunshu understood everything.</span><i></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Foolish guy, you were waiting for me?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Not waiting for Ji Yunshu to come back to her senses, Wei Yi took out a small box from his sleeve and looked at her with eyes full of hope. “Big Brother, do you know Big Sister? I came to give back the handkerchief she put in my hand last time. Look! it was dirty, but I washed it.” When he was done talking, he opened the little box, revealing a white handkerchief neatly folded with several flower petals sprinkled on it.</span><i><span style>‘How lovely! Hey, smelly guy, where did you learn this kind of flirting technique?!’</span></i><span style>The corner of Ji Yunshu’s mouth stretched unnaturally. Her hand rigidly stretched toward the box and slowly closed it. Her hand stayed on the cover.</span><span style>“Wei Yi, this handkerchief… your big sister doesn’t want it. She also doesn’t like the flowers. She’s allergic to pollen.” Ji Yunshu wrinkled her nose as she lied confidently.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But it’s Big Sister’s handkerchief. I have to give it back to her. Ami said that girls like flowers.” Wei Yi appeared aggrieved.</span><span style>“Who is Ami?”</span><span style>“It’s the small dog I raised,” replied Wei Yi innocently.</span><i></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pfft!</span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu held her stomach and spat out imaginary blood.</span><i><span style>‘I’m dying…’ </span></i><span style>She couldn’t understand this fool’s thought process. No matter how much brain capacity she had, it might not be enough to understand him.</span><span style>“Forget it. Stay here then.”</span><span style>She waved at him, turned around, and walked away.</span><span style>She barely took a step or two before she stopped and looked back. Her eyes met with Wei Yi’s apparently dejected expression. He still held onto some hope, touching people’s soft spot.</span><span style>At this moment, snow started to fall again. These snowflakes were denser compared to earlier. As they swirled down from the sky and fell onto his body, the world turned into a silent haze. Unexpectedly, this was a sore sight for one’s heartstrings, evoking a little pity for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Like the snowflakes on his shoulders, her heart melted along with it.</span><span style>Through the curtain of falling snow, Ji Yunshu shouted at Wei Yi, “Come with me. I’ll go find Big Sister for you.”</span><span style>When he heard it, Wei Yi’s face slowly blossomed like a flower. He hurriedly followed behind Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>She lead him into a warm room inside West Side courtyard.</span><span style>It was the first time she’d brought a man into her house. Fortunately, Wei Yi was different from other people!</span><span style>Wei Yi stood in the middle of the reception hall. Then, he turned around several times, observing the decorations inside the room, feeling like everything was quite novel.</span><span style>“Big Brother! Your house is really nice, and it smells good!”</span><span style>“Hurry and sit down. Acting like this when going to other people’s houses is very impolite.”</span><span style>“Oh!.” He shut his mouth and obediently sat down. His eyes no longer looked around in excitement.</span><span style>Right at that moment, Luan’er came in with a bucket of coal. When she saw a man sitting in the reception hall, she was extremely scared, but then she saw her young miss beside him, so she didn’t scream. </span><span style>In small strides, she scampered next to her miss and whispered, “Miss, who is he?”</span><span style>“Wei Yi.”</span><span style>“The Wei family’s idiot?” Luan’er gaped.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu flicked Luan’er’s forehead. “Don’t be rude. Look after him properly. I’m going to go change my clothes.”</span><span style>Luan’er rubbed her painful forehead while nodding obediently.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu put her sandalwood box on the table and left to change her clothes. It only took her a moment. She’d gotten quite used to switching between clothes of the other gender.</span><span style>When she came out, Wei Yi downed a hot cup of tea like he was drinking water.</span><i><span style>‘Won’t his mouth burn? Maybe he was freezing from standing outside.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Just then, Wei Yi noticed Ji Yunshu’s arrival. He put down the cup of tea, and stood up in one motion, an extremely radiant smile on his face.</span><span style>“Big Sister, you came?!” He exclaimed.</span><span style>“</span><i><span style>Hmmm… </span></i><span style>I came.”</span><i><span style>‘In fact, I was always here!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Yi looked behind her and scratched his head. “Where’s Big Brother?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu sat down next to him and poured herself a cup of tea while carelessly replying to him. “Your big brother left.”</span><span style>“Oh!” Wei Yi obediently sat down. Then, he openly stared at Ji Yunshu while his body coiled back. He took the initiative to speak. “Big Sister, do you know why I came here?”</span><span style>“I know. You came to deliver the handkerchief.”</span><span style>After she spoke, Wei Yi was amazed. He still hadn’t said anything, so how did big sister know? </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Foolish child, your big brother told her!’</span></i></p>
