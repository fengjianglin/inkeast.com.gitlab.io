 <p><i><span style>‘He came here to find his ‘Big Brother’?’ </span></i><span style>Magistrate Liu was baffled. He scratched his head while muttering, “That idiot from the Wei family, wasn’t he the only child? Where did that ‘Big Brother’ come from?”</span><span style>No one knew the answer, except for Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>Yesterday night, she merely mentioned that he could look for her at the yamen, but no one expected the young fool to actually do so! </span></p>
 <p><span style>The runner asked, “Milord, what should I do? That idiot refuses to leave.”</span><span style>“What should you do? Drive him away!”</span><span style>“Good, good, good…”</span><span style>The runner was about to go drive Wei Yi away when Ji Yunshu called out, “No need. I’ll go take a look.”</span><span style>The magistrate hastily said, “Yunshu, the food is coming soon!” </span><span style>“Eat, eat, eat! You only know how to eat.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu glanced at him as she walked to the yamen entrance.</span><span style>Her actions made him confused, wasn’t Ji Yunshu’s temper indifferent? Why did she care about that fool?</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the yamen entrance, Wei Yi held onto the drumstick and intended to strike the drum again, but a yamen runner hurriedly grabbed his hand to stop him.</span><span style>“Young Master Wei, quickly let go of that thing. This drum can’t be struck randomly like that.”</span><span style>Wei Yi did not let go. “Big Brother said that I can come to the yamen to find him.”</span><span style>“Your ‘Big Brother’ isn’t here! Also, you don’t have a big brother. Look! It’s snowing heavily, if you stay here, you won’t be able to return home.” When he was done speaking, the runner intended to seize the drumstick.</span><span style>Wei Yi twisted his body and glared at the yamen runner. He puffed his cheeks in anger.</span><span style>He angrily said, “I have a big brother. He said that I can find him here. You must not lie to me! I know he is here.”</span><span style>“Alright, alright! Young Master Wei, oh Great Master Wei! Do you want to find your big brother? I’ll let you go find him, but first, you have to give me the thing in your hands. This thing can’t be touched so casually!”</span><span style>“Don’t wanna!” Wei Yi hid the stick behind his back.</span><span style>The runner could not do anything and was exasperated!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Yi stood straight and declared, “You won’t bring me to find big brother if I give it back to you. I don’t trust you because you can lie to me.”</span><span style>“Heaven bears witness, I absolutely won’t lie to you.”</span><span style>“No way, I still don’t believe you.” As soon as he was done speaking, he raised the stick and was about to strike the drum again.</span><span style>“Stop!” Ji Yunshu’s voice was heard as Wei Yi raised his hand.</span><span style>When he saw that Ji Yunshu came out, Wei Yi became excited and his hands relaxed, letting the drumstick drop, coincidentally hitting the runner’s foot.</span><span style>“Ouch!” The runner raised his leg and frowned from the pain.</span><span style>Wei Yi did not care about him and rushed towards Ji Yunshu. “Big Brother!” He was extremely happy!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What are you running here for?” Ji Yunshu looked at him.</span><span style>“Didn’t Big Brother say that if I want to find you, I just need to go to the yamen?”</span><span style>“If you want to find me, then just go and find me. Why are you striking the drum?” Her gaze swept the announcement drum.</span><span style>Wei Yi raised his eyebrows and replied with great confidence, “Because I saw many people struck the drum first when they came to the yamen. That’s why I did it like everyone. See, after I struck the drum, you came out.</span><i><span style>‘Uhh… That’s logical, but…’</span></i><span style>“Wei Yi, you cannot strike that drum as you wish.” Ji Yunshu warned him carefully.</span><span style>Unfortunately, he understood nothing. He only pointed at the runner, whose foot was still in pain, and asked, “He didn’t let me strike it, why?”</span><i><span style>‘That’s because…’</span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu did not know how to explain it. She simply pulled him and they entered the yamen.</span><span style>She walked in front while he followed behind.</span><span style>It was the first time he went in the yamen, thus he was extremely curious.</span><span style>He looked left-right and right-left, but he did not pay attention and stepped on a stone under the snow and stumbled. His body twisted and staggered. He appeared extremely mischievous!</span><span style>When they entered the inside of the building, Ji Yunshu brushed off the snow on her shoulders.</span><span style>Immediately after, she turned around and her outstretched hand went toward Wei Yi’s shoulders and carefully brushed off the snow piled on them.</span><span style>She muttered, “Next time you fall in the snow, remembered to use your hands to brush off the snow. If the snow melts and seeps into your clothes, you will get a cold.”</span><span style>“Thank you Big Brother!”</span><span style>Wei Yi stood straighter and looked proud while enjoying Ji Yunshu’s attention.</span><span style>Watching his appearance, Ji Yunshu coldly stared at him.</span><i><span style>‘This guy! You know what, I really want to beat you up!’</span></i><span style>Despite his smug appearance, she continued to attentively brush the snow off him.</span><span style>To outsiders, they appeared like a couple, a handsome man and a charming young woman. It simply made others envious! And it caused the magistrate sitting at the dining table behind them to look at them in shock!</span><i><span style>‘W-what is going here?’</span></i><i><span style>‘Since when could the Wei family’s idiot receive such kind treatment from Ji Yunshu?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Magistrate Liu’s heart was unwilling. He stood up and directly wormed his slightly plump figure between both of them.</span><span style>He bumped Ji Yunshu away and “substituted” for her, continuing to brush the snow off Wei Yi. “Let me do it. Yunshu, the food is getting cold. Hurry and eat.” He urged her.</span><span style>The sudden insertion of the magistrate crowded Ji Yunshu away. </span><i><span style>‘Hey, hey, hey! You have such a big build; To squeeze yourself between people like that, don’t you have any shame?’</span></i><span style>Wei Yi noticed that greasy palms were stretching toward his shoulders. Immediately, he became unhappy and retreated several steps back before running off behind Ji Yunshu. He then glared at Magistrate Liu with evident dissatisfaction.</span><span style>“Why are you touching me?”</span><span style>“I want to help you.”</span><span style>“Don’t wanna. I only want Big Brother to help me.”</span><span style>“You-!” Liu Qingping was at a loss for words.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu propped her forehead with her hands while shaking her head. Then, she asked Wei Yi. “Have you eaten something yet?”</span><span style>Wei Yi shook his head. “Not yet.”</span><span style>Therefore, Ji Yunshu pulled him to sit at the dining table.</span><span style>On the table, apart from dishes Ji Yunshu ordered, there was the greasy food that Magistrate Liu liked.</span><span style>“Eat. After we’re done, I’ll bring you somewhere else.” Ji Yunshu stated.</span><span style>“Sure.”</span><span style>Wei Yi picked a bowl and chopsticks and quickly ate.</span><span style>Magistrate Liu returned to his seat and almost exploded.</span><i><span style>‘This idiot is using my bowl and chopsticks! How am I going to eat now?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingping patted Ji Yunshu and asked her, “Yunshu, what’s going on here?”</span><span style>“Guess it.”</span><span style>“I can’t guess.”</span><span style>“Then, don’t guess.” Ji Yunshu grudgingly replied.</span><span style>It was just early morning, yet the magistrate’s complexion had changed several times! </span></p>
 <p><span style>It did not take much time for the food on the table to be engulfed by Wei Yi. Ji Yunshu only ate a bit and Magistrate Liu sat there the whole time, glaring at Wei Yi.</span><span style>“Are you full?” Ji Yunshu asked Wei Yi.</span><span style>Wei Yi rubbed his stomach and replied, “I’m full.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Good, then follow me.” She stopped procrastinating and got up.</span><span style>Wei Yi followed her as he believed that Ji Yunshu will bring him somewhere to play. He could not contain his excitement!</span><span style>Finally, they stopped in front of a door.</span><span style>When the door opened, a strong smell of blood and rot assailed their noses. </span><span style>They directly stood to face a tall table where something was placed on top, covered by a white cloth.</span><span style>“Big Brother, what is this place?” Wei Yi pinched his nose. “It’s so smelly.”</span><span style>“Here… This is where we’re going to have some fun.” Her tone held a hint of teasing.</span><span style>“But Big Brother…” He had yet to complete his sentence when Ji Yunshu pulled him into the room.</span><span style>“This place is the autopsy room.”</span></p>
