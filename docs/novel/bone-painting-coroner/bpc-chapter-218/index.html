 <p><br></p>
 <p><span>Ji Yunshu frowned and asked, “Is there something on my face?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Jing Rong shook his head.</span><span>“Then, why are you looking at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Do you think it’s strange?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“A little bit,” she replied frankly.</span></p>
 <p><span>Jing Rong’s smile grew. “This Prince is only looking at you, there’s no need to be like that. Besides, from now on, I will keep looking at you this way,” he said bluntly, but affectionately.</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Ji Yunshu gave him a cold stare. “You should say that to Miss Kong.” She was obviously hinting to him that he had not asked his father for Kong Yu’s hand.</span><span>&nbsp;Jing Rong’s complexion darkened. He had originally wanted her to retort so he could continue along those lines, but he was rendered speechless by her unexpected words.&nbsp;</span><em><span>‘Forget it! I’d better not say anything more.’&nbsp;</span></em><span>He shifted his gaze to her painting and asked, “What are you painting?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I don’t know.” She put down her brush and picked up the paper. She examined the image of a semi-circular mark that she had discovered at the crime scene. A pattern of irregular strokes and grooves could be seen within it.</span><em><span>&nbsp;‘What could it be?’</span></em><span>&nbsp;Jing Rong looked at the painting in her hands. He narrowed his eyes but still could not understand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Why are you suddenly drawing this? Is it related to the case?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“In fact, I wish it was related to the case. I wouldn’t have to think so much about it if it were.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p><span>She explained to him patiently, “Yuchi Lin’s cause of death was indeed decapitation by sword. What’s more, there was no sign of poisoning. All the evidence points to my eldest brother. However, there was one thing I don’t understand. They were drunk, so their bodies should have been more sluggish than usual. So at the exact moment when the sword cut off his head, his impaired senses would have caused his movements to lack fluidity and he would have been unable to properly apply force. Strangely enough, the cut on the victim’s neck didn’t show any sign of struggle - the wound was neat and level. This is quite abnormal. Moreover, I found a mark behind the door. I hope I’m not overthinking it, but that mark could be a clue.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>The more she talked, the tighter she frowned. Her mind was preoccupied with the origin of this mark.</span><span>&nbsp;Jing Rong put down her drawing after listening to her conjectures. He looked at her and said, “I have never seen this kind of mark. If this is evidence incriminating Ji Li, I’m afraid that the Ji family will fall this time.”</span></p>
 <p><span>The consequences would be inevitable. Ji Li murdered someone; the Ji family could not shirk from the responsibility. In the worst case, in his anger, the Emperor could sentence the whole family to be decapitated.</span><span>&nbsp;They should forget about Ji Muqing becoming the crown prince’s consort; even Ji Wanxin would not be able to marry a high ranking official’s son. It would all become nothing but fantasy. Ji Yunshu could not help but think about her vicious father and all the plans he had made to put his daughters where he wanted. At this moment, his plan had turned to smoke and his face must have turned completely green from all the losses he incurred.&nbsp;</span><span>She hardly pitied him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>Suddenly, Jing Rong said, “Fortunately! They crossed your name out of their genealogy, so even if something happened to them, you would not be involved. Now that I think about it, do you want to change your surname? How about changing it to Jing?”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>‘Are you crazy? Jing is the imperial family surname!’&nbsp;</span></em><span>Ji Yunshu was stunned. She was about to retort, but Jing Rong timely cut her off.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Anyway, sooner or later, you will be mine. So, changing your name to Jing Yunshu now is also good. Besides, Jing Yunshu is more pleasant to hear than Ji Yunshu.”</span></p>
 <p><em><span>‘Pleasant to hear, damn your sister!’&nbsp;</span></em><span>Ji Yunshu was speechless.&nbsp;</span><em><span>‘Forget it!’</span></em><span>&nbsp;She shook her head, feeling helpless. She folded the painting and put it in her sleeve before walking out.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Where are you going?” Jing Rong asked.</span><span>She replied without turning back to him, “Yuhua Pavilion!” She promised Wei Yi to visit him every day, so she could not break her promise.</span><span>Jing Rong expression looked as though he had drunk fermented vinegar. Out of jealousy, he immediately chased after Ji Yunshu but was stopped by Lang Po.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“What?!” he rudely spat out.</span><span>“General Ji has entered the palace. He beseeched the Emperor to release his older brother. His Majesty expelled him, but he didn’t give up and kneeled outside for several hours like a mule. His Majesty was &nbsp;infuriated and, in anger, he sent General Ji to the Ministry of Justice’s prison.”</span><em><span>Huh?</span></em></p>
 <p><span>“When?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Just after we left the prison, they escorted him in.”</span><span>Jing Rong shook his head. It was written on his face how he despised an idiot like Ji Huan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“He obviously knew Imperial Father’s temper. What drug did he take to decide to ram head-on into a wall like that? Everyone from the Ji family is so stubborn.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Your Highness, do you want to inform Teacher Ji about it?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“She should know. I’m only worried that she will be distracted by her two older brothers who want to kill her. She should focus on the case instead. If something happens, I’m afraid she will be dragged into this mess.” He sighed.</span><span>..........</span></p>
 <p><span>When Ji Yunshu arrived at Yuhua Pavilion, the place was as crowded as ever. Mo Ruo’s title as God Doctor was not useless. After she entered, she heard an apprentice say that Mo Ruo was drinking wine in the attic and Wei Yi was looking after him.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>‘Looking after him? How odd!’&nbsp;</span></em><span>She climbed up to the attic with curiosity in her heart. As soon as she entered the attic, a smell assailed her nose and it was not the scent of medicinal herbs, but that of wine.</span><span>&nbsp;She saw Mo Ruo lying on the bamboo chair. His eyes slightly narrowed as he took another sip from his wine bottle. One of his feet was on the floor while the other was raised, shaking restlessly on the chair. He looked very idle as if he had thrown the matter of Kong Yu getting married far away to the back of his mind.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Shu’er!” She suddenly heard Wei Yi’s happy voice. The latter was holding two bottles of mulled wine. As soon as he saw her, he welcomed her with a huge smile.</span></p>
 <p><span>“Having fun?” Ji Yunshu asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>He nodded strongly. “It’s fun! Big Brother Mo Ruo is good to me.” The smile on his face became more obvious as he spoke.</span></p>
 <p><em><span>‘Oh? Didn’t he dislike Mo Ruo before? How come he calls him so sweetly today? Did Mo Ruo buy Wei Yi tanghulu and subdue him like this?’</span></em></p>
 <p><span>Ji Yunshu smiled and walked to Mo Ruo. She sat down gently and looked at him. “Are you drinking away your worries?”</span></p>
 <p><span>Mo Ruo closed his eyes. The corner of his mouth curled up. “Qujiang’s general is dead, so why would I need to drink away my worries?”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Huh? Young Master Mo, I don’t understand what you mean.”</span></p>
 <p><span>He opened one eye and looked at the medicinal ingredients hung above his head. He spoke slowly. “Since General Yuchi died, the marriage proposal will fall through, and Kong Yu will not get married. That’s why I am happy and relaxed.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“You two are so unlike each other,” Ji Yunshu suddenly stated.</span></p>
 <p><span>“You mean Jing Rong?” Mo Ruo specified.</span></p>
 <p><span>“If I didn’t guess wrongly, you should have been depressed because of Miss Kong’s marriage to Qujiang, right? Prince Rong isn’t like you, he obviously had meant to help her, but he didn’t. That’s why I said you two are different.”</span></p>
 <p><span>Mo Ruo asked, “Then, let me ask you, did Jing Rong meet Kong Yu?”</span><span>She nodded but shook her head soon after.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“I’m not sure. Before the banquet last evening, he left, but I can’t ascertain if he went to meet Miss Kong or for something else.”</span></p>
 <p><span>At that moment, Mo Ruo propped himself up. He earnestly told her, “If he had the slightest desire to save Kong Yu, he would have met her. I’m sure that he went to see her. She must have said something to him that made him give up saving her.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“I don’t understand.”</span></p>
 <p><span>“Then, let me explain to you, Miss Ji.” Mo Ruo smiled as if he found it a waste to explain too much. He leaned back in his chair and closed his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span>“Kong Yu is the most intelligent between us three. She is very fully aware that Jing Rong will certainly do his best to stop this political marriage. She was worried that this would harm Jing Rong, so that’s why she refused his help and willingly married.”</span></p>

 <p>Suddenly, I feel like eating tanghulu. Well, you know those apple coated sugar? Tanghulu used the same principle, but instead of apple, you coated smaller fruits which I think it's less tiring to eat than an apple. The combination of sugar + chinese hawthorn fruit give a perfectly balance flavor of sweet and sour.</p>
