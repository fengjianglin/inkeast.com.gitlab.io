 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span class="hidden-text">Original and most updated translations are from volare. If read elsewhere, this chapter has been stolen. Please stop supporting theft.</span><span style>After walking with a slow pace, they finally arrived at the Grand Canal Manor. </span><span style>Two guards, armed with longswords, stood on each side of the entrance with a dignified aura. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu had passed by the manor before, and each time, the doors were closed shut. This time, the doors were wide open to welcome Jing Rong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Yi raised his head and pulled on one of Ji Yunshu’s large sleeves, “Big Brother, where are we?” </span><span style>Ji Yunshu replied by pointing at the wooden panel which hung on top of the entrance, “Do you know how to read that?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes it’s ‘Guang’…[1. </span><span style>Grand Canal Manor comes from the Chinese </span><i><span style>Guangquyuan, </span></i><span style>with the second character, </span><i><span style>Qu, </span></i><span style>being the most rarely encountered character amongst the three. Therefore, it is assumed that Wei Yi would not know how to pronounce such a character.]” </span><span style>&nbsp;Wei Yi scratched his chin as he looked at the second character. He stared at the panel, but couldn’t come up with an answer. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu squinted at him and explained patiently, “</span><i><span style>Guang-Qu-Yuan, </span></i><span style>Grand Canal Manor, just remember that the character is pronounced </span><i><span style>Qu</span></i><span style>, alright?”</span><span style>“Yes, I’ll remember that it’s called ‘</span><i><span style>Qu’</span></i><span style>,” repeated Wei Yi. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The excitement from learning something new was obvious in Wei Yi’s voice. Ji Yunshu looked at him with a radiant smile, which let through some tenderness for Wei Yi and his childish behavior. </span></p>
 <p><span style>As they climbed the stairs leading to the entrance of the manor, the guards stopped them with a gesture. </span><span style>“Who are you?” The guard asked. </span><span style>“I am here to pay a visit to Prince Rong.” Ji Yunshu answered. </span><span style>The guards exchanged a look and asked, “Are you Teacher Ji?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Looks like that fellow had planned for my arrival!</span></i><span style>’ Ji Yunshu thought as she answered the two guards with a slight nod. </span><span style>The two guards backed off and one of them said, “Please follow us, the prince has been waiting for a long time already.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>A long time? Didn’t he say the hour of the dragon? I’m right on time!</span></i><span style>’</span><span style>Ji Yunshu and Wei Yi followed the guard into the manor. </span><span style>Grand Canal Manor was once occupied by an affluent family who later migrated to the capital. Despite being deserted for so long, it was reputed for its luxury and grandeur, as much in terms of the size of the building as for the objects which furnished it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>It definitely lives up to its reputation.</span></i><span style>’</span></p>
 <p><span style>It took quite a bit of walking just to get through the reception hall to the backyard. </span><span style>Wei Yi stretched his neck to look around and seemed very curious about the surroundings. From time to time, he would pull onto Ji Yunshu’s sleeve.</span><span style>He pointed at a lotus flower which emerged from a pond nearby and said, “Hey, I have that in my house.” </span><span style>A moment later, he pointed at a large cedar tree, exclaiming in surprise. “I have that too!” </span><span style>Again, an instant later, pointing at a stone statue of a mythical animal, “That too!”</span><i><span style>‘Yes, yes, yes, I get it, you have everything in your house.’ </span></i><i><span style>‘Well, I don’t even have any of these in mine!’</span></i><span style>For anyone who was not acquainted with their relationship, it seemed that she was being importuned by such a deadweight. At least, this was what Jing Rong thought upon seeing the duo. </span><span style>The instant the guard brought the two into the backyard, Jing Rong, who was seated under a pavilion, noticed Wei Yi, who followed Ji Yunshu closely and clung onto her sleeves. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>A deadweight? And a male one?</span></i><span style>’ Jing Rong thought, with some irritation shown on his face. He poured a cup of tea from the teapot and its pleasant aroma soon inundated the air around him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu saluted him with a hand gesture. “This humble one greets Prince Rong.”</span><span style>Wei Yi, who held onto Ji Yunshu’s sleeves, was dragged into her salutation as when the latter rose her arms, he stumbled forward and interposed himself between Jing Rong and Ji Yunshu. </span><span style>Jing Rong sipped his tea, examined Wei Yi and threw a cold look full of dissatisfaction at Ji Yunshu. “Is that your lover?”</span><span style>Wei Yi answered before Ji Yunshu could speak. “A lover? What’s that? Is it some kind of food?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Pfft~!</span></i><span style>The tea that barely entered Jing Rong’s mouth almost got spit back out. A frown on his face indicated that he was perplexed at the comical answer. </span><i><span style>‘Where did this weirdo come from?’</span></i><span style> Jing Rong wondered. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span style>Ji Yunshu stepped forward, dragged Wei Yi and explained, “Prince, this is my friend. He’s not very smart and will tend to say weird things sometimes, so please forgive his transgression.”</span><span style>“Your friend? Not very smart?” Jing Rong repeated her words, thinking about her words for a short while before coming to an understanding. He nodded and asked, “What’s his name?”</span><span style>Wei Yi jumped to answer again, “I’m called Wei Yi, Wei as in a seat, and Yi as in one.”[2. This is a wordplay on the fact that <i>Wei</i> is a homophone for “seat” (位) which could also be a classifier for person, while <i>Yi</i> is a homophone for “one”, which are obviously not used for proper names. It's like Wei Yi is saying his name meant something like "The one and only one" since the literal meaning is "one person".]</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>…Why did you have to speak now?</span></i><span style>’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu’s expression was one frozen in awkwardness, and she resisted the urge to let out a sigh. Right now, it was really kind of embarrassing to be with this ‘friend’ of hers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>I finally got it right!’</span></i><span style> Wei Yi thought, who was visibly satisfied from being able to answer Jing Rong’s question. He clearly did not share any of Ji Yunshu’s worries. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu then hurriedly spoke to help him out. “Prince, Wei means protection, and Yi means being in high spirits.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She expected disdain from Jing Rong, but, instead, she saw curiosity shining in his eyes as he scrutinized Wei Yi with a playful smile on his face. </span><span style>“Teacher Ji, that’s an unusual mistake for a bright person like you to make, I think that it </span><i><span style>is</span></i><span style> Wei as in a seat and Yi as in one.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, yes, of course!” Wei Yi seemed to agree with the statement and nodded energetically. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong stood up, walked to Wei Yi and asked with a broad smile. “Wei Yi, do you know then, the meaning of true comity for a gentleman?[1. </span><span style>The meaning of true comity for a gentlemen: the original word in Chinese used here is 君子, a concept made famous by Confucius’ Analects, representing an ideal that all men ought to seek to achieve. It roughly translates to gentleman, but is more than that.] &nbsp;</span><span style>”</span><span style>“What’s that?” Wei Yi asked. </span><span style>“Take a guess!” Jing Rong said. </span><span style>“My teacher hasn’t taught me any of that, and neither did my mom nor my dad,” Wei Yi said to himself, he seemed pensive and turned around to ask Ji Yunshu. “Big Brother, do you know what it means?” </span><i><span style>Of course</span></i><span style> she knew. </span><i><span style>‘A gentleman does not rob another of his cherishment.’</span></i><i><span style>‘I wonder what he means by that.’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu felt the frustration mount up in her mind and chose to stop thinking about it. She threw a stern look at Jing Rong and said, “Prince Rong, your humble servant would like to remind you that the five burnt corpses constitute our current priority, and there are a few things I would like to inform you about.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh, so you </span><i><span style>do</span></i><span style> remember that there’s case waiting for us to solve? And here I am, thinking that you came here with your </span><i><span style>friend </span></i><span style>to have tea with me,” said Jing Rong with a particular emphasis on the word “friend”. </span><span style>“Please forgive me, prince Rong. If you find his behavior to be disagreeable, I shall ask him to vacate the premises,” answered Ji Yunshu. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s no need for that. Anyone who enters my door is a guest, and I’m not so indecent as to deny anyone of my hospitality,” Jing Rong answered as he raised his hand. &nbsp;</span><span style>Jing Rong’s gesture served as a signal to Lang Po, who entered the backyard and approached him. </span><span style>“What orders do you have for me, prince?” asked Lang Po. </span><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Woah! You were here the whole time? You could have greeted us at least!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Please bring teacher Ji’s friend to a side yard. Give him anything that’ll please his heart, and every delicacy that’ll satisfy his stomach. Treat his wishes as my orders,” Jing Rong instructed. </span><span style>“Understood.” Lang Po replied. </span><span style>Lang Po stepped forward, lowered his head as he approached Wei Yi, and said, “Sir, please follow me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Yi clearly thought otherwise. He hid behind Ji Yunshu and shook his head. “No! I want to stay with Big Brother! I’ll go wherever he goes!” </span><span style>“Sir…” Lang Po did not really know how to respond to Wei Yi. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu’s turned around to look at Wei Yi, and said in a tender voice. “Wei Yi, if you want to stay with me, then please be nice and go wait for me, okay? I’ll come for you when I’m done here.” </span><span style>“Big Brother.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come on, go,” said Ji Yunshu in a firm tone. </span><span style>Wei Yi seemed very upset. His hands, which were still holding onto Ji Yunshu’s sleeves, only relaxed their grip after a long while. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big Brother, you will remember to pick me up, okay? I don’t know the way home.” </span><span style>“Don’t worry, I’ll come look for you,” Ji Yunshu assured him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Only after receiving a guarantee from Ji Yunshu did Wei Yi move. Even then, he departed reluctantly, and kept turning around at nearly every step he took. It seemed like a farewell of life and death to him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Both Ji Yunshu and Wei Yi did not notice Jing Rong’s face getting darker!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Not only was it getting darker, there was also a burning jealousy! </span></p>
