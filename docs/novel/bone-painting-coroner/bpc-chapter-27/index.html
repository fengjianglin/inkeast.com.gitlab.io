 <p><span style>The crystal candlestick? The one that Miss Zhou lit every night?</span><span style>Jing Rong had an angry and annoyed face, but in an instant, his sharp features loosened into surprise.</span><span style>“Don’t tell me there’s a problem with that candlestick?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu pondered for a moment. The more she thought about it, the more her mind was nagging her about an oversight, but the murderers had been apprehended already. They couldn’t possibly have overlooked something!</span><span style>Thus, she shook her head and answered him, “It’s nothing… I must be overthinking things.”</span><span style>She slightly lowered the umbrella in her hand and resumed walking.</span><i><span style>‘This scholar, he seems covered in a veil of mysteries. He speaks in a way that I’m unable to guess his thoughts!’</span></i><span style>Jing Rong caught up to her in a few strides. At the same time, he rolled his eyes and asked, “I still have some doubts, do you mind enlightening me?”</span><span style>“Are you thinking about why I told Lord Liu to deploy his troops around Zhou mansion?”</span><span style>“How perceptive!”</span><i><span style>‘Oh!’ </span></i><span style>He hadn’t even asked yet, but the scholar’s guess was spot on! Jing Rong nodded with an extremely pleased impression. “I simply don’t understand how you could determine that the murderer was among the people inside Zhou mansion? Also, how did you foresee them staying in the mansion, awaiting capture? &nbsp;If this Prince was the murderer, I would have long escaped, far from here!”</span><span style>“Your Highness, think about it. If the murderer was able to put poison in the medicinal concoction of Miss Zhou, and could secretly bring the body to the attic without being discovered, it signifies that this person was extremely familiar with the layout of the Zhou family’s mansion. It had a higher probability than the culprit being a stranger, so if I eliminate Lord Zhou and Madame Zhou from the suspects list, all that was left were the servants. Since the murderer didn’t want people to suspect him about Miss Zhou’s faked accidental fall, it wasn’t necessary for him to escape either. In addition, all the servants in this mansion have signed a slave contract, which means that if one of them had gone missing, a report would’ve been sent to the yamen. However, ever since Miss Zhou’s death, the yamen had yet to receive such a notice from the Zhou family. Therefore, I could deduce that the murderer was still inside the Zhou mansion.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And then?”</span><span style>“The murderer certainly didn’t imagine that his meticulous plan would be exposed, which left him extremely afraid. With such thoughts, he might want to escape, so when Lord Liu left yesterday, I told him about this matter and had him deploy people in the vicinity, taking some measures in case the murderers did try to escape. If he did escape, the yamen runners would be able to catch him red-handed.”</span><span style>“To sum it all up, when you arranged everything with Lord Liu beforehand, you still didn’t know the identity of the murderer.” Jing Rong narrowed his eyes.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu nodded. “If I knew, there would be no need for me to stay for a night, and I probably wouldn’t have discovered that the murderer was in fact two people. It would have ended with Miss Zhou probably dying with remaining grievances. I was surprised that Suyun practically delivered herself to the door. It was also by chance that I saw her handkerchief. This is truly Heaven’s will. It’s really not an exaggeration!”</span><span style>At this moment, Jing Rong’s heart gave birth to a sincere admiration for her! But in an instant, his face tensed with distress. With some rebuke in his tone, he told Ji Yunshu, “Teacher, since you are this intelligent, how could you use such a clumsy method to draw out the second murderer? If it wasn’t for me, perhaps, you would have already been sent to the doctor.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu became aware of his small guts. </span><i><span style>‘You’re still thinking about that?! Didn’t I let you help me out?!’ </span></i><span style>He was clearly reprimanding her, but why was he showing such strong worry and deep concern?</span><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t want to ponder too deeply about it.</span><span style>“If that method could draw out the murderer, it was worth taking the risk. What harm could there be?”</span><span style>“You’re really eloquent!”</span><span style>“Since this humble one has cleared your highness’ doubts then, we should also part ways here. You’re not planning to follow me home, right?”</span><span style>Jing Rong’s indignant face unexpectedly became radiant. He observed Ji Yunshu’s round and lukewarm face.</span><span style>“If you have a spare bed at home to accommodate this Prince, I’m willing to follow you home. What harm could there be?”</span><i><span style>‘Don’t tell me that a monarch’s child could actually be this shameless?’</span></i><span style>“My house is a lowly abode that does not befit your status. I will take my leave, no need to accompany me.”</span><span style>As she threw these words, she swiftly accelerated, and quickly walked away.</span><span style>This Jing Rong was like a sticky candy. Instead of leaving obligingly, he dashed forward. In an instant, a strong gale tousled Ji Yunshu’s gown. Then, right in front of her, stood the tall and ramrod Jing Rong, blocking her way.</span><span style>His tall height and her short stature stood diametrically opposite of each other.</span><span style>If she didn’t have the umbrella above her head, considering their difference of height, her head would have bumped into Jing Rong’s chest… again. </span><span style>As Ji Yunshu raised her head, her eyes locked onto Jing Rong’s.</span><span style>This unexpected meeting of their eyes caused both their hearts to skip a beat! Unexpectedly, Jing Rong was the first to initiate the conversation. “Are you thinking about abandoning me?”</span><span style>“Huh?” The question disturbed Ji Yunshu’s heart, causing her ears to turn a brighter shade of red. Fortunately, her hair concealed the change.</span><span style>“Don’t forget that when this case was closed, you must investigate my case. Could you have forgotten about this matter?”</span><span style>Jing Rong’s eyebrows rose, and his tone turned somewhat overbearing.</span><i></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘It turns out to be that case!’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu let out a sigh. For no rhyme or reason, to suddenly spout out “don’t abandon me”, it really would cause people’s imagination to run wild!</span><span style>She told him, “Prince, a hanging man also need to breathe. Can you let this humble one rest for a night and investigate your case tomorrow?”</span><span style>“Who told you not to properly rest yesterday night?”</span><span style>The rhetorical comeback left her speechless!</span><i></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Hey! Your Highness, I didn’t rest last night in order to solve this case! Unlike you who didn’t properly eat your supper!’</span></i><span style><span>Witnessing Ji Yunshu speechlessness, Jing Rong showed off a winner’s magnanimity. “It’s decided then! This prince isn’t inhuman. You want to rest? Then, I’ll let you rest during the day. Tonight at the hour of the rooster<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, I’ll wait for you at the memorial hall. If in the end, the five corpses rot, it will be more laborious for Teacher to investigate.”</span></span><span style>This person’s brain was really full of shit!</span><span style>She only needs the bones to investigate!</span><span style>This was inhumane. The night was bitterly cold and she hadn’t slept a wink, how could resting during the day be enough?</span><span style>But...</span><span style>“As you wish, your Highness. This humble one does not dare to not be present. I will see you at the memorial hall tonight, at the rooster hour.”</span><span style>When he heard her promise, although the wording showed obedience and comprehension, how come it felt quite uncomfortable to the ears?</span><span style>He turned around and watched her delicate figure gradually getting further away. The corner of his mouth slightly rose into a smile, an intoxicated smile that made it seem like he was drunk on an aged wine.</span><span style>Lang Po, who was watching over them from a distance, arrived in front of Prince Rong in a matter of moments.</span><span style>“Prince, You and Teacher Ji… Did you mention the Imperial Duke’s case?”</span><span style>Jing Rong’s expression froze on the spot. His previously gentle eyes turned into icebergs.</span><span style>“There’s no hurry. Perhaps behind this case, there are numerous people involved. Although Teacher Ji is intelligent, I cannot easily trust him. If there is a mistake, all the blame would fall on me.”</span><span style>“This subordinate understands.”</span><span style>Jing Rong felt some doubts, thus he immediately instructed Lang Po. “Secretly investigate everything related to Teacher Ji. The people this prince wants must have a completely clean background.”</span><span style>Lang Po bowed his head. “Yes, your highness.”</span><span style>Jing Rong took a deep breath of cold air. His gaze was still fixed on Ji Yunshu’s back that was rapidly vanishing into the distance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>To solve the Imperial Duke’s case, he had already left the capital for half a year. </span><span style>But if Ji Yunshu was trustworthy, then his return to the capital wouldn’t be far away!</span></p>
