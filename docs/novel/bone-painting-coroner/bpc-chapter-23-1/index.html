 <p></p>
 <p><span style>That night, Ji Yunshu did not sleep. Instead, she stood under the eaves, watching the water dripping from the tiles and turning into ice. She watched as the icicles formed and grew, sparkling and translucent, from the rooftops.</span><span style>When Jing Rong pushed open his door and appeared, he happened to see her standing there, dressed in a white gown made of hemp. Her bun was untied and her hair had unfurled to her waist. Her inky eyes were transfixed on the steadily dripping icicle. The light reflecting off the snow shone upon her, highlighting her delicate figure as she stood there. As the snow fell, it called its companion, the cold wind, to come and play. It snuck around her, making her sleeves swing gently and ruffling a few stray strands of her hair.</span><span style>It was a scene hard to come by!</span></p>
 <p><span style>It suddenly dawned on Jing Rong as his soul stirred. His thin lips faintly hooked up as he walked towards Ji Yunshu. He too gazed at the sky filled with snow. Then, he stretched his hand out, catching several snowflakes on his palm.</span><span style>“Teacher, did you watch the snow fall the whole night?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu remained silent.</span><span style>“Did you get frostbite? Are you mute?” Jing Rong asked.</span><span style>She shook her head, still wordless, and withdrew her gaze from the roof. She shot a quick glance at him and broke her silence with a rhetorical question, “I wonder if Prince Rong slept well on Zhou Mansion’s padauk bed?”</span><span style>“I didn’t sleep well.”</span><span style>“Oh? On the contrary, I believe you had a very good night of sleep.”</span><span style>Hearing her words, Jing Rong’s interest became stronger. He raised his long eyebrow and asked, “Then, do enlighten me. How can you prove that this prince slept well on this cold winter night?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu calmly sized him up before speaking with confidence. “This humble one remembers there was a jade pendant tied to your Highness’ waist yesterday night. If I’m not wrong, it was hung 2.5cm below the waist, but right now, that isn’t so. In fact, it’s hung around 7.5cm lower. What’s more, your Highness’ clothes are tidy. Not to mention, you’re meticulously well-dressed. These few points are enough to reveal that your mental state is clear-headed and that you slept well. Besides, the regions around your cheekbones are raised, allowing the contours of your eyes to be slightly swollen. This is a sign that is mostly seen in people who have had a peaceful night of deep sleep.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After her point by point assessment, she asked, “I don’t know if my analysis was correct?” </span><span style>Jing Rong was shocked. He had met countless people with extraordinary talent while he was traveling, but this young scholar was one of the most intelligent people he had met.</span><span style>He could not help but sigh and shake his head. “This is truly unfortunate.”</span><span style>“Why is your Highness saying that?”</span><span style>“Such a tiny and insignificant city like Jinjiang might not be able to contain Teacher.”</span><span style>Jing Rong stopped speaking, but a mysterious smile hung on his face.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu observed him for a moment, but dismissed it, not bothering to inquire further.</span><span style>At this moment, a maidservant braved the snowy weather and ran into the reception hall. When she arrived in front of them, she said, “Teacher Ji, Madame sent this servant here to inquire if you have found the murderer?”</span><span style>Your own daughter was apparently killed by someone. As a mother, being anxious about it was quite normal.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu was resolute. “I will have to trouble you to invite Lord Zhou and Madame Zhou to the mourning hall.”</span><span style>“Right now?”</span><span style>“Correct. I want to invite them right now. In addition, summon everyone else in the mansion.”</span><span style>The maidservant displayed a bewildered expression, but she wrapped her arms around herself and faced the whistling cold wind again to go inform everyone.</span><span style>Jing Rong knitted his eyebrows. “Isn’t better if we eat breakfast before going?”</span><span style>If it could’ve, Ji Yunshu’s glare would have simultaneously burned and frozen him. Then, she spoke to him in a mocking tone, “If your Highness properly ate last night’s supper, you would be unlikely to care about this morning’s breakfast.”</span><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Who told you not to eat yesterday, serves you right!’</span></i><span style>Without waiting for Jing Rong to refute her, she started walking towards the mourning hall.</span><span style>This was the first time Jing Rong was rendered truly speechless by someone. His bright and stern eyes were bored into Ji Yunshu’s straight back. His expression was cool, seemingly without anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In the end, he still had to bury his vexation, and follow behind!</span><span style>Thus, a man with a sour face thought long and hard about punishing Ji Yunshu.</span></p>
 <p>..........</p>
 <p><span style>The mourning hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Top to bottom, the more than 20 people in the mansion were already present.</span><span style>Lord Zhou’s expression was grave. His face was slightly drooping, and his forehead had acquired new wrinkles.</span><span style>Beside him, Madame Zhou no longer wailed nor wept endlessly. Her complexion was also much better. However, her eyes continued to redden every time she looked at the coffin containing her daughter.</span><span style>“Teacher Ji, the proper time to bury my daughter has passed. If we don’t bury her today, I worry that my daughter’s body will…” Lord Zhou didn’t finish his words, as a sigh replaced what was left unsaid.</span><span style>A corpse left alone for a few days would begin to exude a putrid smell. What’s more, Miss Zhou’s corpse had smashed into the ground, leaving most parts broken and her flesh burst open. Even if it was January, the corpse’s stench was becoming quite overpowering.</span></p>
