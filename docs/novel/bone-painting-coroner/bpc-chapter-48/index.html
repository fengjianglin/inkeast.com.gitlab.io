 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘He’s gone crazy! Crazy! Definitely crazy!’ silently screamed Ji Yunshu.</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Who has ever heard of a “man” taking care of another man?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu widened her eyes as she twisted her wrist, her expression showing her hesitation. “Prince, this one is clumsy. And even providing for my daily needs is a problem. Must your Highness make things difficult for me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You feel that I am troubling you?” His eyebrows raised.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, your Highness.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A slight pause later, he threw down a simple statement. “Then I guess I am.” Saying so, he released her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her wrist having obtained freedom after much hardship, Ji Yunshu immediately retreated a couple of steps. She hid both of her hands in her sleeves.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet she didn’t expect that Jing Rong would walk around the table toward her. As he closed in on her, Ji Yunshu tensed up. She immediately raised her sleeves and hid her hands behind her back. That small action was rather adorable in Jing Rong’s eyes!</span></p>
 <p><span style>He halted around 25 cm away from her. The corner of his lip curled upwards. “The thing I like to do the most is trouble others, while I am most interested in threatening others. Teacher Ji, of the two, which would you pick?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Screw you. Do I even have a choice? Are you blaming me for your injury?</span></i><span style>’ thought Ji Yunshu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>While Jing Rong was entertaining other thoughts.‘</span><i><span style>Are you blaming me for you not being able to provide for yourself?</span></i><span style>’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu’s face alternated between green and white as she slowly backed away. Those eyes, like two pools of starry ink, were filled with dissatisfaction as she glared at him.</span><span style>“Prince Rong, you shouldn’t bully people like this.”</span><span style>“Oh, I forgot to mention something. I absolutely love bullying others.” Pride emanated in waves from between his brows.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>Ji Yunshu stayed silent. “...” She couldn’t even be bothered to count how many black lines had appeared on her forehead by now.<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>Her lips trembled; there was nothing she could say!</span></span><span style>Jing Rong was very satisfied with her reaction. His eyes were filled with a teasing light as he narrowed them slightly. His feet didn’t move, yet his body drew closer to Ji Yunshu.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be it that I’m troubling you or threatening you or maybe even bullying you. My injury is under your responsibility. If my arm fails to recover later on, don’t even think about escaping because you’ll have to replace my hand for the rest of your life.”</span><i><span style>Ugh!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu had to admit. His tone which made people want to beat him up actually made her feel all tingly from her ears all the way to her chest just by listening to it. Her heart pounded intensely, which couldn’t help but make her feel scared!</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘What’s wrong with me?’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Rather abruptly, she shifted her gaze from his by lowering it. Her embarrassed look was completely caught by Jing Rong. He was very happy! And totally smug about it too!</span><span style>Curling those icy thin lips of his, his long fingers stretched out from within his sleeves towards Ji Yunshu’s hat, as if his hand was itching to pull out the pin holding it up, letting her hair unfurled in a cascade.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu’s head was still lowered so she didn’t know about his intention!</span><span style>Those fingertips drew closer. Yet at the last moment, Jing Rong’s gaze just so happened to catch a glimpse of the book left on the table.</span><span style>It was </span><i><span style>The Case of Lin Capital</span></i><span style>!</span></p>
 <p><span style>His hand paused. His gaze changed from its original flirtatiousness to a strange glint as his expression froze.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He circled around Ji Yunshu and walked over, picking up the book. As he held the book in his hand, he asked her, “You’ve read this?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu had already turned around to look at him when he walked away, and upon hearing his question, answered, “I’ve flipped through a few pages.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then do you know what </span><i><span style>The Case of Lin Capital</span></i><span style> is about?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s mainly about the case involving the Imperial Duke’s household.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do you know about the contents?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ve just started reading so, I’m unaware of the details.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A question, an answer; the conversation flowed without a hitch!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s expression became solemn as he emitted a faint </span><i><span style>“Hmm”</span></i><span style> while passing the book to Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>“In that case, I am giving you three days time to get familiarized with the contents of this book. In two days, I will be waiting for you at Grand Canal Manor on the west side of the city.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was the first time Ji Yunshu had seen such a serious expression on Jing Rong’s face. His gaze contained mystery and a hint of anxiety, causing others to feel anxious too!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She reached out to receive the book and asked in a soft voice. “Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong maintained his solemness. “After you have familiarized yourself with the contents, I will tell you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet Ji Yunshu seemed as if she was born this clever. With suspicion in her heart, she asked, “Does it have anything to do with… the case of those 72 corpses Your Highness mentioned?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His expression crumpled slightly! He had to admit, Ji Yunshu was too smart! At the same time, this only went to prove that he hadn’t found the wrong person!</span><span style>But...</span><span style>“This matter is of grave importance. I cannot tell you everything right now, but the one thing I can, is that the reason I have left the capital for half a year is for this matter.”</span><span style>Ever since the founding of the empire of the Great Lin, whenever imperial princes received their titles, no land would be bestowed to them. The place that they lived in was usually a mansion in the capital. One reason for this was so that their father would be able to better keep an eye on them. Another reason was to stop them from raising their own private forces and rebelling.</span><span style>Thus, for an Imperial Prince to leave the capital was a large matter. This was because it raised the risk of said Prince raising his own troops in rebellion or defecting to another country and using those troops to seize power!</span><span style>Emperors were always prone to suspicion and paranoia. It was an illness that all monarchs share from time immemorial.</span><span style>Because of this, the current Emperor of the Great Lin dynasty, Qi Zhen Emperor, issued a decree declaring that any Imperial Princes that left the capital had to report their whereabouts every three days. The moment there was any delay, it would immediately be assumed that they had the intention to rebel!</span></p>
 <p><span style>And those five burnt bodies just so happened to be the people Jing Rong had sent to report to the capital. Yet he hadn’t expected them to be assassinated halfway!</span><span style>For Jing Rong to have left the capital, and for half a year no less, really caused many people to feel surprised. It could be inferred from this how major this “Lin’s Capital Case” was!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu nodded, and didn’t continue to question him. “Yes, this humble one will closely analyze the contents in this book.”</span><span style>Her obedience sent a warm glow through Jing Rong.</span><span style>Dropping his stern countenance, he smiled warmly. “Then I shouldn’t bother you any further. Have a good look, and we’ll meet two days from now, at dawn. Don’t be late.” Having said so, he left with a flick of his sleeves!</span><span style>The study quietened down in an instant.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu clutched the heavy book to her chest. The patterns on the book’s cover were like ripples on the surface of the water, the ups and downs seemingly reflecting the emotions fluctuating within her heart!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She gently placed the book down. ‘Better finish up the report, so I can go home and start on this book!’</span></p>
 <p><span style>Roughly in the time it takes to brew a cup of tea later, the report was finalized. It was laid out on the desk, the words on it delicate and orderly. This was the calligraphy skill she had honed over the greater half of a year since transmigrating here. It had taken her quite a bit of effort!</span><span style>She didn’t wait for the magistrate to come in to collect it, instead simply carrying the book as she left the yamen.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the way back she was quite distracted. Suyun kept occupying her thoughts. A perfectly fine woman, yet for the sake of her lover, she hadn’t feared dying!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t understand that kind of love.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At least as of right now, she hasn’t met that someone who she would be willing to sacrifice her life to protect.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She remained distracted by her train of thought until it got disrupted after reaching the Ji Mansion. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon opening the door to her courtyard, she could hear the sounds of objects being smashed!</span><span style>Four or five servants were holding sticks and using them to smash the flower pots in her courtyard. The ground was littered with shards of pottery and upturned dirt. Torn and tattered pieces of vegetation were scattered everywhere.</span><span style>“Please stop smashing, Third Young Master. I’m begging you please don’t smash those. These were all carefully cultivated by the Young Miss. Please Third Young Master, don’t smash those!” Luan’er’s choked sobs made their way to Ji Yunshu’s ears.</span></p>
