 <p><span style>“You said I am perceptive. Are you praising me?”</span><span style>He felt a trace of happiness in his heart.</span><span style>He raised his eyebrows as he looked at her. His exquisite face made people unable to shift their eyes away from him.</span><span style>Yet, Ji Yunshu quickened her pace and left him behind.</span><span style>Jing Rong didn’t let the matter go as he pressed her for a clear answer. “Tell me. Were you praising me just now?”</span><span style>He kept up with her pace while continuing to pester her like a hoodlum.</span><span style>“Teacher Ji, tell me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong turned around and pulled on Ji Yunshu’s sleeve which made her lower her eyebrows while she gave him a supercilious look.</span><span style>Right now, they have no time to spare with the case on their hands, but that deity was actually still in the mood to investigate that trivial matter.</span></p>
 <p><span style>In order to stop him from continuing to harass her like that, Ji Yunshu resigned herself and answered him. “Yes, this humble one is praising your Highness. Can we go now?”</span><span style>“No.”</span><span style>His rebuttal made her cease her steps and turn around! She was flabbergasted. She leaned on the side, and her bright eyes directly stared at him with bewilderment. “Exactly what does your Highness want to do?”</span><span style>The corner of Jing Rong’s mouth curled as he jokingly spoke, “I hate it that you don’t praise me enough.”</span><span style>“You-”</span><span style>“This Prince is not only perceptive but understands which people are called talents and that beauty must be cherished.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu’s shoulders trembled. She immediately disregarded him and departed while throwing a few words at him. “Your Highness’ mind is truly unfathomable. This one doesn’t understand it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She was bright, so she clearly understood what he meant! The talent referred to her, and the beauty also meant her!</span><span style>For him to say those words inexplicably only meant one thing - he knew that she was a girl. And yet he didn’t expose her!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu’s mind tensed, but she didn’t dare to slow down her pace. She was afraid to walk next to him and listen to his strange words.</span><span style>By the time they reached the city, the sky had already darkened! On the road, the number of passersby grew more numerous, and many peddlers and hawkers were shouting loudly, boasting about the products they exhibited in front of their stalls.</span><span style>People walked to and fro. Lanterns were hung at every corner. Women and children were enjoying the evening. It was truly a lively place. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu walked into the crowd while Jing Rong followed behind her.</span><span style>She wanted to take another route and part ways with him.</span><span style>How could she expect that </span><i><span style>someone</span></i><span style> would suddenly grab her right hand and strongly pull on her wrist. The strength of the pull made her lose her balance as she staggered a few steps backward, but a hand grabbed her shoulder, stabilizing her.</span><span style>She casted a side glance and met Jing Rong’s gaze.</span><span style>Jing Rong smiled faintly. “I’m a bit hungry and tired. How about we take a break and go eat a bowl of noodles?”</span><span style>She instinctively struggled, but unfortunately, Jing Rong’s grip on her wrist was tight as steel, making all her struggles useless!</span><span style>“Your Highness, release me.”</span><span style>“On such a night, are you planning to go back and sleep in the warmth of your bed?”</span><span style>“Yes.”</span><span style>“I feel it is truly a waste to do so.”</span><i><span style>‘Waste my ass! It’s such a cold night; if I don’t go sleep, do I stay awake for a snowball fight?’</span></i><span style>Without waiting for Ji Yunshu to refuse, he already dragged her to a noodle stand and sat at an empty table.</span><span style>Jing Rong waved. “Boss, give us two bowls of soy sauce noodles with no scallions in one of them.”</span><span style>“Alright!”</span><span style>The boss hung a towel on his shoulder and started preparing their noodles.</span><span style>Jing Rong spoke again. “Boss, when you put the noodles in the water, stir it slowly a few times with your chopsticks. When you take it out, don’t forget to rinse it with cold water. It will be much more fragrant when eaten.”</span><span style>“Alright!”</span><i><span style>‘How skillful! But, hey, Jing Rong, did you grow up on the streets? How can you be so familiar with how street food is made?’</span></i><span style>However, Ji Yunshu asked him something else. “Your Highness, what made you think I don’t eat scallions?”</span><span style>Jing Rong stretched his hand and chose a pair of chopsticks from a small basket. He twirled them and tapped them on the teapot before replying, “Last time at the Zhou Mansion, when you ate your meal you took out all the scallions. Anyone with discerning eyes would be able to notice it.”</span><i><span style>‘Um… he is someone with a discerning eye.’</span></i><span style>“Unfortunately, you are wrong. I don’t dislike scallions.”</span><span style>“Huh? Was I wrong? How come?” Jing Rong became curious. How could he be wrong, he clearly saw Ji Yunshu remove all the scallions!</span><span style>At this moment, Ji Yunshu smiled. She picked a pair of chopsticks and tapped on the teapot. “Your Highness, do you remember what dish I took out the scallions from?”</span><span style>Jing Rong slightly squinted as he pondered. His eyes suddenly brightened. “The fried fish.”</span><span style>“Your memory is really good. Then, does your Highness know that by adding scallion to fried fish, the fishy smell from the fish will be absorbed by it? Although I am used to the bloody stench of corpses, it doesn’t mean that I like the smell of fish as both have different odors. Fish has a more pungent scent which could make the mind uncomfortable, while the smell of blood is dense but doesn’t emit a greasy smell. If you get used to the odor, it’s quite a refreshing scent.”</span><i><span style>Clatter!</span></i><span style>When Ji Yunshu was done talking, the sound of a soup ladle being dropped could be heard behind her.</span><span style>The boss’ face could be seen twitching as Ji Yunshu’s words scared and startled him, no less.</span><span style>The boss immediately forced a smile as he gave them their orders. “T-two… Customers enjoy…” His voice quivered as he spoke.</span><span style>Today he encountered incredibly strange customers who had unique tastes!</span><span style>The boss put down the bowls and hurriedly distanced himself from them.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu couldn’t help but laugh. She had completely forgotten how she felt annoyed at Jing Rong for dragging her here.</span><span style>Her eyebrows were lowered as she laughed, the sight etched into Jing Rong’s eyes.</span><span style>He wondered how Ji Yunshu would look if she changed into women’s clothing and how beautiful she would look with her hair falling on her shoulders! He became distracted but immediately pulled himself back to reality.</span><span style>He declared, “Hurry and eat or it will turn cold.”</span><span style>He picked up his chopsticks and dug in, eating with relish.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu watched him before she followed suit.</span><span style>She only ate one mouthful before stopping. As for Jing Rong, he had engulfed everything in his bowl by moving his chopsticks a few times. When he was done, he raised his head and saw that her bowl was barely eaten from. “You’re not eating?”</span><span style>“I don’t feel like eating.”</span><span style>“Don’t waste food.” The words barely fell, but Jing Rong had already taken her bowl.</span><span style>“Don’t-” Ji Yunshu became shocked.</span><span style>It was too late. He had already dipped his chopsticks in her bowl and started eating with gusto.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that instant, his action shocked her like being hit by lightning on a clear day. She gaped at him for a long time.</span><span style>After he was done eating, he was extremely delighted when he saw her shocked expression. The corner of his mouth curved into a smile. He stretched his fingers and pulled her chin up, closing her mouth.</span><span style>“Teacher Ji, what made you so shocked? This Prince won’t ignore you.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu was at loss of words.</span><span style>“That’s good. I’m full, so let’s go.” Jing Rong took out his money and put it on the table. Then, he dragged Ji Yunshu away by hand, leaving the noodle stand and merging into the crowd.</span><span style>When she looked at Jing Rong holding her hand, it always made her feel very uncomfortable.</span><span style>She waved her arm and freed herself as her long sleeves flipped in the air. She retracted her hand inside her sleeves and held both of her hands tightly to avoid Jing Rong from grabbing either of them.</span><span style>“It’s getting late. This humble one will leave first.” Ji Yunshu resumed showing an indifferent expression as she spoke. She quickly left after bypassing Jing Rong.</span><span style>Jing Rong stood at the same place for a moment, watching his now empty hand as he felt the lingering soft feeling. Not long after, he turned around and chased after her.</span></p>
