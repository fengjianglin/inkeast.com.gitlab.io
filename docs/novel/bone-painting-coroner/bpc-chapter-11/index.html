 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The county magistrate looked like a fearful principal offender, so Ji Yunshu gripped the sandalwood box tighter under her arm and sent him a puzzled look.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Milord, Miss Zhou will be buried in four hours. If we want to re-investigate the case later, we will need to dig the coffin back out. It would be an interminable delay, and the investigation will be quite inconvenienced. I’m certain milord can understand the logic.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magistrate rubbed his hands together while clicking his tongue several times. His brows knitted from anxiety. “Of course I understand, but…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Someone is waiting for you in the yamen! How about we go the yamen first, then wait a bit before going to Zhou Mansion? We can certainly catch up to the funeral procession before Miss Zhou is buried.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>He stared at her with an almost desperate look. His heart beat nervously as he waited for her answer.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu raised an eyebrow and asked, “Could it be that there is also another dead person at the yamen?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, no, no! Someone is looking for you. It’s the young master that your father followed to East Suburbs yesterday. He came to the yamen for you early today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Has the coroner finished the autopsy of the five corpses?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s stop delaying! My good Yunshu, hurry and follow me to the yamen. The matter with the Zhou family can wait.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>His patience at an ended, Liu Qingping didn’t allow Ji Yunshu to speak another word as he dragged her to the yamen as if his butt was on fire. Meanwhile, Jing Rong was about done with his cup of tea. He lifted his eyes just in time to see the county magistrate rush in, dragging a surprised Ji Yunshu with him. The county magistrate tried to speak, but just panted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unexpectedly, Ji Yunshu was not out of breath, nor was her heart beating erratically. She stood with a serene face, looking straight at Jing Rong, who was sitting on a chair made out of pear wood. Yesterday, in the pitch black darkness, it had been difficult to see his appearance in detail, But the daylight revealed his sword-like eyebrows with bright eyes, outlined by peach blossom eyes. His face was dyed with treacherousness and icy arrogance. It was obvious that he showed a few hints of interest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Their eyes locked together. From the beginning, Jing Rong had been studying Ji Yunshu, just as she was him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He observed Ji Yunshu’s white and slightly rosy clean face. He didn’t know if it was because of the jog just now or the blowing wind, but her pair of deep eyes were even more full of vitality. So to say… When he looked at that person, he didn’t feel any disdain at all!</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magistrate bent at the waist with haste. “Prince Rong, this official has brought you the person.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Prince Rong?’</span></i><span style> Ji Yunshu became absent-minded. Indeed, a person who could make her evil father shake his tail like a dog was either his mother or an influential character, but never a nobody!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong gave him a deep look before waving his hand, gesturing for Liu Qingping to withdraw to the side. Then, he faced Ji Yunshu and asked, “Teacher Ji, did you eat well today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I ate very well!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, did you sleep well yesterday?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This humble self did not sleep a wink the whole night.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How so?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>She had to kneel the whole night, so of course she didn’t sleep well. But how could she talk about that?! Ji Yunshu frowned and asked in reply, “Prince Rong, are you living next to the sea?” In other words, mind your own business!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fortunately, Jing Rong didn’t quite understand. Instead, he seriously tried to analyze the meaning behind her question. “I live in Rong Estate within the capital. It’s nowhere near the sea. Teacher Ji, could it be that you’re confused from the lack of sleep?”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘You’re the confused one! Your whole family is confused!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu raised her eyes. “Since your highness is searching for me, I believe it isn’t to simply ask if I had eaten yet or to chat with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course not.” Jing Rong replied sternly and went to the main subject. “The coroner has examined the corpse and confirmed that they died from poisoning. The verdict was just as you said.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t seem surprised as she asked, “Therefore…?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Therefore, I want to invite Teacher Ji for a trip to the memorial hall. Help me do another detailed examination and determine whether or not there is something else!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have the corpses been dissected?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Their guts are all visible!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are the bones visible?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“As clear as day. That’s the reason why I ask whether or not Teacher Ji has already eaten. It is in order to avoid any unwanted reactions when you see the corpses.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Unwanted reaction? Was he afraid that she would vomit? How funny! What manner of things had she, Ju Yunshu, not yet seen? Not to mention dissected corpses dripping with blood, she had even touched many rotten corpses filled with maggots.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The case of Zhou family’s young miss or Prince Rong’s case, which one to investigate first? Would this make things difficult for the magistrate?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong took a guess, “Is there another case?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The county magistrate replied without delay, “Prince Rong, two days ago, there was a homicide case. The victim is a young lady from a wealthy household. The family wants to bury her quickly. If we don’t investigate now, I’m afraid it would be too late.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s expression was dignified. After much deliberation, he said to Ji Yunshu, “My matter is not urgent. Handle that case first and then come earnestly help me, so to avoid you getting distracted.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Oh! Such a good person!</span></p>
