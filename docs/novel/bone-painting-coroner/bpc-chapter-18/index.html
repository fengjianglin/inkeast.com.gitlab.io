 <p><span style>“What does your Highness mean by that?” Ji Yunshu replied with a question of her own.</span><span style>“If you didn’t discover anything, then why do you want to stay here?” Jing Rong completely saw through her. He continued, “You should believe in me. Maybe I can be your assistant.”</span><span style>Although Jing Rong was not someone Ji Yunshu was fond of, she did need an assistant at the moment.</span><span style>Since it was like that, she might as well be content with this one. “Since your Highness has spoken and this was exactly what I needed, I would like to request your Highness to help me with something.”</span><span style>“Explain yourself.”</span><span style>“There is no rush. Let’s wait until tonight to talk.” She raised her eyebrows and left him hanging. She turned her attention to the food in front of her, picking up her bowl and chopsticks. “Even though the Zhou family is in mourning, they still sent us such a lavish meal. Their treatment of guests is pretty good.”</span><span style>Jing Rong, who was sitting next to her, was making a face. He lightly stated, “I’m not hungry.”</span><span style>Without hurrying, Ji Yunshu put a piece of meat in her mouth before she added, “Well, the food here can’t be compared with the fine delicacies at the Rong Estate. It’s inevitable that your Highness is not used to the taste.”</span><span style>When her words came out, Jing Rong ‘s expression sank.</span><span style>“This prince has eaten wild herbs in the mountains. I’m afraid that I have experienced such meals more often than Teacher Ji has eaten salt.”</span><span style>“Your Highness really can joke.”</span><span style>He was a prince. Who would believe that he regularly ate mountain herbs?</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s face was grim as he glared at her, “The Great Lin dynasty encompasses Nanjiang to the south and Beiliang to the north. I’ve passed through more than a hundred and eight regions as I made my way from the south to the north. I’ve stayed in small villages deep in the mountains and remote shacks in the middle of nowhere. If everywhere I went there were delicacies, would there be a need for the people of our Great Lin dynasty to starve or freeze to death?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu’s hand froze as he recaptured her attention. She looked at him curiously. “You travelled to so many places?”</span><span style>“This is not the main point.”</span><span style>“Then, what’s the main point?”</span><span style>Jing Rong glared at her. “All of this was mainly to inform you that I am not picky!”</span><span style>How embarrassing! </span><i><span style>‘If you don’t want to eat then don’t eat.’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu was hungry, so she continued to eat her meal with relish.</span><span style>Jing Rong’s mutters floated into her ears. “Thoughtless, he can actually still eat so soon after.”</span><span style>Yeah! Who in the world would be in the mood to eat a good meal less than two hours after examining a corpse? Only Ji Yunshu would be in the mood.</span><span style>After eating her fill, she rested until the sky gradually turned dark.</span><span style>“Your Highness, didn’t you want to help me? Let’s go.”</span><span style>As soon as she spoke, she got to her feet and walked outside.</span><span style>Jing Rong was puzzled, but he still followed after her.</span><span style>Not too long after, they reached their destination: the attic where Miss Zhou had apparently fallen from. There were still several lanterns hung on the corner, illuminating the vicinity, giving the place a gentle and charming view. </span><span style>Ji Yunshu had always loved lanterns of ancient times, thus she spent some time admiring them. She recovered her mind only after Jing Rong patted her.</span><span style>“Are we coming here to admire lanterns?”</span><span style>“It’s to investigate the case.”</span><span style>Brought back to earth, she retracted her gaze from the lanterns.</span><span style>Jing Rong appeared to guess her intention, so he said, “Are you suspecting that there was someone hiding in the attic at the time of the victim’s fall?”</span><span style>“It looks like your Highness is very sharp.”</span><span style>“Of course.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu did not explain further and walked around the attic.</span><span style>The attic was, in fact, a tall but not big pavilion. There were no partitioned rooms inside, instead filled with mahogany railings and benches. If there was someone hidden inside the attic, it would be obvious to see.</span><span style>Apart from the furniture, there was nothing else.</span><span style>No matter how much Yunshu looked, she could not find a place that could hide anyone.</span><span style>Lost in her thoughts, she absentmindedly turned around and knocked her forehead against a sturdy chest. The collision caused her a lot of pain!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu subconsciously put her hand to her forehead and frowned. She stayed silent but glared at Jing Rong who was rubbing his chest, feeling dissatisfied.</span><span style>“Why did you suddenly turn around without a warning? My chest is not a pillow. If you bump into it like that it would break.”</span><span style>“Then why was your Highness standing behind me without a sound?”</span><span style>Jing Rong frowned. “Are you saying that I need to tell you where I want to go?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu clamped her mouth. </span><i><span style>‘Then, you’re telling me that I should schedule with you when I’m going to turn around?’ </span></i><span style>Of course, she could not speak those words aloud, but it did not douse the flames of anger burning in her heart. He was a prince and whatever he said was reasonable. As for her, she was just an insignificant painter. How could she dare to argue with him?</span><span style>She might as well just let it be...</span><span style>“Everything is my fault!”</span><span style>She did not feel like arguing, so she moved around him and was about to walk in another direction.</span></p>
 <p><span style>But, who knew that as soon as she passed by him, two big hands would seize her waist and pull her back. She lost her balance, directly slamming into Jing Rong’s chest. By the time her body fell, his hands were tightly holding her waist. Thus, for all intents and purposes, she’d fallen into his embrace!</span><span style>Two grown “men” were holding onto each other in such a way… Under the light breeze, the lanterns gently swayed while the light flickered, projecting their tall and short shadows on the wooden floor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Such a beautiful scene to behold!</span></p>

 <p>Fufufu~ If you think that Ji Yunshu's interaction with Jing Rong makes you squeal, wait until a certain character is introduced. You will have diabetes when reading their interactions.</p>
