 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Nights in January often threatened to rain, teased by icy winds. But in stark contrast to the chill in the air, several lanterns hung under the corner of the roof of the anteroom, radiating warmth and light.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Quickly afterwards, Luan’er stealthily arrived to deliver a blanket and a small furnace.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Master clearly knew that Miss’ health is not good, but he still punished you to kneel all night. Isn’t this just wanting your life?!” Luan’er started to cry tearfully.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why are you such a crybaby?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu folded her body around the small furnace. Gradually, her body warmed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luan’er wiped her tears. “Miss, it’s because you’re like this, neither fighting nor arguing, that people keep bullying you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Who said that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Luan’er is not blind. I can see it, like last time, Eldest Miss pulled out your beloved Pu tree and planted it in her courtyard. How about the other day, when Fourth Miss cut all your winter clothes to pieces? What’s more, Second Young Master broke Master’s colored glass lamp but framed you for it. But did you say anything? Miss, your heart is too benevolent. However, no one tried to look into the matter or appreciate your kindness. You are simply stubbing your toes while moving stones. The only one hurt in the end is you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luan’er clenched her fist in anger.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This girl… How many times did I say not to blabber too much; the walls here have ears.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite Ji Yunshu reprimanding Luan’er, she knew within her heart that Luan’er was only looking out for her well-being.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luan’er lowered her head, feeling completely wronged!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since she occupied this body, Ji Yunshu’s temper had become more or less similar to the original, simple and elegant. Both had been flexible and soft, but steady in the face of hardship.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Besides, she was also tired of fighting and scheming, mutual deception, and outwitting others. Thus, as long as the situation was bearable, she would absolutely not quarrel with people.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps because of the contradictory nature within humans, the more she was obedient, the more the other misses and young masters loved to find trouble with her. It happened once every three days for trivial matters and every once in awhile for major trouble. They were as punctual as her menstruation!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Early morning.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu was done with her punishment; and thus, Luan’er helped her get up. She intended to return to her courtyard to rest, but she barely left the west side room when she ran into Ji Muqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Muqing wore an outer garment made of snow-white brocade with purple patterns, paired with gold embroidered shoes. Her hair was decorated with gold and silver hairpins. A top-grade white water pearl hung around her neck, while a silver bracelet highlighted her shapely wrist. She was adorned from head to toe in bright jewelry and precious pearls, with every item being near priceless.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Right behind her trailed two overbearing maidservants named Shui’er and Luo’er.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The Ji family’s Eldest Miss, Ji Muqing, always had that kind of bearing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What? Did you go fiddle with those unclean things again?” Her tone was dripping with sarcasm, and the corner of her mouth was pulled into a condescending smile.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu narrowed her eyes. She had no plans to pay attention to her half-sister. She continued to walk forward, intending to leave. However, Ji Muqing grabbed her wrist and discreetly squeezed… hard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How rude! Are you mute?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu kept her voice neutral, “Yesterday, little sister’s hands touched corpses, and I have yet to find the time to wash them. Big sister doesn’t mind?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“WHAT?” Ji Muqing rapidly released Ji Yunshu’s wrist in a burst of fear. Then she used a handkerchief and fiercely wiped her hand while her mouth cursed, “Unlucky, unlucky! So early in the morning and I was contaminated by such wretched luck.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon seeing this, Luan’er interjected, “Eldest Miss, yesterday, Third Miss kneeled all night as punishment, please don’t make things difficult…”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Paf!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Muqing didn’t even look in Luan’er’s direction before slapping her. “A lowly maidservant has what qualifications to speak to me.” As the words fell, Muqing glared at Ji Yunshu. “Indeed, such a master would raise that kind of dog. Servants, take this cheap maidservant and throw her in the firewood shed. Teach her a good lesson for me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>This was clearly Ji Muqing venting her anger on Luan’er!</span></p>
 <p><span style>After all, even nominally, Ji Yunshu was Ji Muqing’s little sister. She could verbally abuse her, but she could not hit her. But Luan’er, she was merely a maidservant who could be injured or even beaten to death without consequence.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a few taels of silver, there was a dime a dozen to pick from!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shui’er and Luo’er, who were behind Muqing, immediately started to comply. They approached Luan’er, intending to drag her away.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Usually when Ji Yunshu gets mistreated, she would let it go. But venting anger on Luan’er? That was out of question. Yunshu immediately stepped in front of Luan’er. She raised her brows and stared at Ji Muqing.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That look caused Ji Muqing’s entire body to quiver.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big sister, getting angry so early in the morning will be bad for your body. It would be better to just forget it. Later, I will teach Luan’er.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This little servant always likes to interrupt people. If it spreads outside, people will think that all our maidservants are vulgar. It won’t do if I don’t properly discipline her today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The unspoken implication was, of course, that Ji Yunshu was “vulgar”.</span></p>
 <p><span style>That woman, Ji Muqing, was really a top-notch primate!</span></p>
