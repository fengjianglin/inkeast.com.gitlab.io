 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The big hall seemed to be filled with thunderous clouds and gunpowder, and every weapon seemed to be pointed straight at Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>Ji Wanxin’s face was filled with worry as she stood fretfully at the side. She used her handkerchief to cover her mouth as she coughed several times before speaking, “Grandmother, Father, don’t misunderstand Yunshu. At the time, I was there too. Lingzhi fell on her own.” When she head this, Ji Muqing was not pleased. Her phoenix eyes snapped over to her sister.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wanxin, we all know that you and Yunshu are very close, but you can’t just protect her like this. She may have injured Lingzhi’s hand today, but what if one day she breaks it instead? At that time, would you still protect her?” Ji Muqing’s voice was dripping with poisonous sarcasm like usual.</span><span style>“I speak the truth.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then you mean to say that Lingzhi lied?” Ji Muqing lifted a brow. When those words came out, Ji Lingzhi immediately defended herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t lie. Third Sister definitely pushed me. Second Sister, you clearly saw her do so, why are you speaking out for her and not for me?” Ji Lingzhi raised her voice as she refuted Ji Wanxin’s words.</span><span style>Saying so, she once again lifted those pitiful hands that were bandaged up to the point they resembled a pair of dumplings, her eyes filling with tears as she stared at her father. She cried out, “Father, you have to help me teach Third Sister a lesson. She was the one who pushed me. My hands still hurt so badly.”</span><span style>Ji Shuhan snorted. His hand lifted and slammed on the table once again, questioning Ji Yunshu, “Lingzhi is your younger sister. Even if you hate me for marrying you off to the Wei family, you shouldn’t have taken it out on her.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu simply smiled. “Since father and grandmother have judged that I pushed Lingzhi, nothing I say will change anything.”</span><span style>“You still dare to talk back to me.”</span><span style>“Your daughter simply does not feel motivated to debate.”</span><span style>Her retort caused Ji Shuhan to be so angered that a green vein bulged on his forehead as he pointed at her. “I must have committed some horrendous crime to have such a vicious creature like you as my child. Just look at yourself! Clothed in men’s wear on a daily basis, you’re simply a disgrace to my Ji family. Since you’re so recalcitrant, don’t blame me for being a cruel father. Guards, discipline her using the family laws.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Family laws?! Didn’t you people refuse to acknowledge me as a Ji? But now you want to use the family laws on me?!’</span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu smiled in derision, a glint of stubbornness in her eyes as she squarely met her father’s gaze. It didn’t hold the slightest intention to beg for mercy, and that struck Ji Shuhan’s nerves, enraging him further.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He yelled at a servant who was at the side. “Hurry and bring me my whip.”</span><span style>The servant’s face twitched as he obeyed. He hurriedly retrieved a horsewhip, its handle made of golden brocade and jade. That whip was an object bestowed upon the Ji family by the Emperor himself. Ji Shuhan had always treasured it and used it as the tool of punishment when it came to applying the family laws.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu had heard Luan’er speak of it before. When the original Ji Yunshu accidentally broke a normal teapot in Ji Shuhan’s study, she’d suffered three lashes of this whip as a punishment. As a result, she had fallen into a coma for a few days! Now that Ji Shuhan had taken out the whip again, she might not suffer just three lashes but ten!</span><span style>Seeing this, Ji Wanxin hurriedly stepped forward. “Father, you can’t. That whip can kill people.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If anyone gets in my way, they’ll be whipped along with her.” Ji Shuhan had made up his mind!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Wanxin’s pleas having gone unheard, she could only turn and pull on Ji Yunshu instead and attempt to persuade her, “Yunshu, hurry and admit your wrongs to father. You can’t take a lashing from that whip.” She only got a ridicule-filled smile in response. The original Ji Yunshu could survive three lashes, what was she afraid of?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since your mind is set on lashing me, this matter is already settled. Fine then, I shall receive the ‘family laws’.” Having spoken thus, she raised the pan of her robe and knelt!</span><span style>Clothed in light blue robes, her body ramrod straight, she surprisingly gave off quite the manly aura!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Shuhan had already raised the whip. With clenched jaws, he swung down with all his might.</span><span style>‘PAH!’</span><span style>One lash struck!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her shoulders and back exploded in pain. A pain so intense, it drilled into her heart as her ears and mind filled with a buzzing noise. Despite the pain, Ji Yunshu’s body remained straightened. She had to keep her pride, her character unyielding!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Then another lash descended!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her body couldn’t help but move forward with the force of the blow. Both hands were pressed on the floor in support, then clenched into a fist. Her eyes were bloodshot yet she stubbornly bit her lips, dead set on not uttering the slightest noise.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The whip landed on her body, one lash followed after another in quick succession accompanied by the sound of a whip lacerating flesh and skin. The sound echoed through the Ji Mansion.</span><span style>At the end of it, Ji Yunshu’s body had completely collapsed on the floor. Her back was now marred with bloody whiplashes. It was an utterly terrifying sight!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even after being beaten to within an inch of her life, Ji Yunshu had refused to plead for mercy. Her lips had been bitten to the point blood was freely flowing, yet she wasn’t willing to scream out her pain.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Finally, she couldn’t take it anymore and fainted dead away.</span><span style>She didn’t remember how she was brought back to her courtyard, she could only vaguely hear sounds of sobbing. </span><i><span style>‘It must have been Luan’er!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>When she woke up, it was already the afternoon of the next day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lying on the bed, even a slight movement would cause her entire body to hurt!</span></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Luan’er carried some hot medicinal decoction into the room. Seeing that Ji Yunshu wanted to get up, Luan’er hurried to her side.</span><span style>“Miss, don’t get up. Please lie back.” Her eyes were brimming with tears!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu could barely move anyways, so she might as well continue lying on her bed. “I won’t die.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss, it’s all my fault. I’m too useless, I can’t even protect you and caused you to suffer so much suffering.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Silly girl. Look, I’m perfectly fine.” Her face was clearly extremely pale and her gaze lacked energy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Luan’er cried for quite a bit more before wiping away at her tears.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu went back to sleep soon after drinking the medicine. She was stuck in bed for two whole days. During this time, only Ji Wanxin visited her to see how she was doing. The rest of the Ji family were probably eager to see her die.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During these two days, confined to bed, Ji Yunshu read through </span><i><span style>The Lin Capital Case</span></i><span style>.</span></p>
 <p><span style>On the third day, she had recuperated quite well. Ignoring Luan’er’s advice, she got out of bed, changed into men’s wear and tied up her hair again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she stepped into her courtyard, she noticed that it was completely empty. All those plants of hers were gone.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She left Ji Mansion and made for the Grand Canal Manor.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because of her injuries, she walked slower than usual.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she walked past a jewelry shop, she saw that the inside was packed with people who were all whispering while pointing at something.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At first, she hadn’t planned on getting involved, but she suddenly heard Wei Yi’s voice, clear as day.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It wasn’t me! I didn’t break your jade pendant! It really wasn’t me!” His voice was filled with panic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu halted in her tracks. Making her way to the front of the crowd, she saw Wei Yi standing there like an idiot while waving his hands.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shopkeeper of the jewelry shop had grabbed onto his hand, while his other hand was holding onto two pieces of broken jade.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You broke my jade pendant so you have to compensate me. 100 taels. Not one less.” The shopkeeper was very aggressive, he even went so far as to hit Wei Yi.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Yi blocked with one hand while furiously denying it, “I didn’t touch your jade pendant, it really wasn’t me.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Just now you said you wanted to have a look, but it dropped on the floor right after you took it.”</span><span style>“But it wasn’t me…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu’s brows furrowed. She shook her head as she stepped in.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“May I have a look at this jade pendant?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Yi turned his head. Seeing that it was her, he became excited and called out, “Big Brother.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu ignored him. She plucked the jade pendant out of the shopkeeper’s hand and closely examined it before facing the shopkeeper once again. She asked him, “Tell me, was this jade pendant just broken?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The shopkeeper nodded his head. “Of course.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then let me ask you another question. Was this jade always kept inside a box in this shop?”</span><span style>“Of course. This is a new item, and was very expensive. But now, this idiot broke it.” The shopkeeper was just as angry as before.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu’s face sunk as she rebuked him. “You are lying.”</span></p>
