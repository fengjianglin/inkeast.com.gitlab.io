 <p><span style>Their ambiguous posture greatly stirred the implicated pair. Their eyes met; but while one of them had an evil teasing smile, the other had a shocked and embarrassed expression.</span><span style>Naturally, the latter was Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>Jing Rong, who was tightly holding onto Ji Yunshu, intentionally rubbed his hand on her waist. The sensation caused Ji Yunshu’s whole body to turn soft, and she could not help but lower her star-like eyes. Fortunately, the surrounding lights were a dim pink, which concealed the blush that had suddenly crept onto her face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s eyes encompassed her tightly closed lips. </span><i><span style>‘This young scholar is really charming!’</span></i><span style>A desire to tease Ji Yunshu rose in the depths of his heart. He spoke, “Teacher’s waist is very thin. If all the lanterns in the attic were extinguished, I would be under the impression that I was holding a woman.”</span><span style>His words snapped Ji Yunshu back to reality. She raised her arms, causing her sleeves to wave and used all her strength to push Jing Rong away, freeing herself from his restraints.</span><span style>“Your Highness, please act with propriety!”</span><span style>The bashful Ji Yunshu turned angry in an instant!</span><span style>However, Jing Rong’s face didn’t even change colors. “In the quiet of a cold winter night… Am I not allowed to joke?”</span><i><span style>‘Loathsome, shameless!’</span></i><span style>“Your Highness, shouldn’t joking have its limit? For two men to hold each other… If people were to see… You might be shameless, but this humble one’s face is thin.” Ji Yunshu’s tone was terrible.</span><span style>Realizing that hugging her had seriously provoked her ire, Jing Rong frowned, but soon revealed a satisfied expression. “At first, I thought that Teacher Ji was taciturn and dull, cold like a frozen pine.” Then, he lowered his head closer to Ji Yunshu’s face and showed a roguish smile. “But it seems Teacher Ji can also get angry. </span><i><span style>Ah</span></i><span style>, how wonderful!”</span><i><span style>‘Wonderful your sister!’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu’s freezing eyes speared him. Then, she stifled the burning anger in her heart and slumped her shoulders. “Prince Rong, it’s getting late, and how can we face the yet to be buried Miss Zhou if we keep bickering here?”</span><span style>“That’s true! We still have an important matter to deal with.” Prince Rong snapped back to reality and nodded.</span><span style>“Your Highness offered your help earlier, so I’ll have to trouble you to stay in this attic. I’ll go down and in the meantime, can you try to find a place to hide? So long as you wouldn’t be seen by me, it would be good.”</span><span style>“Are you trying to make things difficult to me? There’s no place for someone to hide here.” Jing Rong refuted.</span><i><span style>‘This young scholar shouldn’t be using this to take revenge, right?’</span></i><span style>However, Ji Yunshu had already gone downstairs. Without turning her head, she spoke, “That’s your Highness’ problem. Please use your brain.” Her voice gradually became distant as she slipped down the stairs.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu walked to the back of the garden where quite a distance separated her from the attic, standing at the same place Qiaoxin had on that fateful day.</span><span style>She chose a location, then lifted her eyes towards the attic, but the place was empty. Jing Rong was nowhere to be seen.</span><span style>She decided to move to the other end of the garden, but like before, Jing Rong’s figure could not be seen!</span><span style>How puzzling! Where could that crafty deity have hidden? As soon as she thought of it, she saw Jing Rong leaping down from the attic. He steadily landed in front of her.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu only batted her eyelids while calmly looking at him. She inquired, “Your Highness, where did you hide?”</span><span style>“You’re such an intelligent person, can’t you guess?”</span><span style>“I can’t guess.”</span><span style>Jing Rong lost his interest and pointed to the roof. “This kind of triangular shaped roof has a protrusion which can hide a person. If someone hid up there, no matter where people stood below they won’t be able to see that person.”</span><span style>The sudden realization hit Ji Yunshu!</span></p>
 <p><span style>A triangular shaped roof structure was the standard construction layout in ancient times. Unexpectedly, she had overlooked that point.</span><span style>“That means that the murderer knows martial arts.”</span><span style>Even Ji Yunshu was startled at the revelation she was struck with.</span><span style>However, her surprise was completely out of Jing Rong’s expectations. He lowered her eyes towards her and asked, “Why are you surprised?”</span><span style>“I’m surprised…. Because the murderer is not one person.”</span><span style>“How did you come to that conclusion?” Jing Rong revealed a solemn expression.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu pondered a bit before replying. “There were traces of someone lifting Miss Zhou’s arms and dragging her away after her death. Consequently, it caused her shoulders to swell. The shape of the swelling revealed that the person who dragged her in such a way must have little strength. However, to be able to jump up to the roof, only a person with martial arts can accomplish that, and not a weak one at that. Moreover, in the time it took to bring Miss Zhou here, that person is unlikely to have exhausted his strength.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong squinted his long and chilly pair of eyes, and sank into deep thought. </span><i><span style>‘This case is starting to become more and more interesting!’</span></i></p>
