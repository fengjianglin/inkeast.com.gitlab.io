 <p>As the rain got heavier, the palace was veiled in dense mist. Concubine Xiao cooked some snow fungus soup on her own and personally brought it to Fuyang Hall. The Qi Zhen Emperor’s health had gotten way better. He threw the scroll which was submitted only a while ago, furiously onto the ground. A city gate overseer was kneeling on the ground with his back bent to the lowest possible and his forehead touching the ground.</p>
 <p>“How about that person?” Qi Zhen Emperor asked with a stern face.</p>
 <p>The overseer answered, “He’s injured. But fortunately, Young Master Mo was around. Hence, the wound was not too bad.”</p>
 <p>“Not too bad? Someone tried to assassinate a legitimate Prince and you are telling me that it was not too bad? Who is that bold person?”</p>
 <p>“Your subject has no idea. Prince Rong sent a letter to the Capital with high urgency. The moment the letter arrived at the city gate, this humble official promptly submitted it to the palace. According to the Prince’s statement, the criminals have been sent to the Capital and are now awaiting interrogation by the Supreme Court. This humble official only knows this much.” The overseer was shivering as he bowed even lower.</p>
 <p>Anger was painted on the Qi Zhen Emperor’s face. His hands that were resting on the table were now clenched into fists and the veins on his hands popped out clearly! The Qi Zhen Emperor gradually calmed his palpitating chest before he ordered Eunuch Zhang, “Send my words to the Supreme Court. Interrogate the criminals immediately after they arrive at the Capital. I want to find out who is this fearless person who has the guts to ambush the Prince of Da Lin.”</p>
 <p>Eunuch Zhang replied, “Yes!”</p>
 <p>“However, you shall keep this a secret. For now, this news stays within this room.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” The overseer replied with a single word before he resumed being silent while still kneeling on the ground. Shortly later, the Qi Zhen Emperor dismissed him.</p>
 <p>The moment he left the hall, he bumped into Concubine Xiao. “This humble one greets Concubine Xiao.”</p>
 <p>“You may get up, Lord Li.”</p>
 <p>“Thank you, Your Ladyship.”</p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao was curious as she peeked into the hall and asked the overseer, “Lord Li, why did you come to look for Emperor at this hour? Did anything happen?”</p>
 <p>“This…”</p>
 <p>“Is it a secret?”</p>
 <p>The overseer definitely could not speak about it. He bowed. “This humble official only visited to report some issues to the Emperor.”</p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao squinted briefly before dismissing him, “If that’s the case, I will not disturb Lord Li further.”</p>
 <p>“This official will excuse myself.” The Overseer quickly left the palace. <em>There’s poison everywhere inside the palace. One shouldn’t linger here!&nbsp;</em></p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao entered the hall.</p>
 <p>In the hall, Qi Zhen Emperor was supporting his forehead with his hands. His slightly weary face showed no expression and his eyes were gently shut. Faint white smoke was drifting out from the burner beside him. He looked nothing like his exasperated self a while ago. Concubine Xiao made a bow and greeted, “This humble concubine greets Emperor.”</p>
 <p><em>No reply!</em>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao continued, “This humble concubine talked to the kitchen recently. They said that Emperor has lost your appetite and has not eaten enough. This humble concubine decided to cook a bowl of snow fungus soup and bring it here personally.” She handed him the bowl as she spoke and sat down beside Qi Zhen Emperor. Recognizing the smell, Qi Zhen Emperor opened his eyes to look at the bowl of snow fungus soup that was placed in front of him.</p>
 <p>For the past few years, Concubine Xiao had tried many times to reproduce the taste of the snow fungus soup made by the late Empress. However, Concubine Xiao had always failed as the Qi Zheng Emperor had never taken a sip of her cooking.</p>
 <p>However, it was different this time… the Qi Zhen Emperor took the bowl and surprised Concubine Xiao by taking a sip. Following that, he nodded and praised her, “Good. Concubine Xiao’s cooking skill has gotten better.”</p>
 <p><em>What?</em></p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao felt shocked yet surprised. Qi Zhen Emperor had never praised her cooking before. She teared up, “If Emperor likes it, this humble concubine will make it for Emperor every day.”</p>
 <p>“You don’t have to wear yourself out. Due to my overwhelming workload recently, I have many scrolls to looked at. That is why I don’t have much appetite. I appreciate Concubine Xiao’s effort.”</p>
 <p>“That’s what this humble concubine is supposed to do.” She smiled as she massaged the Qi Zhen Emperor’s shoulders and showed her concern by saying, “Emperor has to take care of your health. Remember to take a good rest. You’re the Emperor of Da Lin and all our people depend on you.”</p>
 <p>“I know.” Qi Zhen Emperor took another mouthful of the snow fungus soup.</p>
 <p>Seeing that the Qi Zhen Emperor was in a good mood, Concubine Xiao shifted her eyes and said slyly, “Yi’er resembles Emperor a lot. He spends all his day on the matters of the Royal Court and neglects his personal health. Anyway, Yi’er is no longer young. Even though he has a few concubines in his residence, but the position of his first wife is still vacant. This humble concubine thinks it may be the right time to assign a first wife for Yi’er so that they can inherit the legacy of the empire in the future!”</p>
 <p>The Qi Zhen Emperor did not have much reaction after he heard her words. After a brief silence, he replied, “I will deliberate on this issue.”</p>
 <p>“Since Emperor is going to ponder on this issue, can this concubine suggest a candidate?”</p>
 <p>“Who?”</p>
 <p>“Ji Muqing, the daughter of the Ji Family.”</p>
 <p>The moment she spoke Ji Muqing’s name, the Qi Zhen Emperor’s expression changed immediately. He repeated himself, “I’ll take your suggestion into consideration.” Concubine Xiao decided it was better for her to end the conversation.</p>
 <p>Once she left Fuyang Hall and returned to her residence, she immediately ordered the eunuch, “Bring Prince Yi to my residence.”</p>
 <p>“Yes!” The eunuch immediately left to carry out his task.</p>
 <p>Very quickly, Jing Yi arrived in his official robes. There was a eunuch running along by his side, covering him from the rain with an umbrella. However, the small umbrella could not block the heavy, slanting rain. In a blink of an eye, the bottom of Jing Yi’s robes and his shoes were all wet. Many small water droplets decorated his good-looking face. As he entered the residence, he wiped the water droplets off with his sleeve. Concubine Xiao promptly ordered her servant to prepare a bowl of ginger tea for Jing Yi.</p>
 <p>Jing Yi asked, “Imperial Mother has something important to say?”</p>
 <p>“I think so.”</p>
 <p>“Regarding Jing Rong?”</p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao frowned as she dismissed all the eunuchs and maids in her residence. She said with extreme caution, “Before this, I met Lord Li, the city gate overseer, outside Fuyang Hall. He has never visited the palace without anything of high importance, so it is unlikely for him to visit the palace for no reason today. I questioned him when I bumped into him and he stuttered but did not spill a word. I believe it might be something very significant, hence, I summoned you to my residence to inform you about it. I hope that you can find out what happened. You can also prepare yourself if there is something big happening.”</p>
 <p>Jing Yi fell into thought. He gently hung the teacup on his finger and said, “Lord Li is the city gate overseer and he visited the palace? Could it be… regarding the assassination of Jing Rong that was under my order?”</p>
 <p>“It’s highly possible.”</p>
 <p>“What did Imperial Father say?”</p>
 <p>“Your Imperial Father did not say anything. But, from what I noticed when I spoke to Lord Li, your Imperial Father seems to have forbidden him from speaking about it.”</p>
 <p>Jing Yi squinted as he remained quiet for a while, then wondered, “Did Jing Rong send a letter to the city gate? And then Lord Li personally delivered the letter to the palace? Then, he must have brought the news about the assassination in Anfu to the palace. If that is the case, Imperial Father will definitely inform the Supreme Court. From what I see, we should not speak to Lord Li. Instead, we should ask the Supreme Court Chancellor.”</p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao agreed. She nodded and said, “The Supreme Court Chancellor works for you. If there are any orders from your Imperial Father, the Chancellor will definitely take the initiative and send the news to you.”</p>
 <p>“Yes. Your son will look deeper into this.”</p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao pondered before she spoke again, “Oh, yes. I’ve spoken to your Imperial Father about your marriage and conveniently brought up the name of the Ji Family’s daughter. Your Imperial Father did not object, but neither did he agree. He said that he needed some time to think about this carefully. Hence, he knows our intention and will give us a reply after he considers.”</p>
 <p>In actual fact, Jing Yi clearly knew that his marriage was nothing but a manoeuvre in the game of thrones. His first wife was supposed to gain power for him, and should also be a major factor for him to succeed the throne. Hence, he had given in to this idea a long time ago! “I’ll follow Imperial Mother’s instructions.”</p>
 <p>“Don’t you worry. Your Imperial Mother will lead you to the throne. You’ll have to marry Ji Muqing no matter what happens, then gain the power of the Ji Brothers.” Concubine Xiao’s delicate face turned ferocious, showing how much she craved for the power.</p>
 <p>Comparatively, Jing Yi appeared calm. He did not bother to think about his marriage at the moment, but his mind was on the visit of the city gate overseer. There was no sign of the rain stopping as it only got heavier. Concubine Xiao intended to make Jing Yi stay for a little longer and leave only after the rain stopped. However, Jing Yi informed Concubine Xiao that he was going to the Supreme Court as the matter could not be delayed. Then, he hastily left Concubine Xiao’s residence.</p>
