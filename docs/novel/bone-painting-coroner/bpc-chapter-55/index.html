 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Ever since leaving Grand Canal Manor, Ji Yunshu hadn’t spoken a word.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her steps got heavier as she felt her strength start to leave her. Her eyelids were also fighting to stay open.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fresh blood oozed from her injury, dying the clothes on her back from their original blue to a darker hue. One couldn’t tell if it was because of the blood or the sweat.</span><span style>Despite her eyesight getting blurrier and her steps getting more unstable, she resisted the urge to cry out in pain and continued forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Night had slowly fallen as they walked. Wei Yi was holding onto a small sky lantern[1. Sky lantern: </span><span style>Sky lantern are also called Kong Ming Lanterns, named after the famous military strategist and inventor Zhu Geliang (Courtesy name Kong Ming) from the Three Kingdoms Era. It is cylindrical and usually made with wax paper, and able to levitate using the same principle as hot air balloons.]</span><span style> made of white paper. He had probably been playing with it too much, as evidenced by the holes pockmarking it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>He was extremely excited as he lifted the lantern while skipping around.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother, look. I found it in the courtyard. Doesn’t it look nice?”</span><i><span style>‘It’s already so broken, what’s so nice to look at!’</span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu ignored him.</span><span style>“I heard my teacher call this a sky lantern. When I was very young my mother would light these lanterns and let them float into the air, lots of them. It looked awesome. Big brother, have you seen that before?”</span><i><span style>‘Nope!&nbsp;</span></i><i><span style>I’ve seen quite a lot of bodies though. Dry corpses, dissected corpses, skeletons… They look quite good when piled up together.’</span></i><span style>But Ji Yunshu didn’t have the energy to reply to him. Her lips were turning whiter as she slowed down a lot. Yet, her back was still as straight as ever.</span><span style>Wei Yi hadn’t noticed that something was wrong. He continued skipping ahead, though at every three steps he would halt to wait for her.</span><span style>After a while, he turned around to face Ji Yunshu and cheekily started walking backward.</span><span style>“Big brother, I can see you if I walk like this.”</span><span style>“Um.”</span><span style>“Big brother, you’re walking very slowly.”</span><span style>“Um.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Big brother, do your feet hurt?”</span><span style>“Um.”</span><span style>Two steps later, the strength in her legs suddenly left her as she blacked out. She suddenly fell to the floor, relying on one leg to support her own weight.</span><span style>Seeing this, Wei Yi couldn’t be bothered about his sky lantern anymore; he tossed it aside and approached Ji Yunshu. He knelt on the ground, his face filled with panic.</span><span style>“Big brother, what’s wrong?”&nbsp;</span><span style>His voice betrayed his fear!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu bit her lips as she heaved lightly. A sheen of cold sweat covered her forehead. With some effort, she lifted her eyes to look at Wei Yi.</span><span style>“Wei Yi, have you carried someone before?” asked Ji Yunshu in an extremely weak voice.</span><span style>He shook his head, nope!</span><span style>“Then if I ask you to carry me, would you be okay?”&nbsp;</span><span style>She was still unwilling to mention the injury on her back.</span><span style>Wei Yi nodded his head furiously! “Okay.” Although his tone was still bright, it contained hints of worry.&nbsp;</span><span style>He had already crouched down in front of Ji Yunshu, his back facing her, saying, “Big brother, come on, I’ll carry you.”</span><span style>The sight of Wei Yi’s back, which looked firm and reliable caused Ji Yunshu to feel warmth despite the coldness of the night.</span></p>
 <p><span style>At that moment, Ji Yunshu’s eyes nearly turned red. </span><i><span style>‘No one has ever been willing to do this for me before!’&nbsp;</span></i><span style>Gritting her teeth, she shakily climbed onto Wei Yi’s back.</span><span style>Wei Yi held onto her legs as he lifted her up without much effort.</span><span style>“Big brother, you’re very light.”</span><span style>Indeed, she was too light. </span><span style>Her head leaned on Wei Yi’s shoulder as she moved her head next to his ear while asking, “Wei Yi, do you know the way?”</span><span style>“I don’t.”</span><span style>“Alright. I’ll guide you. Walk straight for now.”</span><span style>“Okay.”</span><span style>He carried Ji Yunshu as he walked at a speed neither fast nor slow.</span><span style>“Big brother, how about I sing for you? When mother carried me, she would sing.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu’s eyelids slowly shut, though hearing his voice she still quietly acquiesced.</span><span style>Having gotten a reply, Wei Yi smiled. He cleared his throat as he started to sing.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <blockquote>
  <span style>As it were long ago,<p></p><p><span style>Caressed by the gentle wind,</span></p><p><span style>The son from Zhao’s comes home</span></p><p><span style>Carrying with him wholly the beauty of Pu Yang[2. Pu Yang: </span><span style>Name of a Chinese city in Hebei province.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">With a book,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The Servant went forth to greet him,</span></p><p><span style>Him and the languor from his voyage.</span></p></span>
 </blockquote>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>That voice that should have been rough was bestowed gentleness by the song.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t know that Wei Yi could sing so well.&nbsp;</span><span style>She gave a slight smile as she asked weakly, “What’s this song?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mother says it’s called ‘Youth’. When I was small, my mother used to carry me and sing this song to me. But now she won’t carry me anymore. She says I’ve grown up and have to marry and have kids. She says that when I have little Wei Yis then I’ll have to carry them and sing this song to them.”</span><i><span style>‘Silly kid, your mother is really good to you to tell you so much.’</span></i><span style>He added, “Big brother, right now I’m carrying you, so does that mean you’re a little Wei Yi?”</span><span style>Pfft~!</span><i></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘You’re the little Wei Yi! Your whole family is little Wei Yis!’</span></i><i><span style>‘I’m not going to be your wife or have little Wei Yis with you.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>If it hadn’t been for the injury on her back causing her so much pain, she would’ve knocked on his head with her knuckles right now.</span><span style>Wei Yi reached an intersection. She lifted her hand to point towards a direction, “That way.”</span><span style>“Okay,” Wei Yi replied.&nbsp;</span><span style>As he followed Ji Yunshu’s guidance, Wei Yi once again started to hum.</span><span style>In the cold, windy night, a tall silhouette carried a smaller thinner one as it walked down the long, winding road. That scene was quite beautiful.</span></p>
 <p><span style>During the journey, Ji Yunshu had nearly fallen asleep several times due to Wei Yi’s singing.&nbsp;</span><span style>Finally, they reached the entrance to the west courtyard of the Ji Mansion.</span><span style>“You can put me down now,” Ji Yunshu said.</span><span style>Wei Yi carefully placed her down before asking her earnestly, “Big brother, did I sing well?”</span><span style>She nodded as she pushed the door open. Her face was even paler than before.</span><span style>Wei Yi suddenly furrowed his brow as he asked her, “Big brother, are you sick?”</span><span style>“Wei Yi, do you remember the way back home?”</span><span style>“I remember how to go back from here,” answer Wei Yi with a firm tone</span><span style>Ji Yunshu’s leaned against the doorframe using her hands as she took a deep breath. “Then be careful on your way back. If your mother asks you where you went, don’t mention anything about Grand Canal Manor, got it?”</span><span style>“Why?”</span><span style>“No why.”</span><span style>“Oh,” He pursed his lips as he nodded firmly.&nbsp;</span><span style>Suddenly he looked inside, as if he was looking for something. He couldn’t help but mutter, “Big sister should be asleep already.”</span><i><span style>‘How disappointing! Your big sister isn’t asleep! She’s right in front of you!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing his remark, she thought to herself, </span><i><span style>‘This fellow really has taken a liking to me.’</span></i><span style>“Wei Yi, it’s already dark. Hurry and head home.”</span><span style>“Oh. Big brother, when can I find you to play again? I’m always by myself, no one wants to play with me.”</span><span style>‘How pitiful! Even I have a bunch of corpses to play with.’</span><span style>Hence, Ji Yunshu couldn’t help but say, “If you want to look for me, go to the yamen.”</span><span style>Wei Yi was extremely happy upon hearing the answer. “Okay! Then I’ll be leaving now, big brother.”&nbsp;</span><span style>With a wave of his hand and a slight smile, he merrily skipped away!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu couldn’t keep herself upright any longer and fell to the ground, her knee knocked into the doorframe, causing her even more pain.</span><span style>Fortunately, Luan’er just so happened to be leaving the courtyard at this moment. She saw the door wide open and her Young Miss collapsed on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>With a countenance whitened by fear, she hurriedly approached and crouched down, “Miss, you… what’s wrong?”&nbsp;</span><span style>When Luan’er’s hand touched Ji Yunshu’s back, she felt wetness. Lifting her hand, she saw that her hand was actually covered with blood!</span></p>
