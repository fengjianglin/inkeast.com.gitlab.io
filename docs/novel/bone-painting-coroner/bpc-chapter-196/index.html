 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Heroes die under beauty’s hands. Jing Rong had naturally heard the saying. It was often used for emperors but now applied to him.</span><i><span style>‘How amusing!’</span></i><span style> He smiled and mischievously whispered into her ear, “Have you heard of the saying - Even a ghost, having died under a peony, can be amorous!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You rogue!” Ji Yunshu reprimanded. Her hand pressed down hard around 10 centimeters below his shoulders, aiming for his scapula.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong felt his whole left arm lose all strength and sensation. Ji Yunshu took advantage of his weakness and sprung out of his embrace. She withdrew more than three meters until her back pressed against the door frame. Her guard was all the way up as she watched him frown from the pain she had inflicted.</span><span style>“How can a stately prince utter such vulgarity?” Her heart burned with anger.</span><span style>Jing Rong massaged his numb arm, complaining at the same time, “The most vicious heart is that of a married woman. You actually want to cripple me.”</span><span style>“I just pressed your shoulder blade. How is this crippling you?”</span><span style>“Ah?” He strode forward, eyebrow raised. “If you really cripple my arm, you will have to take care of me for the rest of your life.”</span><span style>“Rogue!” Ji Yunshu wanted to run away, but Jing Rong was determined to keep her where she was.</span><span style>Jing Rong rushed toward her and barred her escape route before she could put a foot out of the room. The door banged shut in a single, quick motion</span><i><span style>! </span></i><span style>He caught her again, imprisoning her in his tight embrace. Ji Yunshu couldn’t even budge. The distance of a single finger stood between them. At this distance, she could see only his chest.</span><span style>His manly scent assaulted her nose, causing her heart to beat erratically. She wanted to turn her head away, but couldn’t. Frantic, she shouted, “Bastard, let me go!”</span><span style>“You are the first to dare call me a bastard.”</span><span style>“Don't you think you deserve it with how you're behaving?”</span><span style>Jing Rong suddenly grabb</span><span style>ed her chin and lift it, forcing their eyes to meet. “Fine, then I’ll </span><span style>show you what a real bastard does</span><span style>.</span><span style>”</span><span style>“You—”</span><span style>Her words were swallowed by his forceful kiss. He was taller, so he had to lower his head and body to meet her exquisite, scarlet lips. Although it wasn’t their first kiss, Jing Rong's intensity had not decreased at all; it was like he was venting. Their lips collided, smashing against each, rubbing until they merged together and spreading their passion like wildfire, leaving no gap between them.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu felt her cold lips slowly heating from Jing Rong’s deep and passionate kiss.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Because he craved her too much, he pressed her against the carved door frame forcefully. The low temperature of the wood seeped through her thin clothes and penetrated her hot body; it coursed through her veins and spread to every part of her. The change made it feel like her blood was congealing, turning her numb. She persisted in her struggle against his tyranny. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong soon escalated, one of his hands seized her waist and pressed her small body against him, forcing it to stick to his chest. Ji Yunshu’s body was on fire. She burned and felt herself on the verge of asphyxia. Her hands balled into fists; her eyebrows frowned and she ferociously bit down.</span><span style>“Urgh!</span><span style>The pain of his lips being bitten burst into his mind The taste of blood poured out of his broken lips. Ji Yunshu finally pushed him away. She lifted her sleeve and ferociously wiped her lips. Her eyes were red.</span><span style>Jing Rong wiped the blood off his lips. His mischievous appearance abruptly became solemn. “Do you hate me so much?” he asked, his tone melancholic.</span><span style>“...”</span><span style>“I clearly have a place in your heart, so why don’t you acknowledge it?”</span><span style>“...”</span><span style>“Answer me!” Jing Rong emphasized.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu looked at him with her red eyes. But she couldn’t answer him, her heart stung too much.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her silence stirred hope in his heart. His vicious countenance vanished as the corner of his mouth curled into a smile. “Yunshu, are you admitting that I have long been in your heart?” He half-whispered.</span><i><span style>‘Huh?’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu was caught by surprise. </span><i><span style>‘No! Impossible!’ </span></i><span style>She bit her lips, showing a panic-stricken expression as her heart drummed in her chest and her brain shut down.</span><span style>“No!”</span><span style>She abruptly turned around and fled out of the door, leaving behind a beaming Jing Rong. When he recalled Ji Yunshu’s expression, he became certain that even if it was only a small place, he had taken root in her heart.</span><span style>At that very moment, Lang Po came in and saw Ji Yunshu fleeing from the room. He had some doubts but still entered. He was startled to see Jing Rong's lips in the state they were in. “Your Highness, what happened to your lips?”</span><span style>“Nothing!”</span><span style>“But they're bleeding! Should I summon the physician?”</span><span style>“I said it’s nothing. I just got bitten by a crafty little fox.” He couldn’t help smiling as he spoke. He was simply overflowing with joy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Po had a question mark on his forehead, but after Jing Rong turned and entered his room, he was hit by a sudden realization.</span><i></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Oh my! It is possible that his Highness and Teacher Ji already…’ </span></i><span style>Lang Po smirked, even a rustic man like him also felt shy from imagining the scene.</span><span style>After Ji Yunshu ran back to the East Courtyard, she rushed into her room and shut her door. Her heart was still beating wildly. She pressed on her chest strongly and slowly calmed down. She still felt as if her heart was about to jump out of her throat.</span><span style>“Ji Yunshu, it’s impossible. I tell you it's impossible! He is a prince and you a concubine-born child. It’s impossible!” She nibbled her lips while brainwashing herself. Since the moment she learned of Ji Pei's death, her heart had died as well. Her heart could not accommodate someone else! Love should have disappeared from it with Ji Pei. Yes! It was impossible for her to have fallen in love again.</span></p>
 <p>---------------------</p>
 <p><span style>Zhangzhi hall.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ever Jing Xuan had been sitting in the hall since Ji Yunshu had left with Wei Yi, staring into empty space. She was devastated. She didn’t move or make a sound. The palace maids came to her several times and spoke a few words out of concern. But, she paid them no heed. She still couldn’t accept that Ji Yunshu had turned out to be female although a few hours had passed since she had learnt of it.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Several voices shouted “Your Ladyship!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>After Concubine Xiao had sent the ladies she had invited to her banquet away, she went to Qi Zhen, now she hurried to her daughter. She waved at Sang Lan. “Wait outside. No one is allowed to come inside without my permission.”</span><span style>“Yes, Your Ladyship!” Sang Lan obeyed.</span><span style>As everyone withdrew, Concubine Xiao walked into the hall. She saw her daughter sitting blankly. She sighed and walked over while calling her. “Xuan’er!”</span><span style>Jing Xuan lifted her eyes but turned away in anger when she saw her mother.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I didn’t get angry at you when you blatantly left with Teacher Ji, but you actually had an attitude with me.”</span><span style>Jing Xuan didn’t respond.</span><span style>Although Concubine Xiao was angry, Jing Xuan was still her treasured daughter. After several hours, her anger was almost completely gone. “Xuan’er, I have a few things to say. It’s impossible between you and Teacher Ji.”</span><span style>“Yes, it’s impossible because imperial mother already knew she is a woman.” Jing Xuan glared at her mother with red eyes. </span><span style>Concubine Xiao wasn’t shocked by Jing Xuan’s words. On the contrary, her anger rose, but she did her utmost to repress it. “Even if she was a man, it would still be impossible for you to be together.” She scolded.</span><span style>“Of course, you already knew the truth.”</span></p>
