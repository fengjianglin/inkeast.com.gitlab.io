 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu returned to her residence through the backdoor of West Side courtyard. She had just arrived in her courtyard when she chanced upon Luan’er standing outside and crying with worry.</span><span style>When Luan’er saw her miss return, she had to blink twice.</span><span style>“Miss, you have returned.” Luan’er was tense.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu was neither hurried nor slow. But this time, she stared at her maidservant with narrowed eyes. “What happened? You’re always bustling with energy. Didn’t Lord Liu send someone to inform you i wouldn’t be back for the night yesterday?”</span><span style>This girl, every time there was an emergency, she would get all emotional and anxious!</span><span style>However, Luan’er vigorously shook her head. “It isn’t that. It’s… The Wei family has come. R-right now, they are in the front hall. Just a moment ago, Master’s servant came and told me to quickly bring you there to meet the Wei family.”</span><span style>The Wei family? It seems they had come to propose marriage!</span><span style>That ravenous wolf seriously made his move too fast. He was determined to marry her off quickly.</span><span style>She took a deep breath. It looked like she won’t be able to take a nap. </span><i><span style>‘I really have shitty luck today!’</span></i><span style>She entered her room and quickly changed out of her male clothing. Then, she rolled her hair into a simple bun and put on a bit of makeup before leaving for the front hall.</span><span style>Inside the front hall, a group of people sat in a rough circle.</span><span style>With a quick glance, Ji Yunshu saw that the table was filled with all kind of different sized boxes. It must be the Wei family’s betrothal gifts.</span><span style>From the master seat, Ji Shuhan noticed her arrival. Every time he saw her, his face would distort into a fierce appearance, but this time, he displayed a very benevolent appearance.</span><span style>“Yunshu, why did it take you so long to come? Your Uncle Wei and Aunt Wei waited for quite some time.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu looked at the Wei couple and bowed. “Uncle Wei and Aunt Wei, Yunshu is late. I hope you will forgive me.”</span><span style>The people from the Wei family still hadn’t spoken, yet the dignified looking Ji Muqing interjected, speaking in an affected manner, “Little sister is too spoiled. It’s already the hour of the snake. Did you just wake up?”</span><span style>“Muqing, don’t be rude.”</span><span style>The words came from the Ji family’s Old Madame, Ji Yunshu’s paternal grandmother.</span><span style>The Old Madame was attired in dark purple silk and bluish-green satin. Embroidered onto her gown were exquisite phoenixes and peonies, done at an embroidery shop in Suzhou. Her white hair was rolled into a bun, combed into an extremely elegant and dignified style, decorated by jade, pearl and golden hairpins. Each item was the epitome of luxury. On her neck hung a necklace made out of 99 white jade pearls, coiling around her neck into two rows. The most eye-catching jewelry were the silver phoenix bracelets on both of her wrists. Stories said that they were bestowed by the deceased emperor when he was still alive and were exceedingly precious.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Garbed in such gorgeous apparel, the Old Madame’s appearance shocked Ji Yunshu. If archaeologists were fortunate enough to dig out her skeletal remains, it would turn into big news within the archeology circle.</span><span style>Therefore after thinking it over a few times, if she really could return to the modern world, she absolutely must record the place the Old Madame would be buried.</span><span style>Anyways, speaking of strange matters, the Ji family’s descendants were originally numerous and prosperous. Ji Shuhan had married four wives, yet they all died from an illness in rapid succession. Now, the Ji family’s household matters were completely grasped by the 60-year-old Old Madame Ji.</span><span style>After Old Madame Ji reprimanded Ji Muqing, she addressed Ji Yunshu, “Ah! Yunshu! For the matter of your marriage, your father and I have already helped you settle it. We have agreed to the Wei family’s proposal. In the future, when you marry, you will go to the Wei Mansion. You must keep calm and not cause a ruckus, lest you make a fool out of yourself.”</span><span style>Ju Yunshu didn’t reply, it was already extremely clear in her heart. The most intelligent person in the Ji family wasn’t Ji Shuhan, but that Old Madame who put on a facade of compassion and virtue.</span><span style>In her youth, perhaps, she was quite a ruthless mistress!</span><span style>If not, how could she sit at this position so stably, and for so long.</span><span style>Between the time when Old Madame spoke, Madame Wei was observing Ji Yunshu. Her appearance was proof of the endless satisfaction she had.</span><span style>She got up and amiably pulled on Ji Yunshu’s arm, gently smiling at her. “This child’s appearance is truly remarkable. I’ve often heard about you from your grandmother and father. As expected, slender and elegant, truly a match with our Yi’er.”</span><span style>She turned around and swept the hall with a glance. She was baffled. “Yi’er was just there a moment ago. Where did he disappear to in such a short time?” </span><span style>Lord Wei stated, “He must have run out just a moment ago.”</span><span style>“That child. Today is his marriage proposal. Instead of looking at his soon-to-be bride he’s just running off to play?” Madame Wei was grumbling, but immediately “consoled” Ji Yunshu. “Yunshu, don’t mind him. Yi’er might be rude, but he has a good heart. You are surely kindhearted and an intelligent child. Don’t take offense to it. After you marry into our family, you need to be very tolerant and get along with him. You must not avoid our Yi’er.”</span><span style>She hadn’t even passed through their doors yet. This kind of flattering was too unreal!</span><span style>“Aunt Wei is teasing me. How can I, Yunshu, turn my back on Young Master Wei? A daughter’s wedding has always been the parent’s command. The matchmaker said that marrying into your home is my good fortune.” As she spoke, she raised her head and glanced at her father.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As expected, that ravenous wolf was extremely satisfied with her words! Madame Wei was also extremely satisfied. She nodded firmly, her eyes filled with love. Her foolish son will now soon have a wife!</span><span style>Ji Shuhan stroked his beard and said to Lord Wei, “Lord Wei, you know that my daughters are my heart and flesh.”</span><span style>‘I understand. If someday, you need help, you only need to tell me.” Lord Wei nodded.</span><span style>“If you say so, then I’ll feel reassured. Then this marriage is settled. As for the money and the wedding gifts, we can take our time discussing it.”</span><span style>Lord Wei smiled and momentarily showed a grand and imposing appearance. “My wife and I only have Yi’er as a son. For the monetary gift, our Wei family absolutely doesn’t lack any.”</span><span style>Saying so, he took a load off Ji Shuhan’s mind.</span><span style>There were only two reasons to marry a daughter: money and status!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu stood obediently in the middle of the hall. She wasn’t talkative nor did she look around. Both families were in heated discussion over the preparations of her wedding, and her attention wandered until the Old Madame called her.</span><span style>“Yunshu, it would be better if you go inside to find Young Master Wei and have a nice chat with him. As for your wedding, your father and I will arrange everything for you.”</span><span style>Madame Wei also hastily said, “That’s a good idea. It’s better if you go find Yi’er. You two should meet first.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>It just so happened that Ji Yunshu didn’t want to stay either. She simply greeted them and obediently retreated. The sharp-eyed Ji Muqing curved her phoenix eyes and didn’t let Ji Yunshu leave her sight until she had left.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu was finally released from the abyss of suffering. She took in a deep breath of the cold fresh air and patted the place on her sleeve that was pulled by Madame Wei.</span><span style>‘My</span><i><span style> sleeve is all wrinkled!’ </span></i><span style>Madame Wei must be afraid that her daughter-in-law would run away!</span><span style>She yawned. She was now beyond tired and had no intention of searching for Wei Yi. She’d rather go back to her courtyard.</span><span style>She was prepared to go back and take a long nap. She still needed to go to the memorial hall this afternoon! Just when she passed through a long corridor near the backyard, she heard mocking voices.</span><span style>“An idiot also knows how to write? This is truly an oddity in this world.”</span><span style>That voice, wasn’t that the voice of her obstinate and troublesome third brother, Ji Yuanzhi?</span><span style>“Third Brother, Third Brother! Who is this idiot? Why is he in our home?”</span><span style>This time the voice belonged to Ji Lingzhi, Ji Yunshu’s eight-year-old fourth sister.</span><span style>“He is the Wei family’s idiot. In the future, he will be Third Sister’s husband.”</span><span style>“I don’t want that kind of idiot as my brother-in-law. I don’t wanna…”</span><span style>Ji Linzhi’s sharp and shrill voice was absolutely ear-piercing.</span></p>
