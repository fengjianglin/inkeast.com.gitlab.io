 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>After returning to the Ji’s estate, Ji Yunshu was hit by fatigue. She changed into clean clothes and shoes, sat next to the warm stove, and kneaded the space between her eyebrows.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss, you’re still not resting?” Luan’er was baffled.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu shook her head, then drank a cup of tea, appearing like she was waiting for something. As she expected, a pageboy speedily arrived at the front courtyard and stated, “Third Miss, Master is waiting for you in the anteroom. You have to come without delay.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu grunted in assent. Ji Shuhan had been disgusted with her being in contact with dead people since the start. Today, in his presence, she’d openly fiddled with those corpses. For Ji Shuhan, who regarded family traditions as his life, he probably couldn’t wait to skin her alive!</span></p>
 <p><span style>When she arrived at the anteroom, her vicious father was waiting for her. Once he noticed her arrival, his originally angry expression transformed into a roaring sea of fury as he fiercely glared down at her.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Truly the look of a ravenous wolf!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard, kneel!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fuming, Ji Shuhan snapped out an order through gritted teeth.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu had always possessed a character that didn’t seek dispute, regarding things with a cold detachment. Therefore, she obediently kneeled down.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Our Ji family has produced a lineage of offspring that have grown up to be honorable military and civil officials. But then, there’s you, a little bastard who actually goes and touches those unclean things, destroying this family’s rules and traditions. You, alone, are making my Ji family lose face.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu kept her head low, not uttering a word in her defense. Needless to say, this dull temper of hers was what Ji Shuhan loathed the most. It drove him mad with anger and impatience.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Wei family had visited us a few times seeking a marriage. I already agreed. After the end of this year, you will be married into the Wei family. This will spare my Ji family from losing face again.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A married daughter is like spilled water; once Ji Yunshu was married into the Wei family, she would become the Wei family’s people. Thus, her being in contact with corpses would no longer be related to his Ji family. If there was any loss of face, it would be the Wei family’s matter instead. With this much planning, it seems like Ji Shuhan had perhaps calculated this a long time ago.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However… Ji Yunshu’s whole body shook for a moment, slightly stunned. The young master of the Wei family had fallen sick when he was a child and was now a mentally stunted idiot. The whole city of Jinjiang knew about it! There was no one who didn’t know about it!</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father, you should know about the circumstance of the Wei family’s young master. If your daughter were to marry, wouldn’t…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Shuhan slammed his hands down on the table, interrupting her words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Since ancient times, marriage has been decided by the parents. The matter is already settled, and you have no say in it. The Wei family are descendants of generals. For such an illustrious household to take a fancy to you, this is your blessing.” Her father’s speech forcibly choked the words - “empty marriage, widow from the start” - in Ji Yunshu’s throat. She raised her almond eyes and gave a faint, but stubborn retort.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Daughter is unwilling to marry into the Wei family. I would rather spend my days alone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Bastard! Are those words that a family’s daughter should say? Although the Wei family’s young master is an imbecile, he is the sole scion of the family. After you marry him, naturally, you won’t receive much in the way of grievances. Besides, the Wei family and the Ji family usually have many business dealings together. </span><span style>I will not let this be destroyed by your hands.</span><span style> You will get married whether you like it or not.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Father…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Shuhan’s face turned red from anger. “Tonight, you will kneel here as punishment. Reflect properly. If you dare to disobey again, I will end your life myself and consider myself as never having a daughter like you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With that, he flourished his sleeves and left.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If this was in modern days, it would simply be a political marriage. To sum it up, Ji Yunshu was simply a mere chess piece in her father’s eyes. No, in fact, all four misses within the mansion were nothing but chess pieces for him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The eldest daughter, Ji Muqing had long been cultivated to become the Crown Prince’s consort. It was said that Ji Shuhan hadn’t spared any effort, calling in every favor so that this coming year, Ji Muqing would be sent to the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The second daughter, Ji Wanxing, was frail and sick ever since she was a child. However, she had long been promised to the Minister of Rites’ son. In two years, she would also be sent to the capital.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for the fourth daughter, Ji Lingzhi, she was still young, merely an eight-year-old child. However, a few years ago, when Ji Shuhan and Old Madame Ji had gone to the capital to deal with some matters, they also promised her to someone, and the other party was the nephew of Zhao </span><i><span style>qinwang[1.<em>Qingwang </em>(亲王) is a prince title, but not any kind of princes. Only princes that are favored and the direct descendants of the emperor will be granted this title. The princes are separated into four ranks.&nbsp;<em>Qingwang&nbsp;</em>is a first-ranked. For more information, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Royal_and_noble_ranks_of_the_Qing_dynasty#Male_members" target="_blank" rel="noopener">click here</a>.],</span></i><span style> who was a first-ranked prince.</span></p>
 <p><span style>This gap in treatment was definitely too great!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She tightly wrapped her clothes around her body and let out a breath of cold air. Getting married, okay. A political marriage, fine. But getting married to an intellectually deficient person, she was extremely unwilling. It’s quite possible that Ji Shuhan would tie her up before sending her to the Wei’s residence if it was necessary. It seems like sooner or later she would have to leave the Ji family… </span></p>
