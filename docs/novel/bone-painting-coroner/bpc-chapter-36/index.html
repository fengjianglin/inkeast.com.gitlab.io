 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong weakly whispered in Ji Yunshu’s ear.</span><span style>His entire body was limp, but he still tried to act brave.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu’s hands felt like they were on fire as she struggled to support him. Her fingers unknowingly tightened around him.</span><span style>The weight of his body gradually caused her knees to buckle. Finally, she gritted her teeth and pressed on a part of Jing Rong’s waist. He, who was on the verge of falling to the ground, suddenly stood tautly.</span><span style>The distance between them shrank to a paper-thin distance as Ji Yunshu’s ear flattened against Jing Rong’s strong chest. She could hear the cadence of his heartbeat. At that instant, his heartbeat seemed to magnify many folds, making a deep drumming sound in her ear.</span><span style>But, this was not the time for her to blush.</span><span style>“You… Hold on. I’ll carry you, so don’t move.”</span><span style>She used everything she had to support him, but when it came to moving forward, she could not take a single step.</span><span style>How about she just let go of him, so he could fall and “break into pieces”.</span><span style>The thought crossed her mind for a moment and was very sinister.</span><i><span style>‘That won’t do!’</span></i><span style>“Your Highness!”</span><span style>Like the sound of Providence, a voice was heard not far away.</span><span style>Lang Po was first alarmed by the corpses. Soon after, he rushed in and caught sight of his Prince in an ambiguous position with Ji Yunshu, causing his brain to short-circuit.</span><span style>“What are you standing there and looking dumb for? Hurry up and take your Prince.” Ji Yunshu’s tone was heavy.</span><span style>Lang Po was a strong man, so he was far from being delicate and attentive like a girl. He roughly separated the two of them and took over from Ji Yunshu in supporting his master. He was ready to bring Jing Rong back into the hall.</span><span style>“Where are you going? Put him down.” Her voice was urgent and her expression grave.</span><span style>Lang Po obeyed her without hesitation, laying the unconscious Jing Rong on the freezing ground.</span><span style>In a second, Ji Yunshu was squatting next to Jing Rong and tearing her sleeves into a long strip.</span><span style>After a moment, she grabbed Jing Rong’s tattered sleeve and ripped it away, tearing it until his wound was clearly exposed.</span><span style>His arm was dyed in black blood! </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Po cried out in alarm, “His Highness is injured?” </span><i><span style>‘Hey fellow, are you blind? Your Prince is unconscious. If he’s not injured, did you think he was sleeping?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>At this moment, Ji Yunshu could not be bothered to explain the situation to him.</span><span style><span>She used the long strip made from her sleeve and made a tourniquet<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> around 10cm above his wound in order to slow down the spread of the poison.</span></span></p>
 <p><span style>When she was done, she raised her head and looked at Lang Po. “There’s strong liquor beside the memorial tablets on the offering table. Hurry and go get it for me.”</span><span style>“Yes sir.” His servile nature had kicked in! Lang Po ran into the house and found the strong liquor without needing to search for it. He rushed back and delivered it to Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu took the jug and poured the alcohol into her mouth. Then, she sprayed the rest on Jing Rong’s wound. In a flash, the blisters on his wound burst, releasing its contents with a sizzling sound. It was very like the bubbles in a cola bottle, except the color was similar to a dark energy drink. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Po, who was clueless about Ji Yunshu’s treatment, watched helplessly in worry. Not waiting for him to react, Ji Yunshu restrained Jing Rong’s arm with both of her hands, before leaning over him. She started to suck out the poison from his wound.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As she sucked out the black blood, she spat it out and repeated the same steps more than ten times before she stopped.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Her mouth was now covered with black blood. Although it was clearly a cold winter night, Ji Yunshu’s brow was beaded with sweat.</span><span style>Lang Po asked nervously, “Teacher, how is his highness?” </span><span style>Ji Yunshu replied, “He was exposed to Shiban poison. The effect is very fierce. Fortunately, the poison didn’t seep into his bones. He won’t die.” Then, she grabbed the jug and stood up before quickly adding, “Hurry and bring him into the house.”</span><span style>“Yes sir.” Once again, Lang Po’s servile nature resurfaced. He obeyed Ji Yunshu and brought Jing Rong into a small room that Ji Yunshu pointed to. Then, he put Jing Rong onto the bed.</span><span style>Meanwhile, Ji Yunshu went into Fu Bo’s room with the jug of alcohol and used the same method to temporarily treat Fu bo.</span><span style>Following that, she navigated the shelves of the memorial hall to find several raw medicinal materials. She hastily compounded them into a medicine which she spread on Jing Rong’s and Fu Bo’s wound. After that, she bandaged both of them up.</span><span style>If she was a bit slower in treating their injuries, only death would have awaited them.</span><span style>After being busy the whole time, her legs weakened from tiredness. She cracked her neck and took in a few deep breaths.</span><i><span style>‘It’s finally done!’</span></i><span style>Lang Po, who did not understand her actions, inquired, “Teacher, what medicine did you give to his highness?”</span><i><span style>‘Can he die from it?’</span></i><span style>This Lang Po really took after Prince Rong’s moral conduct, fearing that she would poison them.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu frowned at him, “The medicine is made from common ingredients: fresh ginger, a couple of spices and v</span><span style>iola mandshurica. I compounded them together and applied it to the wound. This can stop bleeding and absorb the poison from the wound. It won’t kill people.”</span><span style>“How did his highness get poisoned?” In fact, Ji Yunshu did not understand how the brain of those ancient people were geared. Why do they love to poison this, poison that, poison here and poison there?!</span><span style>Other than poison, hidden weapons were just as popular!</span><i><span style>‘Stupid people!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“If you want to know, let’s go out and search for those men in black. Examine the sword that almost claimed your Prince’s life.”</span><span style>Hearing Ji Yunshu’s words, Lang Po rushed out right away. ‘</span><i><span style>He isn’t planning to hack those corpses into pieces in retaliation for poisoning his master... right?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu shifted her gaze down, to Jing Rong’s pale complexion.</span><span style>At this moment, his appearance lacked its usual spirit, looking quite meek and docile with his well-shaped brows and eyes. That tall nose bridge and lips which weren’t pursed from the arrogance about his own power looked quite soft, and that sharp feeling he gave vanished.</span><i><span style>‘Ah! And look at that skin. It could only be described as perfect.’</span></i><span style>When she realized how “obsessed” she looked as she stared at him, it caused her to panic. It really did make her feel ineffably nervous.</span><span style>Then, she recalled the moment when Jing Rong shielded her by pulling her into his arms. Although she was very grateful, inwardly, she was also flushed with excitement, but only a bit.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite the fact that he was the main reason of the night's events, he did suffer from a sword slash, so she should feel grateful to this deity.</span><span style>The more she thought about it, the more confused and panicked she felt, which annoyed her to the point she became restless.</span><span style>She might as well go outside and calm down.</span><span style>She headed outside right at the time Lang Po was studying the corpses of the attackers. He was looking at them with a serious frown.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu couldn’t take it any longer and blurted out, “Not only did those killers want to take our lives, they even coated their swords with poison. It was very clear that their aim was His Highness, they wanted him dead most of all.”</span><i><span style>‘Hey! You better speak the truth. Did your Prince owe someone money? Or extort others? Or even employ a hit-man?!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Po remained silent.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu wrinkled her nose. At this moment, apart from the smell of the dead pervading the courtyard, the smell of blood was equally strong.</span><span style>Suddenly, deep within her heart, curiosity gnawed at her. She wanted to know the truth of the matter.</span><span style>She walked over to one of the corpses and was about to crouch next to it when Lang Po shouted, “Teacher! What are you doing?”</span><span style>“I’m curious.” She threw the words at him, leaving him at a loss for words.</span><span style>She promptly pulled down the mask covering the dead man’s face. Under the mask hid a dark-skinned man with a rough appearance. Clearly of foreign origin.</span><span style>It was a commoner. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu would not stop until she got to the truth, even if she was courting death. She continued to take off the masks on all the corpses.</span><span style>They were all commoners, but there was nothing strange about that.</span><span style>As soon as she got up, her foot unknowingly kicked something.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Clang!</span></i><span style>She lowered her head to take a look and saw a blue jade pendant next to her foot. She stooped down to pick it up and carefully examined it.</span><span style>The jade pendant was round and engraved with a bouquet of pear blossoms.</span><span style>The engraving could be considered quite exquisite and nice to look at.</span><span style>But, this thing also looked quite familiar!</span></p>
