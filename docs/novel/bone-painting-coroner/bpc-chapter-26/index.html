 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It was a particularly moving scene unfolding in front of Ji Yunshu. Jing Rong was using one hand to protect her, while another hand blocked the palm strike and a kick flew at the shadow’s chest.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The kick connected with a dull thud and sent the attacker to the floor, spitting out blood as he fell.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chaos broke out in front of the mourning hall.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu was well protected behind Jing Rong. On the floor, the man who was kicked by Jing Rong leaned toward Suyun.</span><span style>“Lin Duan!”</span><span style>Suyun suddenly screamed, crawling over to the man who’d fallen. She started crying when she saw him spitting blood.</span><span style>He felt a burst of pain on his chest, but once he saw Suyun, his face broke into a warm smile. He stretched out his hand to stroke her face.</span><span style>“Yun’er, I’m fine. Don’t worry.”</span><span style>“It’s because I’m no good. I always end up harming you.”</span><span style>“Don’t say that! Yun’er, for you, I can do anything.”</span><span style>“Lin Duan, I implicated you.”</span><span style>The sight of this pair of unfortunate lovers together was indeed, quite touching.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yet, Jing Rong’s face displayed anger. His eyes seemed like twin balls of fire as he stared at Ji Yunshu. Their eyes locked together. His questioning tone made it obvious he was restraining his anger with effort. “Is that your way of fishing out the two murderers?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu bluntly nodded.</span><span style>“This method is prohibited!” Jing Rong vetoed it without a second’s hesitation.</span><span style>Why was this deity so easy to anger? She wasn’t afraid of dying, so what was he afraid of? She felt reluctant to try and guess his mind. Instead, she neatly twisted out of his grasp with a side step. In the end, they were two “grown men”. Sticking so close to each other, it would be hard to avoid people gossipping!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She took another glance at the unfortunate lovers. She really hated to break them apart. However, it wasn’t the time to feel sorry for them.</span><span style>“It appears that you are Suyun’s lover, the accomplice who helped her to create that accidental fall. &nbsp;At that time, the reason why Qiaoxin couldn’t see anyone else in the attic was because you’d hidden yourself under the roof. You waited until Qiaoxin was below the attic to push down Miss Zhou, leaving no trace of your presence.”</span><span style>At this point, Lin Duan didn’t even bother to deny anything. Instead, his face was brimming with rancor as he grit his teeth.</span><span style>“Damn her! She tormented Yun’er to the point that her life was worse than death, and still didn’t plan on stopping. She went as far as to cause Yun’er’s miscarriage. Damn her! She deserved to die!”</span><span style>“Lin Duan, don’t say it.” Suyun wept until she was weary.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu was at a loss for words.</span><span style>While Madame Zhou was on the verge of fainting. She looked over at the pair of lovers, with hatred enveloping every inch of her heart.</span><span style>“What a good pair of indecent people. Our Zhou family didn’t treat you badly, but you collaborated with each other to kill my daughter!”</span><span style>“Dear, since the identities of the murderers are revealed, I will notify Lord Liu. Please take care of your health, so that no harm comes to you.” Lord Zhou sighed, then turned to the servants and beckoned them over with a wave of his hand. “Bring them to the yamen. Let Lord Liu take care of the rest.”</span><span style>“Yes.”</span><span style>Several male servants stepped forward and supported them up. But they didn’t released their grips and continued to restrain the couple.</span><span style>“Yun’er, you should’ve listened to me. We should’ve left this place yesterday night.” Lin Duan cried out in regret.</span><span style>Tears were falling from Suyun’s face.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu interjected, “Did you believe that you can escape if you left yesterday?”</span><span style>Lin Duan coldly smiled. “Why couldn’t I escape? If Yun’er had agreed to leave with me yesterday, we wouldn’t have fallen into your hands today.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t know where his confidence came from. She bluntly stated, “If you had tried to escape the Zhou mansion yesterday, you would have been welcomed by an arrow piercing into your heart.”</span><span style>“Huh?”</span><span style>As the words came out, a burst of footsteps could be heard in the distance.</span><span style>A dozen yamen runners burst into the mourning hall and surrounded them. Liu Qingping, followed closely by Lang Po, had arrived together.</span><span style>Lang Po remained silent, walking until he was next to Prince Rong, taking his place behind his lord.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As for Lord Liu, he’d transformed from his usually cowardly and scoundrel’s persona, donning the bearing of a county magistrate. He issued a firm order. “Grab those people and send them to the prison, where they will await for this official to report to the Ministry of Justice. I will handle their punishment after that.”</span><span style>“Yes, Milord.”</span><span style>The yamen runners took Suyun and Lin Duan from the Zhou’s servants and shackled their wrists with iron chains.</span><span style>Lin Duan asked in a tone of surprise, “You knew beforehand that it was us and had arranged for people guarding outside?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu replied, “Incorrect. I only made Lord Liu to deploy people outside just in case, I didn’t know about your identity yet. However, if you had tried to leave the place with Suyun yesterday, it would have been an irrevocable confession to your crime!”</span><span style>“I believed that there was absolutely no oversight in the plan, but I never expected that I was playing into your hand.” However grudging, his tone contained some trace of admiration!</span><span style>The county magistrate waved his hand. “Hurry up and detain them.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The yamen runners were well versed in crowd control, and promptly corralled anyone who wanted to leave. Suyun stopped in front of Ji Yunshu and stared at her for a moment before asking, “How did you know that I injured my leg and that I was pregnant?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu replied with a solemn expression, “Last night, I deliberately tripped your leg. So, of course, I’ll know you have a bone fracture there. As for how I knew you were pregnant, it’s because I took notice of your hipbone. For women who miscarried, their pelvis would be obviously retracted.”</span><span style>Suyun gasped in surprise.</span><span style>“Teacher Ji, you are very intelligent. You only saw my handkerchief once, but you were already capable of clearly deducing my story. But I don’t regret anything. That night, as I looked at her body on the floor, poisoned and devoid of life, within the darkness enclosing me, I suddenly felt... liberated. I no longer need to endure her torments, to feel any of that pain. If I had to make the same choice again, I would still choose to kill her.”</span><span style>Suyun’s confession made Ji Yunshu feel disturbed and extremely upset. She rubbed the handkerchief in her hand before giving it back to Suyun.</span><span style>“I’m returning this to its rightful owner.”</span><span style>“Thank you.” Suyun took it softly, and calmly smiled.</span><span style>Finally, Suyun and Lin Duan were sent to the prison. Once again, Zhou Mansion sank into an atmosphere of deep sorrow.</span><span style>In the end, Madame Zhou couldn’t take it and fainted. Lord Zhou seemed to have aged considerably in the past day, as his whole being felt weary.</span><span style>His daughter had been ill all her life, and her maidservant was involved in an illicit affair which lead to the current tragedy. If this news was spread, the Zhou family would no longer have any standing in Jinjiang city.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu spoke, “Lord Zhou, my condolences.”</span><span style>“Teacher Ji, thank you very much for finding the ones who killed my daughter. Unfortunately, as a father, I am truly ashamed. My own daughter was ill, but I hadn’t even noticed that.”</span><span style>“No one can blame you for that. This humble one has said earlier, this kind of illness is not easy to detect as the symptoms are not evident most of the time.”</span><span style>Lord Zhou sighed heavily once more.</span><span style>Because Ji Yunshu hadn’t returned to her home the whole night, she was really worried that her absence would be discovered by that ravenous wolf of a father. Well, in the case that it had fallen apart, there wasn’t many things tying her there anyway.</span><span style>The county magistrate hastily returned to the yamen to write a report for the Ministry of Justice, leaving first.</span><span style>Under the big snowy sky, Ji Yunshu departed soon after from Zhou mansion with an umbrella in hand.</span><span style>However, she had yet to walk very far when Jing Rong chased after her and walked with her, side by side.</span><span style>Under the sky filled with snowflakes, they threaded the streets together, leaving their footprints imprinted on the mantle of snow. Both of them were holding an umbrella, forming a special, inclusive, atmosphere.</span><span style>As for Lang Po, he was following behind them in the distance.</span><span style>Jing Rong glanced at Ji Yunshu and glimpsed the slight frown at the tips of her brows. She’d obviously solved a case, but why did she look like this? “Did Teacher Ji have something on your mind?”</span><span style>She nodded. “I have this strange feeling.”</span><span style>“Strange? What’s strange?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu slightly hesitated. Her steps came to a halt and glanced at the confused Jing Rong.</span><span style>“I was thinking about that sculpted crystal candlestick.”</span></p>
