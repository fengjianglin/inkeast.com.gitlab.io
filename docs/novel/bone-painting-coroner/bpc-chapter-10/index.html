 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The county magistrate glanced furtively at Jing Rong. He saw that Jing Rong had picked up the teacup lid and lightly covered his cup. The strength of his wrist’s movement was neither weak nor strong. His expression remained the same, completely neutral, making it difficult for Liu Qingping to determine whether the news displeased Jing Rong or not.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s nose twitched twice; and the magistrate hurriedly started to explain, “Prince Rong, Teacher Ji has worked hard the past few days. He should be tired. Yesterday, this lowly official had agreed to let him rest for a day. It would be better if…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong interrupted him, “It would be better if I come back tomorrow?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>For other people, they would feel nothing amiss when they heard those words, but in this situation, those words sounded like a “fault” to Liu Qingping’s ears. His whole body violently shook; he immediately kneeled and kowtowed. “This lowly official absolutely didn’t mean it!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong tightly knit his eyebrows. “Why do stately, benevolent officials always kneel at every single ghastly fault? Is there a law that requires you to kneel every time there is a fault made in the Great Qing Legal Code?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Po followed up. “There isn’t, Prince Rong.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingping’s face grew stiff as his complexion paled. He was a stately county magistrate, but... </span><i><span style>‘You are as high above me as the venerated Buddha would be!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Just get up and stop kneeling at every turn.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Th-thank you Prince Rong.” Liu Qingping got up in a daze and lowered his head. He didn’t dare look directly at Jing Rong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s eyes narrowed slightly. His thin lips hooked upwards as an oppressive aura emitted from his body. He asked, “Lord Liu, since Teacher Ji belongs to the yamen as a worker, certainly he must have the peace and prosperity of the common people at heart, am I right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qinping meekly nodded. “You are correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yesterday, my subordinates were found dead under tragic circumstances. Logic would dictate that you investigate the matter and uncover the truth for me, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s correct.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Therefore, looking for him so that he can help resolve this murder case for me, is it a must, or not?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s a must!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong was extremely pleased. “Good. You have the time it takes for a cup of tea to bring him over.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Ah? The time it takes for a cup of tea?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This was clearly making things difficult for him! But Liu Qingping didn’t dare refuse. He anxiously moved backwards towards the door. “Y-y-yes my prince. This lowly official will go right away.” As soon as he got the words out clearly, he lifted his uniform and rushed out like a madman.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s expression was stern, but now his doubts had woken. Lang Po stroked his jaw as he mused, “Prince Rong, from Lord Liu’s words, that Teacher Ji seems to possess the ability to draw the appearance of the deceased even if only their bones remained. Perhaps… he could help investigate that old case.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong remained silent, but the crease between his eyebrows remained. His long and narrow eyes now held a sly intent. After a long time, he asked, “If we include today, how long have we been away from the capital?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s been more than half a year.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We passed through how many counties?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“More than a hundred.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong grunted but smiled with his eyes. Then, he brought the teacup to his mouth.</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">..........</span></p>
 <p><span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">At the backdoor of the Ji family’s West Side courtyard, Liu Qingping raised his hand and knocked on the door. Luan’er hurriedly opened it and saw the county magistrate. The very sight of him stirred her displeasure.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry, hurry! Call Ji Yunshu! We’re going to the yamen. There’s a major situation, an earth-shattering situation.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Miss said that she wasn’t working today.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingping slapped his thigh and let out an “Aiya!” Sweating profusely from worry, he pushed through the half-opened door and charged into the courtyard in big strides.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he reached outside the room, he rushed inside and yelled, “Yunshu, this official has come to find you. We absolutely must go to the yamen. If you don’t go, it will be difficult for me to keep my official hat! Please have pity and mercy on me, and go to the yamen with me!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>An official beseeching a commoner, this was unheard of!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the room, Ji Yunshu was already awake by the time she heard the county magistrate’s voice. So, she slipped into men’s clothes, neither hurried nor slowed, and carried her sandalwood box under her arm.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Dressing like this... is Yunshu going to the yamen?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu tossed a sugar-coated lotus seed in her mouth and walked out of her room. As she stepped out, she saw Liu Qingping panicking, practically kneeling in front of her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Milord, what’s wrong?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>With no time to explain, Liu Qingping simply grabbed Ji Yunshu and rushed out.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Hurry! Follow me! Someone is looking for you at the yamen. It’s an important guest. Not going is out of the question!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu was dragged along by Liu Qingping in big strides. Unable to take her wrist back from his strong grip, she frowned. “Milord, what is going on? Didn’t I tell the yamen runner that I’m not going to work today?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The county magistrate was puzzled as his sight swept her up and down. She was dressed in men’s clothes and held her sandalwood box. Isn’t this how she usually dressed when going to work?</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You don’t intend to go to the yamen with me?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu shook her head. “No.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then, where </span><i><span style>are </span></i><span style>you going?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Zhou’s residence.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingping failed to understand. “Why are you going to Zhou Mansion? Their young miss has died, and they are going to bury her today. Hurry and follow me to the yamen.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The murder case of Zhou family’s young miss doesn’t need to be investigated?” Ji Yunshu softly inquired.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘What? The murder case of Zhou family’s young miss?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingping widened his eyes, doubling in size. He felt as if someone had just scraped his spine. He asked in a trembling voice, “She didn’t accidentally fall to her death on that rock in her garden?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu stared at him. “I’ve always given you a written report of my cases when I finish. Didn’t I give you the report of the Zhou family’s case?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not yet.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“And, did I ever say that the Zhou family’s young miss accidentally fell to her death?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Liu Qingping thought about it and shook his head. “You also didn’t mention that.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘How odd. Didn’t she fall to her death? How did it become a murder case?”</span></i></p>
