 <p></p>
 <p><span style>The injuries on her back no longer hurt. Ji Yunshu massaged the space between her eyebrows before she prudently sat up in her bed in fear of opening her wounds again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Luan’er!” She called out twice, but there was no response.</span><i><span style>‘That girl, where could she ran off to so early in the morning?’</span></i><span style>She descended from her bed. She fetched the blue and wide cloak hung on the coat rack before wrapping herself with it and leaving the room. But still no Luan’er in sight.</span><span style>She was just about to return to her room when she heard the clear sounds of footsteps approaching from behind her.</span><span style>She turned her head and a panting Luan’er came into her sight. In the maidservant’s hands, she held into a long box covered by a patterned brocade cloth that was exuding an extremely elegant taste.</span><span style>“Miss, why are you up? Are the wounds on your back still hurting?” Worry could be seen on Luan’er face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did the thing in your hands come from?” Ji Yunshu attentively studied the brocade box in Luan’er hands.</span><span style>Luan’er raised the brocade box higher and said, “This was given by the honorable guests from the capital who came previously, and they had visited us again. They gave everyone a gift and they are still discussing with Master in the reception hall.”</span><span style>“Honorable guests? From the capital?”</span><span style>“Yes.” Luan’er nodded.</span><i><span style>‘Could it be Jing Rong?’</span></i><span style> The doubts rose inside Ji Yunshu’s heart. She still received the brocade box and instructed Luan’er. “Go to the reception hall and find out what my father and the honorable guest are discussing about.”</span><i><span style>‘Huh? I have to peep and eavesdrop?!’ </span></i><span style>Luan’er was bewildered. “Miss, thi-”</span><span style>“Go quickly.”</span><span style>“Oh! Oh!” Luan’er energetically dashed to the reception hall to spy on others!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu went back into her room with the box. Inside her room, she opened the box revealing the object inside - </span><span style>Turniplike cowparsnip root. A turniplike cowparsnip root wasn’t a rare medicinal ingredient, but its market price was quite exorbitant. In addition, it was also strangely effective when treating whip wounds.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Faintly, something stirred deep inside her heart. </span><i><span style>‘What a coincidence!’ </span></i><span style>The gift from the capital guest was like charcoal in snowy weather!</span></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head. It was more important to handle her back injuries now while it didn’t hurt. She walked to a shelf behind her table and took her sandalwood box. Then, she took out a white paper from it and spread it on the table.</span></p>
 <p><span style>For a moment, her brain imagined what she planned to put on paper. Next, she took out a golden ink brush and she dipped it into the back inkstone before drawing on the paper. Halfway through, the distinctive image of human bones drawn in black ink took shape. With careful observation, it could be seen that the bones were, in fact, the different parts of a human skull! And it was the sketch of the yin yang corpse’s skull!</span><span style>The skull was divided into 23 parts, all composed of bones of different sizes and shapes which included numerous flat bones and irregular bones.</span><span style>Even the smallest part was carefully drawn and separated.</span><span style>It appeared as if she was reconstructing a skull model. This was one of Ji Yunshu’s habits; deconstruction of something whole before reassembling it following the shape and size of it. She would use clay to shape each piece based on what she drew and piece them together to form a 3D skull model. After she was done with it, she would once again draw the portrait by looking at the clay skull.</span><span style>The methods she used to reproduce the portrait of the deceased that only had skeletal remains were unlike those she used for corpses that were still covered in rotten flesh.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Even in the modern times, despite the presence of high tech computers and composite programs, she still needed to put in a lot of effort in reproducing the portrait of the deceased before death. Furthermore, there aren’t any computers in this place! She had no other choice but to use this kind of method.</span><span style>After she put down the ink brush, her white fingers tapped the edge of the paper.</span><span style>It was also the first time she came across a yin yang person.</span><span style>After pondering on it for a moment, her thoughts went off on another tangent.</span><span style>She paused for a moment, then rolled up the sketch of the skull and put it aside. Then, she unfolded another sheet of paper.</span><span style>She rearranged the paint container in the first layer of her box before adding water to the indented slots on the second layer of it. Next, she dipped her brush in the paint and water before starting to paint.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Meanwhile, Luan’er who have received her order had left to spy at the reception hall. She tiptoed quietly, not daring to approach too near. She simply hid herself behind several maidservants and eavesdropped at the occupants inside.</span><span style>Inside the reception hall, Ji Shuhan was standing still. His posture slightly bent. His usually fiendish and arrogant appearance had become one exuding flattery and fawning, with a deferential smile plastered on his face.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong, who was sitting, revealed a faint smile which exuded a feeling making people’s anxious. A deterring impression that kept strangers at bay!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s sharp and cold eyes sized up Ji Shuhan before he snorted, “Lord Ji, please sit down. This prince doesn’t like looking up at people.” His tone came out overbearing.</span><span style>Jing Rong referring Ji Shuhan as Lord Ji wasn’t a false act as Ji Shuhan was the assistant minister in the Ministry of Rites in his younger days!</span><span style>Yet Ji Shuhan didn’t sit, though he did lowered his head for appearance sake and said, “It’s better if this lowly official keeps standing.”</span><span style>“This prince let you sit, so just sit.”</span><span style>“Yes, your highness.”</span><span style>Only then, Ji Shuhan raised the bottom of his robe before sitting next to Jing Rong.</span><span style>“Prince Rong, today you came with such precious gifts for this lowly official’s family members, I don’t know if… there was any reason for your visit?”</span><i><span style>‘What? Did Ji Shuhan really believe that I came here because I had nothing better to do?’</span></i><span style>Jing Rong was a grand and magnificent prince. There was no need for him to go find Ji Shuhan.</span><span style>While a smile, Jing Rong picked up the teacup. He narrowed his eyes and after what may seem like ages, he spoke, “I heard that in your younger days, when Lord Ji was still an official, my imperial father had bestowed upon you a horsewhip with a handle made of golden brocade and jade. Was it true?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>As the mention of the whip, comprehension suddenly dawned on Ji Shuhan’s face. “To be bestowed a reward by the emperor is the blessing of this official’s three lifetimes.”</span><span style>“Oh? I heard horsewhip was a tribute from Persia, made from golden eagle’s leather. I wonder if I would have the honor to see it?” Jing Rong’s eyebrows tightly knitted.</span></p>
 <p><span style>When he heard Jing Rong, Ji Shuhan hurriedly stated, “If Prince Rong want to see it, I will bring it out.” He then turned to a servant and gave his order. “Go and bring out the horsewhip.”</span><span style>The servant dashed out and went to take the horsewhip without any delay. A yellow brocade box was brought in, showing how carefully selected it was!</span><span style>Ji Shuhan took out the whip from the box and respectfully presented it to Jing Rong. “Your Highness, this is the horsewhip bestowed by his majesty the emperor.”</span><i><span style>‘I know it’s a bestowed reward. No need to repeat it again and again!’ </span></i><span style>Jing Rong put down the teacup in his hand. He raised an eyebrow and as he beamed a smile, the smile showed a hint of slyness in it.</span><span style>He took the whip and examined it. Suddenly, he wrinkled his nose and said, “This whip is very exquisite, but… why does is there a bloody scent on it?”</span><span style>“This…” Ji Shuhan became flustered.</span><span style>After the whip was used to flog Ji Yunshu, it was clearly washed and dried properly. Not even a trace of blood could be seen. Not to mention that sandalwood incense was used to purge the bloody scent from it, so how could it still smell like blood? </span><i><span style>‘Does Prince Rong have the nose of a dog?’</span></i><span style>Seeing that Ji Shuhan was tight-lipped, Jing Rong raised his chin and continued. “Not only does it smell bloody, there’s another smell on the handle. It has the stench of a beast.”</span><i><span style>‘Beast?’</span></i><span style>Wasn’t Ji Shuhan the one who held the whip before him?</span><span style>This was pointing at the mulberry tree and cursing the locust tree! If Jing Rong said two, no one would say one.</span><span style>At this instant, Ji Shuhan’s complexion couldn’t be more blue as he almost choked in his saliva, shaking non-stop from anger. “Prince Rong… How can this whip have such scent? Every day, I perfumed it with sandalwood incense.”</span><span style>“Lord Ji, you better get the doctor to examine your nose.” His expression was beaming whereas his words stung.</span><span style>However, Jing Rong didn’t feel like he was completely satisfied, so he raised the whip and asked Lang Po, “Lang Po, smell it. Tell me if my nose doesn’t have a problem.”</span><span style>“Yes, your Highness!”</span><span style>Lang Po took the whip and sniffed it before nodding. “Prince, the whip does indeed have a blood scent on it, and the handle really has the stench of a beast.”</span><span style>“Hmmm!” Jing Rong was very satisfied. His smile vanished and was suddenly replaced by a dark and stern expression.</span><span style>“Take that whip and burn it!”</span></p>
