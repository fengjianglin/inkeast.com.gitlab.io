 <p><span style>After she returned the whip to its place, Ji Yunshu stepped back. But in a seeming accident, she stumbled, almost falling to her knees. Fortunately, Qiaoxin was behind her and came to her help.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu latched onto Qiaoxin’s outstretched arm in an attempt to support herself. Simultaneously, she flipped the maidservant’s sleeve up and peeked at the arm underneath before immediately pulling it down again.</span><span style>No one was any the wiser!</span><span style>Qiaoxin asked, “Are you alright, Teacher Ji?” </span><span style>Aware that “men and women shouldn’t touch each other,” Ji Yunshu immediately leaped away before bowing her head. “Thank you very much, Miss Qiaoxin.”</span><span style>“It’s good that Teacher didn’t fall.”</span><span style>At that moment, Lord Zhou strode into the room.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu walked over to him.</span><span style>“Lord Zhou, I can see from the sky that it’s getting late. I don’t know if it’s possible to stay at Zhou mansion for the night?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course! It’s possible as long as Teacher doesn’t disdain our place. Instead, I might trouble you with my daughter’s matters.” Lord Zhou’s voice was raspy with pain. His eyes were bright with unshed tears even as he forced himself not to cry. How distressing was it for him to lose his only daughter in such a way?</span><span style>“Lord Zhou, please rest assured. This case has been received by the yamen and was assumed by Lord Liu, which also means it’s under my responsibility. I will definitely bring justice to Miss Zhou.”</span><span style>“My daughter was very obedient and had a good temper. She never quarreled with others, so I just don’t understand who could possibly plot such an evil scheme against her.”</span><span style>Lord Zhou’s appearance had undergone a great change since his daughter’s death. The dark circles under his eyes had become more pronounced.</span><span style>At present, Ji Yunshu still could not determine who the murderer was, so it was hard for her to speak of it.</span><span style>“If Lord Zhou doesn’t mind, is it possible to prepare two rooms?” A voice floated in from the entrance.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t even need to look to guess that it was Jing Rong’s voice. Why must that man be so determined to tangle with her?</span><span style>Jing Rong burst into the room like a cool breeze. His posture and demeanor carried a noble aura which was greatly incompatible with the currently gloomy atmosphere of the funeral.</span><span style>“May I ask who you are?” Lord Zhou asked in ignorance.</span><span style>Jing Rong lifted his dark pupils. “This humble one is Teacher Ji’s friend. I came with him today.”</span><span style>“It turns out to be a friend of Teacher Ji. Naturally, you are also our important guest.” Lord Zhou ordered the housekeeper at once. “Ah Jing, quickly prepare two rooms.”</span><span style>“Yes, Milord.” The housekeeper immediately replied.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu was examining Jing Rong when she coincidentally met his gaze. He had a smile hidden within the depth of his eyes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing his pleased expression, she didn’t understand why he was so be happy to stay here. He’d refused the warm pillow and the dragon bed, instead running off to sleep here on a padauk bed. That kind of hobby could only be described as weird! He was a complete weirdo!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu stealthily glanced at him numerous times, but her expression still remained unchanged.</span><span style>The day was over. Thus, the county magistrate rounded up the yamen runners and prepared to take his leave.</span><span style>As he walked forward, Ji Yunshu grabbed him, pulling him to the side, and whispered something in his ears. He blinked, but then nodded. Then, he bowed to Jing Rong and left.</span><span style>“Prince Rong, this lowly official will leave first. If you have any commands, send someone to notify us at any time.”</span><span style>“Bring Lang Po back to the yamen. Let him spend the night there. He will follow you.”</span><span style>“P-pardon?” Liu Qingping’s eyeballs almost popped out.</span><span style>Jing Rong looked at him with a sharp expression. “Do you have hearing problems?”</span><span style>The county magistrate waved his hands hastily.</span><span style>“Then, hurry and go away. Don’t be a hindrance.”</span><span style>Liu Qingping nodded quickly, completely mute.</span><span style>Lang Po followed his lord’s orders and departed with Liu Qingping.</span><span style>The rear court returned to its previously calm state. The whole mansion was suddenly shrouded in a strangely dense fog!</span><span style>A tall and majestic body with an awe-inspiring presence stood next to a lean figure who resembled the roaming clouds of the sky.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu was fully concentrating on her current matter, but she let a small groan slip out of her mouth. “This humble one didn’t say that I won’t take Prince Rong’s case. You don’t need to watch me all the time, as if afraid I would run away.”</span><span style><span>Jing Rong parted his lips and retorted, “This Prince doesn’t need to waste energy on watching you. As for running away, even if you do, you won’t be able to escape my grasp. Don’t forget that whether Lord Liu can keep his official hat<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> or not, all rests in your hands!”</span></span><span style>“Prince Rong, are you threatening me?”</span><span style>“If you behave well and take care of my problem, is there a need for threats?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu was silenced. Her eyelids lifted as she rolled her eyes. </span><i><span style>‘This prince has too sharp of a tongue!’</span></i></p>
