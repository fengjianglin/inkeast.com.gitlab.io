 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Jiang was dressed in fine silk. She wore a pair of jade circlets on her wrist, a golden hairpin in her hair, and silver earrings. Each and every one of these items was a rare treasure.</span><span style>The type of attire she wore was on the same league as Ji Muqing’s and Old Madame Ji’s.</span><i><span style>‘If I get to know where she’s buried, I definitely have to memorise the location! If by chance I was fortunate enough to excavate her burial place in the future, it will truly be a blessing!’</span></i><span style>Yet such a well-dressed lady seemed to have the word “arrogance” carved on her forehead. Her upright posture and cold expression, as well as, her tone all seemed to scream “I’m high and mighty so obey me!”</span><span style>Had she not announced her name, Ji Yunshu would have been inclined to believe that she was a distant member of the Ji family! This type of woman had always been difficult to deal with...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing that her request was to take back the corpse, the magistrate obviously denied her this. “Madame Jiang, this is a murder case; it needs to be thoroughly investigated before the corpse is returned to you.”</span><span style>“What murder case? All I know is that corpse is my husband’s, and I want to bury him </span><i><span style>immediately</span></i><span style>.” Madame Jiang’s tone emphasized this point, her gaze turning dangerous.</span><span style>“I won’t allow it! This is a murder case. Since it has been reported to the yamen, then we will investigate everything until the truth is revealed. No matter who it is, we will not obscure the truth. Everything has to go according to the procedures dictated by the laws of the Great Lin. And you, Madame Jiang, are not an exception to this.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>Wow! Oh Lord Magistrate, that was awesome. Can you see Ji Yunshu over here turning into your biggest fan?</span></i><span style>’</span><span style>Madame Jiang’s gaze was like a sharp sword piercing toward the magistrate. “Lord Liu you want to talk about laws with me? Fine, I’ll talk about laws with you.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Shifting her feet a bit, she lifted her head and spoke, “Which law of the Great Lin dynasty dictates that the family members of the deceased are not allowed to bring them for burial? And which law allows the yamen to hold onto the corpse of the deceased? That skeleton is my husband’s; what’s wrong with me bringing my husband’s remains for a proper burial? Do I need the yamen’s approval for that?”</span><span style>The magistrate was rendered speechless since those laws really didn’t exist!</span><span style>The magistrate was robbed of all his arguments. Now, he didn’t even know how to respond!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu shook her head slightly. </span><i><span style>‘Where was that imposingness from earlier? Why was it gone so quickly?’</span></i><span style> Unable to help it, she flicked her sleeves and stepped forward.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Madame Jiang, I’m afraid you cannot bring the body of the deceased back home, as of right now.” A voice rang out refuting Madame Jiang.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Only now did Madame Jiang notice the “young man” with delicate features and looking like a gentle spring breeze. However, those ink-like eyes gave off an icy cold feeling. “And who might you be?”</span><span style>“This one is a humble painter employed by the yamen. I hope that Madame Jiang might calm down and think this over. Master Jiang died of a violent death, and the murderer has yet to be found. Hence, I am afraid the corpse cannot be returned to you.”</span><span style>Madame Jiang was too used to getting her way. How would she tolerate someone who dared to talk back to her?</span><span style>Her voice rose sharply, “My husband went mad and disappeared that year. Now that I can find his corpse, of course, I want to bring it back! As for the rest, I don’t wish to talk about it. As for dying of a violent death, what is your reason for saying that? That’s simply preposterous.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Though her willowy brows didn’t move much, that aura and presence could easily overwhelm a person.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu replied to her, “Madame Jiang, a murder case is a murder case. Since it happened, the yamen has to solve it. On Master Jiang’s skeleton, there are signs of him being stabbed around 20 times at different places. Besides, looking at his ankle bone, it can be inferred that he received bruising to that area just before he died as well. All of these prove that he got into a struggle with someone before he died; therefore, this means that he was murdered.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Enough!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Madame Jiang waved her long sleeves, her eyes practically spitting fire at Ji Yunshu. She spoke in an extremely unhappy tone, “How do you expect me to believe what came from the mouth of a lowly painter? I’m telling you right now, today I am not going to allow this matter to be investigated any longer. This is, after all, my Jiang family’s private matter. Whether to investigate it or not is up to me.”</span><span style>“You are clearly protecting someone.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Protecting? What nonsense are you spouting?” Madame Jiang became even more agitated.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu spoke forthrightly, “An old man came forward to testify about Master Jiang’s death which he personally witnessed. He has already told me everything and has also agreed to stand witness in court to apprehend the murderer!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Hearing this, the magistrate stepped closer to her and asked, “Yunshu, is this true? Who is the murderer?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu’s gaze looked extremely certain as it met Madame Jiang’s. She spoke, “He told me himself that the murderer was your younger brother, Madame Jiang.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How could I murder my own brother-in-law?” The one who spoke was the man standing beside Madame Jiang. His face appeared anxious as he stepped forward to refute this. Pointing at Ji Yunshu, he continued, “Don’t talk nonsense! I didn’t do it- During the days my brother-in-law went missing, I wasn’t home at all!”</span><span style>Only now did Ji Yunshu carefully examine this person. Her first impression was: sloppy and frivolous!</span><span style>Ji Yunshu persisted, “These words were spoken by that old man. He claimed he witnessed it.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Simply a joke.” Madame Jiang humphed coldly, as she pulled her younger brother behind her. She looked at Ji Yunshu from top to bottom before speaking, “This young sir, should you be speaking the truth, why would that old man tell you who the murderer was in secret and not report it to the yamen? You had better not randomly accuse people. Without evidence, how can you just point out the murderer? Isn’t that ridiculous?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Everything I say is-” Ji Yunshu was cut off halfway.</span><span style>“I believe you must be speaking about Seventh Uncle? Ah what a coincidence, he just so happened to pass away from an illness this morning.”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Hah?!’</span></i><span style> “Dead?” Ji Yunshu was stunned for a moment.</span><i><span style>‘Was he silenced?!’</span></i><i></i><span style>Madame Jiang pressed even further, this time, aiming the spearhead at the magistrate, “Lord Liu, I do not wish to say anymore. Would you please bring my husband’s corpse out and hand it to me, </span><i><span style>immediately</span></i><span style>. I wish to let him be properly buried as soon as possible.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The magistrate spoke, “But there were indeed knife marks on the skeleton.”</span><span style>“Lord Liu must have been unaware that before my husband died, he turned mad and would often stab himself with a dagger. Those marks must have been accumulated over the years and not inflicted by someone else.”</span><span style>“That… After Master Jiang went missing, Madame Jiang, you moved to the capital, but why was his corpse still found under the large tree in your old manor?” Magistrate Liu became suspicious!</span><span style>Madame Jiang was still completely unfazed. She cast a gaze at Ji Yunshu and spoke in a calm tone, “Didn’t this young sir say this before? My husband twisted his ankle when he was alive. Perhaps a few days after we moved to the capital he came back and accidentally twisted his ankle, hitting his head on the tree and ended up dead. That’s a possibility.”</span><i><span style>‘Simply searching for explanations!’ </span></i><span style>The magistrate asked Ji Yunshu in a faint voice, “Was there any blunt trauma to the skull?”</span><span style>She nodded her head. “There is, but the force of the collision would not have been strong enough to be fatal. At most, it would leave a bump.”</span><span style>“Since there was damage to his head, no matter what, I still spoke correctly.” Madame Jiang was just as arrogant as before.</span><span style>Without any new evidence, there was no way to refute. Especially now that “Seventh Uncle” has died!</span><span style>If they couldn’t find any more evidence, that skeleton might really be taken away by Madame Jiang.</span><span style>“What, are you still not willing to hand it over? If I were to make a complaint to the supreme court, I’m afraid you won’t be able to keep that official’s hat of yours any longer, Lord Liu.” Her words were filled with threats.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as her voice settled… “And if this prince does not allow it?”</span> <span style>Jing Rong’s voice resounded from outside the courtroom!</span></p>
