 <p></p>
 <p><span style>It came so abruptly that Ji Yunshu’s brain went blank. Her brain only had the time to register being tightly hugged and her chin being lifted by Jing Rong when they began to kiss. After a moment, she found her back painfully rapping against the uneven rocky wall. It was painful, yet, her body, from head to toe, was almost drowning in the numbness of the kiss. &nbsp;</span><span style>However, a moment later, her brain finally caught up to what was happening. She put all her strength on her palms and forcefully pushed Jing Rong away. “Bastard!” She exploded with foul language.</span><span style>The next moment, she raised her hand to slap Jing Rong. Unfortunately, Jing Rong timely caught her wrist and took the opportunity to pin it above her head. Once again, she was imprisoned in his brutal embrace. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let me go,” bellowed Ji Yunshu, as tears began to pool in her eyes.</span><span style>“Do you dislike me so much?”</span><span style>“Yes!” She answered without hesitation.</span><span style>Jing Rong did not get angry. On the contrary, a smile appeared on his face as if he was admiring a rare sight. He slyly declared, “Right now, we are deep in the mountain and there’s also the possibility that they thought we are dead. And, on such a short notice, Lang Po might not be able to find us.” While he spoke, he shamelessly stuck closer to Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu distanced her head from him and struggled to free herself, but it was useless. She could only give him a roll of the eyes, revealing her grievance with teary eyes. </span><i><span style>‘All men are like this. They are all beasts after taking off their clothes. And Jing Rong is no exception!’ </span></i><span style>Not to mention that the situation right now was indeed disadvantageous for her. They were deep in the mountain, so even if she screamed until her throat was hoarse, no one would help her.</span><span style>Jing Rong smiled while wrinkling his nose as he smelt her neck. “Despite the smell of dirt and mud, your body smells incredibly sweet. It’s really… alluring.”</span><i><span style>‘Damn beast!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Jing Rong, let me go!”</span><span style>“What did you just call me?”</span><span style>“Let go.”</span><span style>“No way!” He put emphasis on his words as the playfulness in his eyes suddenly vanished, replaced by a penetrating and reprobating gaze. Then, his sight stopped lingering on her as he solemnly stated, “You are the one who decided to go to Liang mountain and left me behind without a word. In order to protect you, I even got injured. It’s legitimate that I seek some comfort from you. If there is a next time, I will strip you, throw you on the nuptial bed and do whatever I want.”</span><i><span style>‘Oi! This guy hid such twisted thoughts in his heart and let them brew in him for such a long time!’</span></i><span style> This kind of method of consolation is quite despicable. If she knew earlier, she would not have gone out to search for medicinal herbs for him. She should have let his wound rot! </span><i><span style>‘No, no, no! If something happened to Jing Rong, my conscience will never be in peace.’</span></i><span style>She inclined her head and said, “Since there’s nothing more to say, shouldn’t your Highness let me go?”</span><span style>“Does your back and wrist hurt?”</span><span style>“Yeah…” She nodded. There was no point in lying since it really hurt.</span><span style>Jing Rong carefully examined her. After a bit of pondering, he decided to release her.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, more than a dozen people holding torches rushed inside the cave. In an instant, all the torches flooded the dim cave with light, blinding both Ji Yunshu and Jing Rong.</span><span style>“Your Highness!” Following the crowd’s arrival, Lang Po’s anxious shout was heard.</span><span style>Under the torchlight, Lang Po saw with 100% clarity a scene that made him blush. At this moment, he wished he could drill a hole in the ground and bury himself in it, like a rat escaping into a tunnel. Why? Because the prince he gave his allegiance to was half-naked and pressing a lithe “young man” against the wall, and the distance between them was paper-thin. Although he knew that Ji Yunshu was a woman, she was currently disguised as a man. Not to mention the way she was held by Jing Rong’s muscular arms… Their positions left too much for imagination!</span><span style>The atmosphere turned extremely awkward when everyone realized what was going on. Excluding Lang Po, the imperial guards present only had one thought in their minds: </span><i><span style><span>‘Shit! Could it be that his Highness is a cut-sleeve<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>?’ </span></span></i><span style>All the imperial guards immediately shut their eyes in fear that they saw too much and would have their eyes dug out.</span><span style>As for Ji Yunshu, she simply wanted to knock her head on the wall until she died. The postures of Jing Rong and herself were too ambiguous. It was the first time in her life that she felt so embarrassed that her whole body was boiling like a cooked shrimp.</span></p>
 <p><span style>However, Jing Rong remained as usual. He released Ji Yunshu and stooped down to pick up his clothes. Slowly, he dressed himself, unperturbed and unhurried. Yet, within that calmness, he was exuding a displeased aura. He felt like they were disturbing his sensual dream in the middle of the night.</span><span style>Lang Po bowed his head in apology. “Please forgive me, your Highness. This subordinate was late in rescuing you.”</span><span style>Jing Rong waved his hand, showing that he did not mind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Po raised his eyes and observed his lord. Then, he saw the injuries Jing Rong had. The grip he had on his sword suddenly tightened. “Your Highness, are you injured?”</span><span style>“It’s just a small injury.” As soon as he replied, Jing Rong immediately added, “How did you find me?”</span><span style>“Young Master Li had informed me. However, the topography of this valley is quite complex, so this subordinate…”</span><span style>“Young Master Li?” Jing Rong was puzzled.</span><span style>“Yes, he’s the same Young Master Li who followed us to the capital from Yuzhou.”</span><span style>Jing Rong recalled the situation from earlier. Due to the lack of light in the forest, he only knew there was someone else fighting the assassins, but he could not ascertain their identity. Who could have guessed that the other person was that tag-along from Yuzhou. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Jing Rong’s face turned grave as he looked a Ji Yunshu. He questioned her, “Why did he follow you to Liang mountain?”</span><i></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Big bro, can’t we go back to the main point? Isn’t it more important to hurry up and leave this place?’ </span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu leaned back and spoke carelessly, “A simple coincidence.”</span><span style>“A coincidence?” Jing Rong obviously did not believe her words. His tone took a dangerous turn.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu refused to answer this time. She turned to Lang Po instead. “How is Young Master Li? Is he alright?”</span><span style>Lang Po answered perfunctorily, “He received a serious injury, so I ordered people to send him back to his residence. His life should be in no danger right now.”</span><span style>She nodded.</span><span style>However, she did not notice that Jing Rong was looking at her with defeated eyes. He immediately ordered Lang Po after he finished dressing himself. “Let’s return to the estate. Extinguish the fire and make sure to properly protect Teacher Ji from the beasts roaming inside the forest. Don’t let him get bitten.”</span><span style>“Yes, your Highness!”</span><span style>Jing Rong inquired, “Can you walk?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu nodded.</span><span style>He threw his outer clothing on her. “It’s humid at night.” Immediately after, he walked out of the cave, but after two steps, he halted. With a heavy frown, he looked at Lang Po.</span><span style>Lang Po understood his meaning in an instant. He stepped forward and supported Jing Rong and helped him walk away. In the end, Jing Rong was like a dying duck acting strong. He clearly could not walk due to the injury he received, yet he did not want to let people know. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu draped herself in Jing Rong’s clothing. She took a deep breath before following after the crowd.</span><span style>On their way, several guards protected her from the rear and one on each flank as they feared she might fall or bump into something. If an accident happened to her, his Highness might slaughter them to appease his “boyfriend”.</span></p>
