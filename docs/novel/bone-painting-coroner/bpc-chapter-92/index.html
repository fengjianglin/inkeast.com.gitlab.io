 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>A conjecture took form within Jing Rong’s mind, but he didn’t dare to accept it.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu clenched on Ah Yu’s little hands, her expression solemn.</span><span style>Due to the sensitive nature of the case, her intuition told her that the truth was far from simple. Not to mention the words that Madame Jiang left before… Imperceptibly, she always felt something was wrong from those words.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After she lay back Ah Yu’s hands, she turned to the jailer and instructed him. “Go the yamen immediately and notify Lord Liu to bring the knife that Yu Sao used to commit her crime. In addition, bring me some black ink and flour.”</span><span style>The jailer was bewildered. “Teacher, what are you going to do?”</span><span style>“Hurry and go!”</span><span style>“But… what about the corpse? We still have to send it to the memorial hall.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu fiercely glared at him. “I told you to hurry and do as you are ordered, why are you being so wordy for?”</span><i><span style>‘Aiya!’</span></i><span style> The jailer shivered from fear and hurriedly bent down to signify that he accepted the order and ran away.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu sighed while looking at the lifeless Ah Yu. Her heart was extremely heavy.</span><span style>None of her expression was missed by Jing Rong.</span><span style>He asked her, “Are you suspecting that Ah Yu is the real murderer?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu shook her head. “I am not certain. I hope that my guess is wrong.”</span><span style>Jing Rong analyzed the situation. “Two years ago, she was only six years old. How can a six-year-old child kill a man in his forties?”</span><span style>This kind of misgiving should be put asides. However… </span><span style>Ji Yunshu squinted her eyes. “Your Highness, did you forget? When Lord Jiang was pushed by Li Zhao, he sprained his ankle. He shouldn’t be able to get up easily and since Ah Yu was only six years old, there was no need for Lord Jiang to guard himself against her which gave her the opportunity to kill him.” She immediately added, “But all of this is only my conjecture. It is but a possibility.”</span><span style>Jing Rong nodded and stopped asking questions.</span><span style>Not long after, Magistrate Liu arrived, looking worn out in his official uniform, but when he saw Jing Rong, he greeted him while shivering like usual.</span><span style>“Your Highness, this is the prison. For you to be here, I’m afraid that your precious and noble body…”</span><span style>Jing Rong raised his hand to interrupt him. “The case is more urgent. There’s no need to attend to me.”</span><span style>“Y-y-yes…”</span><span style>The Magistrate rose and walked to Ji Yunshu. He waved at a runner who stepped forward to give her the things that she had asked for.</span><span style>“Are there new elements pertaining the case? Didn’t you already examine the knife?” The Magistrate was puzzled.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu didn’t plan to discuss long with him. She put on her gloves and took the knife and burned the wooden handle using the flame of the oil lamp. Then, she instructed a runner. “Add the flour to the black ink and stir it until the texture is uniform.”</span><span style>“Yes sir.” The runner did as told and after he was done mixing, he gave it to Ji Yunshu.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu dipped the handle with the flour and ink mixture. After half the time it took to brew a cup of tea had passed, she pulled out the handle. The handle was now black and sticky.</span><span style>Once again, she cooked the handle above the flame.</span><span style>Meanwhile, everyone was looking at her with bewilderment on their faces.</span><span style>What was Teacher Ji doing?</span><span style>Eight pairs of eyes were observing the knife in her hand.</span><span style>As everyone continued to stare, the black flour paste started to peel off by itself under the high temperature of the flame. Finally, only several distinctive marks were left on the handle.</span><span style>No one but Ji Yunshu understood the significance of those marks. With the appearance of those marks, her eyes were misted with an expression that left people unable to decipher her mood.</span><span style>The Magistrate took the initiative to ask. “How could this be? Is there something special about this knife?”</span><span style>“Hmmm.” She nodded.</span><span style>“What is wrong with it?”</span><span style>“Everything is wrong.”</span><span style>Her words baffled Liu Qingping.</span><span style>She moved the handle away from the flame. Then, she put Ah Yu’s left hand around the handle and made the corpse grip the handle before releasing the hand.</span><span style>“It completely fits!” Ji Yunshu declared in a confident tone. “The one who killed Lord Jiang is Ah Yu!”</span><i><span style>Wooaah!</span></i><span style>Everyone was flabbergasted, except for Jing Rong who remained calm. He asked her. “How did you determine it?”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu raised the knife handle and began to explain. “There are marks on the handle. Those are fingerprints.”</span><span style>“Fingerprint?” The Magistrate stepped forward and carefully examined the fingerprints. “But how did the fingerprints show up there?”</span><span style>“They appeared because Ah Yu gripped on the handle at the time of the murder. When she stabbed the victim, her small hand only occupied a small space. Therefore, it was obvious enough from the placement of the fingerprints. What’s more, when she committed her crime, the whole knife was plunged into the victim, and blood was sprayed, covering the whole weapon, except on the areas where Ah Yu gripped the handle.”</span><span style>Everyone looked at each other. They appeared to understand some of the explanations, but not all of it.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu continued to explain. “I covered the handle with an ink and flour mixture, then heated it. By doing that, the blood will be absorbed by the mixture and fall off. Whereas the mixture would continue to stick to areas where there aren’t any blood, thereby leaving marks - the fingerprints - that you see.”</span><span style>“Oh! So it was like that!” The Magistrate nodded, but after thinking again, he felt extremely baffled. “But the fingerprints could have belonged to Yu Sao, no?”</span><span style>“Impossible.” Ji Yunshu rejected the idea.</span><span style>“Yunshu, Madame Jiang had said it herself that she saw Yu Sao killing Lord Jiang. She confessed to her crime, so it shouldn’t be wrong.”</span><span style>“But Yu Sao didn’t admit to committing the murder.”</span><span style>“The woman is crazy. How can she admit her crime?!” Magistrate Liu spreaded out his hand to stress his words.</span><span style>Jing Rong glanced over, his cold eyes piercing through the Magistrate. He also reprimanded him. “Lord Liu, it’s best if you calm down a bit.”</span><span style>“...” The Magistrate’s expression became stiff as he smiled awkwardly while nodding and closing his mouth. He couldn’t say anything and was greatly suffering from Jing Rong’s rebuke.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu slowly explained again. “I have all the evidence and evidence is everything. The fingerprints on the handle completely fit Ah Yu’s fingers, and they even have the same length. Not to mention that the position of the hand corresponded to that of a left-hander. For a left-handed person, their pinky, along with the other fingers will grip the handle in the opposite position from a right-handed person. In the case of a reverse grip, their thumb will be situated on the right side of the handle, as opposed to a right-handed person where their thumb will instead be on the left side. In addition, the four other fingers will be opposite to the thumb, be it the left hand or right hand.”</span><span style>“As for the fingers’ positions on this handle, it clearly shows the person who held it was left handed.” Ji Yunshu lifted Ah Yu’s left hand and continued. “Ah Yu’s left palm had a thick layer of callus with well-defined palm lines. As for her right hand, it’s extremely soft. In other words, Ah Yu is left-handed and she used that very hand to hold the knife that stabbed Lord Jiang.”</span><span style>This was something quite unbelievable. Two years ago, Ah Yu was only six years old! What could such a child go through that would force her to kill at such a tender age?!</span><span style>It made everyone sigh endlessly.</span><span style>Provided that Ji Yunshu said was true, then what really happened in the end?</span><span style>Suddenly, an outrageous conjecture wormed its way in her mind. The simple idea of it was so abominable that it scared her, causing her to suddenly tremble.</span><span style>Jing Rong watched her expression and inquired. “Did you think of something?”</span><span style>“I want to see Yu Sao again.”</span><span style>“But…”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu interrupted his words.</span><span style>“I won’t go into the cell. I’m just going to stay outside.”</span><span style>She was able to see that Jing Rong was worried about her.</span><span style>Jing Rong nodded. “Alright. Let me accompany you.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu refused. “No. Stay here. It’s better if you don’t come. I want to discuss this with her… alone.” Without waiting for Jing Rong’s reply, she took the knife and walked toward Yu Sao’s prison cell.</span><span style>Everyone followed behind her until they arrived to a hidden corner at a junction where they stopped and didn’t approach further.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu stood outside the cell. In her hand, she held the murder weapon. She approached near the wooden stakes and knocked on it.</span><span style>The knocking sound was very dull and heavy, the resonation seemed as if it was directly knocking into the mind and soul.</span><span style>She did it on purpose. After a moment passed, Yu Sao, whose back was facing her, slowly turned around. Her eyes overcasted and bloodshot, appearing extremely dreadful!</span></p>
 <p><span style>Strangely, Ji Yunshu smiled and said, “Silently loving a person… That kind of feeling is very exciting, making you feel that everything you did for him was worth it, and those you don’t like should just go to hell. Am I right?” Her words were directed to Yu Sao.</span><span style>Following that, Yu Sao simply replied, “Right.”</span><i><span style>‘Very good!’</span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu continued to speak. “Obviously, it was someone you like, but someone else snatched him. The feeling is certainly unbearable. Am I right?”</span><span style>“Right.”</span><span style>“So, Yu Sao, don’t you hate Ah Yu very much?” Ji Yunshu suddenly asked.</span><i><span style>‘Hum? Hate? Where did that come from?’</span></i><span style>Unexpectedly, Yu Sao smiled, looking more mad with her hands grabbing her disheveled hair while she gave a genuine and honest smile at the same time. She spoke. “She is my Ah Yu. Why should I hate her?”</span><span style>“Because she snatched your man.”</span><i><span style>Huh?!</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Following Ji Yunshu’s words, Yu Sao suddenly ferociously leapt up from the ground. Her smile twisted into a malevolent and insane one. Hatred suffused into the look she gave Ji Yunshu. She roared, “No one can take him from me! NO ONE!”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu continued to provoke Yu Sao. “Doesn’t that mean he doesn’t love you? He loved Ah Yu. He embraced Ah Yu. He forced himself on her every time because he wanted her. He wanted to possess her. Yet, he doesn’t love you; he never wanted you.”</span><span style>“Shut up! SHUT UP!” Yu Sao suddenly dashed forward and ruthlessly slammed onto wooden stakes of the prison cell. Her arms stretched with force through the wooden barrier of the cell as she attempted to grab Ji Yunshu’s neck.</span><span style>It was a good thing that Ji Yunshu had already retreated a few steps when she saw Yu Sao’s mad rush towards her.</span><span style>Seeing that her hands was clawing the empty air, Yu Sao became enraged. She screamed in her mad frenzy, “Don’t you dare say that! DON’T YOU DARE! He loves me! He loves me!”</span><span style>The expression on the hidden crowd changed. </span><i><span style>‘That ‘he’ is Lord Jiang? So, the person Yu Sao loved is Lord Jiang!’</span></i><span style>The answer that Ji Yunshu wanted to know had been forced out from Yu Sao’s mouth. Her heart painfully ached at the confirmation of the truth. Tears gradually pooled in her eyes as she looked at this inhuman woman in front of her. </span></p>
 <p><span style>She shook her head. Her voice was filled with sorrow as she vented, “She is your daughter! Just because you love Lord Jiang, you let Ah Yu endured his tortures each and every time he willed it. You even… harbor a grudge against her because she killed him. You confined her in that stinky little room and chained her to iron shackles! You fed her excrements and tortured her until she was more broken, no longer human, nothing but a tortured soul! Even to her last breath, she knew no peace! This was your revenge! You want to avenge Lord Jiang. You took revenge against your own biological daughter!”</span></p>

 <p>Conclusion: What is justice? And Madame Jiang is not such a bad person for lying about Yu Sao being the murderer. Although at this point, we pretty understand that lots of characters in this novel are portrayed as grey, not completely black or white.</p>
 <p>Meh... It was a bad idea to check around the cooking blog "<a href="http://thewoksoflife.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Woks of Life</a>" It's making me hungry and I want to spend a whole week in close-door meditation in the kitchen, trying to gain a breakthrough into the dao of cooking.</p>
