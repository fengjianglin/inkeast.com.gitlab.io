 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Concubine Xiao had issued a decree for seemingly no reason. Ji Yunshu grudgingly accepted the summon. “I shall obey!” </span><span style>The palace servants left to report the completion of their tasks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu looked at Jing Rong. “Today is the day when Qujiang’s general entered the palace. I wonder what are Concubine Xiao’s intentions in summoning me into the palace?”</span><span style>“If you are reluctant to go, then don’t. This Prince will cover for you.”</span><span style>“There is no need for that. She might want to discuss the missing girls case.”</span><span style>“Can you deal with her?” Jing Rong asked.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu became hesitant. She said, “I can more or less cope with her. Well, last time, I did come out from the palace alive.”</span><span style>Suddenly, Jing Rong frowned and sternly said, “This time, we enter the imperial palace together. If you dare to leave first like last time, leaving this Prince behind, see how I will deal with you.”</span><i><span style>‘Oops!’ </span></i><span style>She made a faux pas. Jing Rong looked straight into her eyes with an intense gaze that showed just how serious he was. It caused Ji Yunshu to instinctively retreat back a step while nodding. She promised. “If I am late and cannot leave on time, your Highness doesn’t need to wait for me.”</span><span style>Jing Rong understood her meaning. His expression suddenly turned slightly cold and oppressive. He said to her, “If Concubine Xiao dares to confine you within the palace, this Prince will rush in her palace hall with my people. Carving out a trail of blood if I have to.</span><i><span style>‘I’m blushing from shame! Do you have to be so violent?’</span></i><span style> Ji Yunshu was rendered speechless by Jing Rong.</span><span style>“After we’ve entered the palace, I will arrange for several eunuchs to protect you. They will be around Concubine Xiao’s palace hall. If something happens, they can immediately notify me.” Jing Rong added.</span><span style>“It’s not necessary!”</span><span style>“It is necessary!” His attitude was very resolute. </span></p>
 <p><span style>They no longer delayed and immediately went to board the carriage. However, Wei Yi rushed out. He tightly grabbed onto Ji Yunshu’s arm and refused to let go no matter what.</span><span style>“Shu’er, let’s go together!” He pitifully said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wei Yi, I am not going out to play. Be obedient and stay here. I will return very quickly.”</span><span style>Wei Yi shook his head.</span><span style>“Listen to me!”</span><span style>He shook his head again.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu wanted to stretch out her other hand to free herself from his grip, but Wei Yi suddenly said, “I will not let go of Shu’er’s arm. Because if I let go, I won’t be able to see you again. I am scared! I am scared that I can’t see Shu’er!”</span><i><span style>‘Eh!’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Wei Yi…”</span><span style>“Shu’er, let’s go together. Is it alright?”</span><span style>Jing Rong’s voice was suddenly heard from the carriage. “Climb in, and take him along!”</span><span style>Hearing that, Wei Yi became happy. He hurriedly squeezed into the carriage while shouting several times “You are great, Big Brother!” However, as Ji Yunshu got on the carriage, she glared at Jing Rong. He squinted his eyes to look at her and lazily said, “He wants to go, so let him go.”</span><span style>“It’s the imperial palace!” Ji Yunshu reminded him.</span><span style>“This Prince knows!” He lightly replied.</span><span style>Ji Yunshu insisted on keeping him safe. She looked at Wei Yi. “Wei Yi, go back.”</span><span style>“Shu’er…”</span><span style>“Go back!”</span><span style>Wei Yi lowered his head and knew that Ji Yunshu was angry. He reached for her sleeve and tugged at it. “Shu’er, don’t be angry. I’m going back.” He looked extremely pitiful with his lowered head.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing Wei Yi’s pitiful appearance, Ji Yunshu’s heart could hardly bear it. </span><i><span style>‘Wei Yi, be patient until I’m done with the Lin Capital case. I promise you that when everything is done, I’ll accompany you more often.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>After Wei Yi got off the carriage, Jing Rong suddenly lifted the curtain and ordered Lang Po, “I don’t need you to go to the palace with me. Take care of Wei Yi. Bring him to eat what he likes and play with him until he is happy.”</span><span style>“Yes, your Highness!”</span><span style>After he lowered the curtain, he looked back at Ji Yunshu with a solemn expression and expressed his thoughts, “Since he wants to come, why are you so adamant in your refusal?”</span><span style>“I am not your Highness. I have no way of rescuing others from danger if something does happen.”</span><span style>“Why would you say so?”</span><span style>“Wei Yi shouldn’t be involved in these muddled matters.”</span><span style>Her reply was very concise, so Jing Rong no longer had a reason to dig further. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Wei Yi watched the carriage gradually getting further away, disappearing into the distance. He was pouting whilst sitting on the stairs in front of the estate. His feet were continuously drawing circles on the ground.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Po approached him and spoke to him in a soft and fawning tone, “Young Master Wei, how about going with me to eat tanghulu?”</span><span style>Wei Yi shook his head. “I don’t want. I want to wait here until Shu’er comes back.”</span><span style>“Isn’t better if we go in?”</span><span style>“I said no! I’m waiting here.”</span><i><span style>‘How headstrong!’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Young Master Wei…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lang Po was interrupted by Wei Yi. He pouted his mouth, then teardrops fell down from his glistening eyes. He raised his head and looked straight at Lang Po as he asked, “Do you think that Shu’er hates me?”</span><span style>His question came abruptly, catching Lang Po off guard. The corner of his mouth twitched. If someone asked him about anything related to the military, it would not be a problem for him to answer, but to ask him about matters of the heart, he was truly lost. He shrugged and felt helpless. “Young Master Wei, you are making thing difficult for me.”</span><span style>Wei Yi lowered his head and watched his own cleaned shoes that continued circling the dirt on the ground.</span><span style>……..........</span><span style>After entering the Imperial Palace, Jing Rong hastily went to the hall where the negotiations would take place. Before he left, he nagged her over and over again to be careful. She repeatedly nodded at him. The same palace maid who welcomed her last time was there guide her to Zhangzhi hall once more. What caused Ji Yunshu to be surprised was the announcement of her arrival, even a seat was arranged for her in the main room. Some seats were occupied by gorgeously dressed young ladies, and each one of those ladies is considered to be a beauty with their own standard.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ji Yunshu was puzzled. </span><i><span style>‘What kind of drugs did Concubine Xiao take?’</span></i><span style>Those women watched as she arrived, looking at the half-mask upon her face that gave her a touch of mystery. All of them showed curiosity towards her and sized her up.</span><span style>They all wondered if she was beautiful or ugly underneath that mask. What’s more, some of them lowered their heads bashfully. Others would blush at the mere sight of her, while a few would smile at her coquettishly, and the rest were biting their lips, wishing they had the courage to throw themselves in her arms. </span><span style>Was this the effect of solving the missing girls case? It unexpectedly gave her quite a bit of renown and attracted numerous butterflies. She quickly avoided looking straight at those flirty and charming gazes and walked to the middle of the room. She clasped her hand and courteously saluted. “Greetings Concubine Xiao!”</span><span style>Concubine Xiao showed an amiable expression full of smiles. Her tone was gentle when she spoke. “Teacher Ji, you don’t need to be so polite. I have set up a small feast for Teacher. I hope you won’t blame me for taking the initiative.”</span><i><span style>‘Ah? You’re setting a feast for me? What is this situation?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“This humble one failed to understand your Ladyship’s meaning.”</span><span style>“You have solved the missing girls case. The whole capital knows that you are a prodigy, and many of our young ladies admire you. This Palace was thinking that since you will need to marry sooner or later, why not gather the talented ladies from scholarly and reputable families today. I believe that their abilities could be a good match with yours.”</span><i><span style>‘What?’ </span></i><span style>Concubine Xiao was acting as</span> <span style>Ji Yunshu’s matchmaker. Ji Yunshu’s palms became laced with sweat. </span><i><span style>‘What is that woman wanting to do?’</span></i><span style>Ji Yunshu bowed. “Many thanks for her Ladyship’s kind intentions. This humble one is born in a humble home and does not dare to overstep one’s status.”</span><span style>“Since ancient times, people haven’t feared the bitter cold, they instead only fear the Wisemans heartlessness. Teacher has my utmost admiration. Since you have solved the case, the emperor has highly praised you. In the future, your career will progress by leaps and bounds.”</span><span style>“Your Ladyship overpraises me. This humble one appreciates your kindness. As for my career, it is too early to say.”</span><span style>She declined Concubine Xiao’s invitation to her camp again.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The corner of Concubine Xiao dropped a little, yet she still patiently spoke. “Don’t be too anxious to decline this Palace. Take a seat and let’s chat.”</span><span style>Ji Yunshu had no other alternative. She had entered too deeply into the tiger’s cave and couldn’t easily escape.</span></p>
 <p><span style>She sat down while feeling uncomfortable under the curious and longing gaze affixed to her body. Suddenly, she heard a voice. “Teacher Ji’s appearance is generous and you are also blessed with a clever mind. Your face must be magnificent. Why don’t you take off your mask?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>The women at the feast all nodded in agreement while imagining her looks. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Concubine Xiao inwardly laughed sinisterly. She immediately followed suit. “Since everyone agreed, why don’t you take off your mask?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>It actually turned out to be a banquet of schemes.</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grenn's Rants Corner</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p>Concubine Xiao is too devious. Her schemes ran very deep. Pretending to be ignorant of Ji Yunshu's gender, planning a matchmaking party and forcing her to take out her mask. I don't think it is as simple as revealing her gender to the public.</p>
