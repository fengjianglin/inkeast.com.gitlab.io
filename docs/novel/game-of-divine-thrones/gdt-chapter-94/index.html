 <p>‘It’s Saint Sophia.’</p>
 <p>Although he didn’t know what she truly looked like, his instincts told him it was her.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk was about to talk to her, when Martinus stopped him.</p>
 <p>“It’ll be problematic if you talk to her now.”</p>
 <p>“Why?”</p>
 <p>“Sophia isn’t ready.”</p>
 <p>He was telling Woohyuk to wait for the incident to occur and to spectate only.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk nodded and stared at Sophia.</p>
 <p>‘Seems like she’s waiting for someone.’</p>
 <p>He could see the expectation glittering in her eyes. She was most likely waiting for a lover or a crush. That didn’t mean that it couldn’t be a friend she hadn’t seen in a while.</p>
 <p>“What did you mean by the divine lineage earlier?”</p>
 <p>“Exactly what it says. Figure out the details for yourself in the future.”</p>
 <p>Martinus did not tell Woohyuk all the information he needed, showing that his trust for Woohyuk wasn’t strong enough yet.</p>
 <p>“Are you talking about the Sangreal Chronicles?”</p>
 <p>“...Well, you could say so.”</p>
 <p>Martinus was dumbfounded for a moment due to the vast knowledge Woohyuk had about Eteria Rodinus.</p>
 <p>However that only lasted for an instant.</p>
 <p>Martinus soon regained his calm mind and pointed in a direction.</p>
 <p>“There comes Roland.”</p>
 <p>An indigo-haired knight.</p>
 <p>He happily waved his hand in the air once he noticed Sophia.</p>
 <p>“What is their relationship?”</p>
 <p>“It’s slightly unclear, but it would be accurate to call them lovers.”</p>
 <p>Roland was the commander of the Trinity Knight Order, a group of knights who helped Eteria Rodinus in Port Delphoa.</p>
 <p>He began walking away with Saint Sophia, and Woohyuk asked another question.</p>
 <p>“Shouldn’t we follow them?”</p>
 <p>“Let them spend some time together. We need to go this way.”</p>
 <p>Martinus answered as he gestured in the other direction.</p>
 <p>On top of the hill was a magnificent structure made of white marble.</p>
 <p>“Is it the academy?”</p>
 <p>“Indeed. That’s our base of operations.”</p>
 <p>The secret base where the members of Eteria Rodinus encrypted their ancient books and documents.</p>
 <p>However, after the attacks committed by the fanatics, the building and base were burnt down to the ground.</p>
 <p>Thankfully, before that event transpired, most of the ancient documents were transported across the sea to a secret location.</p>
 <p>“Then did Pronoia manage to steal some of the documents?”</p>
 <p>“Not just them. Many other groups with evil intentions plundered our ancient books.</p>
 <p>The main group to do so was the Golden Rose Society.</p>
 <p>To gain the secret knowledge of the gods, they had cooperated with demons.</p>
 <p>‘As I thought, there were demons helping them behind the scenes.’</p>
 <p>He had heard of some uncertain information in the past while investigating the Golden Rose Society.</p>
 <p>The rumors said that they began participating in evil rituals after meeting and cooperating with the Witch Cult.</p>
 <p>However, there was no conclusive evidence to back these rumors.</p>
 <p>“What would happen if they manage to decode those stolen documents?”</p>
 <p>“The Eeth Continent will fall into chaos unlike anything it had seen before.”</p>
 <p>Many of the secret knowledge could cause massive disasters if put in the wrong hands.</p>
 <p>That was the reason why Eteria Rodinus had encrypted the documents and hidden them away.</p>
 <p>“So the main mission of the group is to keep the secret of Rosa Eterna from spreading.”</p>
 <p>“Nobody outside Eteria Rodinus can learn the language.”</p>
 <p>They couldn’t teach Rosa Eterna even if they got captured and tortured by enemies.</p>
 <p>In the past, Saint Sophia did not reveal the secrets as she got brutally tortured by Pronoia, and the group never managed to decode the ancient documents they had stolen.</p>
 <p>‘I’m learning quite a lot right now.’</p>
 <p>By observing Martinus’ imaginary world, he could potentially learn a clue about the whereabouts of the Sangreal Chronicles.</p>
 <p>He could also figure out how to get in touch with Eteria Rodinus.</p>
 <p>As he sorted his thoughts out and walked with Martinus,</p>
 <p>‘Hm?’</p>
 <p>He sensed a group of people following him.</p>
 <p>Instead of turning around to check these individuals, Woohyuk stared at Mertinus.</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p>“So you’ve noticed. They are minions of the Golden Rose Society.”</p>
 <p>The Golden Rose Society was obsessively chasing after Eteria Rodinus with the help of demons.</p>
 <p>In a way, they were even more annoying to deal with compared to Pronoia.</p>
 <p>Since they couldn’t leave those minions alone, Martinus began walking towards an alley with few people.</p>
 <p>And soon enough…</p>
 <p><em>Boom! Crash! Crash!</em></p>
 <p>The two followers were lifted in the air with the use of magic and were slammed against the wall several times without mercy.</p>
 <p>“Urgh…”</p>
 <p>“Keuk…”</p>
 <p>The two men’s eyes were rolled back as they let out painful groans.</p>
 <p>After dropping the men on the ground, Martinus spoke to Woohyuk.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you do the interrogation? I’ll be watching on the side.”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p>This was also part of the trial.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk picked up one of the men and grabbed him by the collar.</p>
 <p>“Who sent you guys?”</p>
 <p>“I, I can’t answer that.”</p>
 <p>A typical response.</p>
 <p>They were reluctant to confess due to their fear of the Golden Rose Society.</p>
 <p>But that didn’t mean that Woohyuk would be considerate and merciful for them.</p>
 <p><em>Slit!</em></p>
 <p>Woohyuk cut the man’s throat with the Vampiric Dagger.</p>
 <p>“Argh…”</p>
 <p>Soon, he couldn’t even make a groan and breathed his last.</p>
 <p>“...!!”</p>
 <p>The other minion who was observing the scene began to tremble in fear.</p>
 <p>“Will you also keep your mouth shut?”</p>
 <p>“N-no. I’ll tell you everything I know, so please spare me…”</p>
 <p>He quickly showed his obedience due to the death of his partner he had witnessed.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk was satisfied. He dragged the man towards Martinus.</p>
 <p>“Is this fine?”</p>
 <p>“You used quite the extreme method.”</p>
 <p>“I’m not the type to show mercy to my enemies.”</p>
 <p>He also didn’t plan to compromise or cooperate with the Golden Rose Society.</p>
 <p>The chances of them selling wildfire to Woohyuk was currently zero.</p>
 <p>During the affair with the Cohen Merchant Group, Woohyuk realized the current objective of the Golden Rose Society. Meanwhile, he himself had become a person of interest to the society members.</p>
 <p>‘This place may be a fictional world, but I still won’t change my ways.’</p>
 <p>He hadn’t actually returned in time to Port Delphoa in the era before the War of Gods and Demons.</p>
 <p>This was just a stage Martinus had prepared for Woohyuk to challenge the trials.</p>
 <p>“Either way, that was good. Better than those whose beliefs prevent them from committing such acts.”</p>
 <p>Martinus nodded with acceptance as he watched Woohyuk’s clear eyes.</p>
 <p>The regressor was one step closer to the old man’s heart.</p>
 <p>“This isn’t the end, right?”</p>
 <p>“Of course. Have him lead you the way.”</p>
 <p>He was telling Woohyuk to find the Golden Rose Society’s base of operations in Port Delphoa.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk stood behind the minion and kept his Vampiric Dagger pointed at his back.</p>
 <p>“Lead the way.”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p>The man’s face was white as a sheet.</p>
 <p>***</p>
 <p>The base was located in the residential area.</p>
 <p>There was an uproar when Woohyuk and Martinus entered the stone structure.</p>
 <p>“In, intruders!”</p>
 <p>“Keep your calm! There are only 2 of them!”</p>
 <p>The ground floor was mostly filled with mercenaries, around 30 of them.</p>
 <p>While they greatly outnumbered the duo, they weren’t a match in terms of fighting prowess.</p>
 <p><em>Slash!</em></p>
 <p><em>Slash!</em></p>
 <p>Woohyuk swiftly slaughtered the mercenaries by wielding Grandia.</p>
 <p>Martinus was participating in the battle as least as possible.</p>
 <p>He only faced the enemies who attacked him first.</p>
 <p>“They, they’re too strong!”</p>
 <p>“What do we do?”</p>
 <p>As the one-sided battle continued, the mercenaries were losing their morale.</p>
 <p>At that moment, the voice of a young man resounded from the top of the stairs.</p>
 <p>“What’s all the fuss? I’m certain I asked everyone to stay quiet within the building.”</p>
 <p>“Sir, Sir Aleister…”</p>
 <p>Aleister Crowley was the young man’s name.</p>
 <p>Not only was he the head of the GOlden Rose Society, he was also a genius alchemist whose skills were unparalleled.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk was somewhat knowledgeable about him thanks to Martinus’ explanations.</p>
 <p>“Are you the alchemist who sold his soul to the devil?”</p>
 <p>“That’s me. And who are you? Since you’re with the White Sage, are you part of Eteria Rodinus?”</p>
 <p>“Let’s just say that I’m a mercenary who was commissioned.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk spoke emotionlessly as he brandished Grandia.</p>
 <p>Aleister made a sly smile as he watched the intruders.</p>
 <p>“An outsider… You must be feeling desperate these days, Martinus. Or is it that you’re planning some scheme?”</p>
 <p>“Who knows? That’s a hard question to answer. In any case, your opponent is this young man.”</p>
 <p>Martinus pointed at Woohyuk with his cane.</p>
 <p>As he stepped back, Aleister observed Woohyuk as he summoned Abyssal Spears in the air.</p>
 <p>“Aren’t you a demon? I don’t know why you’re helping Eteria Rodinus, but I’ll have to kill you right now.”</p>
 <p>“Nonsense. The only one dying today is you.”</p>
 <p>“Let’s see how long you can keep that show of pride and confidence.”</p>
 <p>The Abyssal Spears ripped through the air and flew towards Woohyuk’s head.</p>
 <p>He immediately expanded the demonic energy within him outside and absorbed the overwhelming attack approaching him.</p>
 <p>“Is that it?”</p>
 <p>“...How problematic. Are you a Demon King? There shouldn’t be many being who are able to block my spells so easily.”</p>
 <p>“No need to know.”</p>
 <p>“Oh dear oh dear… I can’t comprehend how things have escalated like this. A demon king… I will have to use my full power to win against you.”</p>
 <p>Aleister was already considering Woohyuk as a demon king.</p>
 <p>With a spooky look, he raised his staff high in the air.</p>
 <p><em>Kuoooo!</em></p>
 <p>A pitch-black magic sigil appeared on the floor and a dark vortex began spinning around it.</p>
 <p>‘A summoning spell.’</p>
 <p>Taking Aleister’s skills into account, a high-level demon would most likely be summoned.</p>
 <p>The situation would get complicated if left alone.</p>
 <p>Once he made his plan, Woohyuk took out Verserios.</p>
 <p>“You should stop your petty tricks and worry about your life now, Aleister.”</p>
 <p>“Oho, is that your exclusive weapon? It’s quite gorgeous. It almost looks like the abyss of origin.”</p>
 <p>Aleister ecstatically observed Verserios, his eyes filled with greed.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk took advantage of the short instant when Aleister let down his guard and reduced the distance between them.</p>
 <p>And then…</p>
 <p><em>Slash!</em></p>
 <p>He swung his sword horizontally and severed this opponent in half.</p>
 <p>‘Hm…?’</p>
 <p>After verifying Aleister’s insides, a deep frown appeared on his face.</p>
 <p>The bisected part revealed dark insides. Blood and flesh were nowhere to be seen, and only pitch darkness was visible.</p>
 <p>“Aha, don’t be too surprised. I’m a little bit different from ordinary people.”</p>
 <p>“Just what are you?”</p>
 <p>“The human who was closest to finding the world’s origin? Well, that sounds about right.”</p>
 <p>The severed Aleister’s lips curled upwards.</p>
 <p>Immediately, an enormous black snake’s head emerged from the magic sigil on the floor.</p>
 <p>Leviathan. It was a mythical monster rumored to live in the Abyss.</p>
 <p>‘It’s already too late.’</p>
 <p>If such a monster were successfully summoned in the middle of a city, there would be enormous casualties and deaths amongst the innocent citizens.</p>
 <p>Although he was merely in a fictional world, this was also part of Martinus’ trial.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk turned around and performed a downward slash with Verserios at the leviathan’s head.</p>
 <p><em>Stab!</em></p>
 <p>With a dull sound, dark energy began to spill out of the monster’s wound.</p>
 <p>But that was the extent of the injury.</p>
 <p>Due to its incredible size, the leviathan hadn’t even flinched at the attack.</p>
 <p>“Since it’s come to this, let’s offer the entire population of Port Delphoa as sacrifices, including you, the members of Eteria Rodinus!”</p>
 <p>Aleister, who had somehow returned to his previous form, snickered audibly.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk ignored him and began to ponder on how to defeat the leviathan before him.</p>
 <p>‘The only way is to destroy the magic sigil.’</p>
 <p>It would take far too long to suppress the leviathan. Even Aleister wouldn’t just sit still watching Woohyuk defeat the monster.</p>
 <p>He could only try to send it back to the Abyss before the summoning would become complete.</p>
 <p>As he laid out his options in his head, Woohyuk jumped off of the gargantuan monster’s head and…</p>
 <p><em>Boom!</em></p>
 <p>Swung Verserios down to the floor and destroyed the jet black magic sigil.</p>
