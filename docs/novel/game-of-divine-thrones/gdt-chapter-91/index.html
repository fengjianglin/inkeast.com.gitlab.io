 <p>[Holy Spell: Spiritual Barrier].</p>
 <p>A protective barrier spell highly efficient against demons. However, it was of low quality. It wouldn’t manage to block an executive of the Witch Cult.</p>
 <p>If he was boasting with confidence due to this spell, Shin Dong-il’s plan was bound to fail.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk clicked his tongue when a maid rushed into the office.</p>
 <p>“Mi, Milord! It’s an emergency!”</p>
 <p>“What happened?”</p>
 <p>“The guards outside the mansion are fighting against each other!”</p>
 <p>“...What?”</p>
 <p>Count Oswald nervously looked out the window.</p>
 <p>The sun had already set.</p>
 <p>It was difficult to differentiate the silhouettes in the dark.</p>
 <p>“Just leave them be, Sir. It may be a trap.”</p>
 <p>“Hm… I understand.”</p>
 <p>Count Oswald nodded at Shin Dong-il’s words. He coughed and gave the maid an order.</p>
 <p>“Go outside and check what’s happening. And tell the guards inside the mansion not to step outside.”</p>
 <p>“Yes? Yes…”</p>
 <p>The maid exited the office as white as a sheet.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk made a troubled look as he watched the maid.</p>
 <p>‘Did she change her plan?’</p>
 <p>According to the information he had gathered, this kind of event had never happened before.</p>
 <p>The only strategy she had used until now was manipulating the shadows.</p>
 <p>The shadow killer had always attacked the targeted nobles without laying a hand on the others around them.</p>
 <p>‘She must’ve been spying inside the mansion.’</p>
 <p>The shadow killer had most likely noticed his presence in the mansion.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk spread his senses and scanned his surroundings.</p>
 <p>“We should cast the barrier before it’s too late. We don’t know when your shadows will begin moving, Count.”</p>
 <p>“I agree. It should be better than using nothing.”</p>
 <p>A magic sigil appeared on the ground when Shin Dong-il tore the scroll and a spheric barrier was cast around them.</p>
 <p>However, it’s radius was quite small, and only a few people could fit inside.</p>
 <p>“Did you not bring any item that could be of help?”</p>
 <p>“Maybe. Will this do?”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk took out a Saint’s Potion from his pocket. By consuming it, one’s resistance to status conditions would increase by 25% for an hour.</p>
 <p>Shin Dong-il snickered as he recognized the potion.</p>
 <p>“The count and I already drank that even before you arrived in the office.”</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll use it myself.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk poured the potion on the floor as if he had expected that reaction and began drawing a difficult spell.</p>
 <p>Then, the spiritual barrier was surrounded by blue flames and took a more distinct and solid appearance.</p>
 <p>[The reinforcement technique has strengthened the spiritual barrier by one stage.]</p>
 <p>[The duration is proportional to the amount of the material used.]</p>
 <p>“Wait, are you an enchanter?”</p>
 <p>“No. It’s a spell that I came across.”</p>
 <p>During the past 40 years, Woohyuk had gained a lot of information and skills.</p>
 <p>He knew the basic equipment production methods and alchemy recipes without even having a blacksmith or alchemist class.</p>
 <p>He could also use reinforcement techniques without being an enchanter.</p>
 <p>“Why don’t you join our clan? It would be beneficial to you in a lot of ways.”</p>
 <p>“...Let’s keep that talk for later.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk coldly evaded the topic Shin Dong-il had brought up.</p>
 <p>He did not want to get involved with a clan that would drag an injured girl and ‘use’ her as a playtoy.</p>
 <p>‘Tch, what’s with his arrogant attitude?’</p>
 <p>Shin Dong-il wasn’t satisfied when his offer was refused.</p>
 <p>He felt insulted for the first time in a long while.</p>
 <p>The situation wasn’t quite appropriate right now, but he would definitely deal with this issue in the near future.</p>
 <p>While his rage was boiling inside him, the door swung open and the maid entered again.</p>
 <p>“Mi, Milord! You must esca…”</p>
 <p>The maid couldn’t finish her sentence.</p>
 <p><em>Slash!</em></p>
 <p>Her shadow took the form of a scythe and reaped its owner’s head.</p>
 <p><em>Thud.</em></p>
 <p>Shin Dong-il and Count Oswald’s eyes went wide when the two separate parts of the body fell to the floor.</p>
 <p>“Wha, what is happening?!”</p>
 <p>“Is there anyone outside?! Come and protect me immediately!”</p>
 <p>The two men began to loudly call for their subordinates, but it was already too late.</p>
 <p>They had all been murdered by the shadow killer.</p>
 <p>‘She’s coming at us straightforwardly.’</p>
 <p>There was no reason for Woohyuk to act ignorant anymore.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk quickly erased the stigma on Count Oswald’s chest and pulled out Grandia.</p>
 <p>‘I can’t block illusions. Not even when using Asura’s demonic energy.’</p>
 <p>But if he did not use all his skills, he would find it hard to resist the effects of debuffs.</p>
 <p>It was a fatal penalty for Woohyuk as he couldn’t reveal his identity nor his abilities.</p>
 <p>As he began to prepare himself mentally,</p>
 <p>“Huhuhu… Everyone looks quite nervous.”</p>
 <p>A mature woman’s voice resonated around them.</p>
 <p>“Who, who are you?!”</p>
 <p>“Stop hiding and reveal yourself!”</p>
 <p>The surprised Shin Dong-il and Count Oswald shouted out loud.</p>
 <p>But the woman ignored the two of them and continued speaking.</p>
 <p>“I was very surprised when I first saw you here. I was certain I had heard you were in Dornen.”</p>
 <p>“So you were aware of me from the very beginning.”</p>
 <p>“Of course I was. You did quite the unfathomable thing at the sanctuary.”</p>
 <p>The sanctuary the woman was talking about was the forest Kriemhild was residing in.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk nodded and raised Grandia towards the direction where the voice was originating from.</p>
 <p>“Then I’ll keep this short. I have some things to ask you, so I suggest you surrender.”</p>
 <p>“Huhuh… How disappointing. I thought you’d bring up an exciting story.”</p>
 <p>As the woman finished her sentence, a loud shatter resounded as the barrier broke into pieces.</p>
 <p>A purple mist was immediately generated and filled the entire office.</p>
 <p>“Don’t do anything unnecessary, Amy.”</p>
 <p>“Oh my, you even know my name… That’s a bit problematic. We’re not even at a ball.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk felt a cold aura from behind.</p>
 <p>He twisted his body and avoided a shadow scythe that cut his afterimage in half.</p>
 <p>“Too slow.”</p>
 <p>“You shouldn’t comment on a woman’s dancing skills. It’s bad manners.”</p>
 <p>After a short war of words, a breathtaking physical exchange took place.</p>
 <p>As the winner couldn’t easily get determined, Shin Dong-il pointed his arrow at Woohyuk’s fluttering shadow.</p>
 <p>‘Now’s my chance.’</p>
 <p>Although he wasn’t aware of what his opponent was, he had realized that the shadow could be physically injured according to the battle between shadow and owner.</p>
 <p>Soon, Shin Dong-il released his bowstring.</p>
 <p><em>Woooosh!</em></p>
 <p>Three arrows covered in electricity flew across the room with a sharp sound.</p>
 <p>[Multishot]</p>
 <p>One of the innate skills of the ranger class.</p>
 <p>“Only misbehaving children intervene in a dance.”</p>
 <p>Amy swiftly dodged the arrows as she spoke naughtily.</p>
 <p>Then, Shin Dong-il’s shadow crept up and changed into a scythe. It then swung to reap its owner’s soul.</p>
 <p><em>Slash!</em></p>
 <p>“Keuk…”</p>
 <p>Shin Dong-il spat out blood as his upper and lower bodies fell separately.</p>
 <p>Count Oswald’s face went blue next to the latest victim.</p>
 <p>“This, this can’t be…”</p>
 <p>“Huhuh… Don’t worry. Your turn hasn’t come yet. Ah, only if you don’t run away crying like a child.”</p>
 <p>Amy spoke sarcastically as she chuckled.</p>
 <p>Count Oswald fell down on the spot, unbelievably shocked. Woohyuk then released his demonic energy as if he had been waiting for this chance.</p>
 <p>‘I can now use my abilities to their full extent.’</p>
 <p>There had been too many eyes on him. He couldn’t show his skills as he had to keep his identity hidden.</p>
 <p>Even if he used his Lost Lyre, it would be hard to cover up the battle that would happen right now.</p>
 <p>‘Let’s end this now.’</p>
 <p>There was no need for him to let the fight drag on.</p>
 <p>Amy’s plan would also involve taking Choi Kayoon, who was currently hiding, as a hostage.</p>
 <p><em>Swoosh!</em></p>
 <p>Verserios roared as it appeared and Amy let out her surprise.</p>
 <p>“Wow, is that the weapon that devoured the Witch of Envy? My heart is trembling just by the sight of it.”</p>
 <p>“Your mischieves come to an end now, Amy.”</p>
 <p>Once he began releasing his demonic energy, his enemy’s figure began to appear within the mist.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk immediately reduced the distance between them and swung Verserios.</p>
 <p><em>Slash!</em></p>
 <p>With a dull cut, Amy’s head dropped to the floor.</p>
 <p>‘There we go… No, she’s not dead yet.’</p>
 <p>It was another one of her tricks. The victim to his sword just now was only a puppet.</p>
 <p>As Woohyuk stood emotionlessly, the beheaded head began to laugh.</p>
 <p>“Huhu… You noticed very quickly. That’s right. This is just a puppet with my appearance. I can’t do anything with it once its strings are severed.”</p>
 <p>“Looks like you were too scared to come to this mansion and face me.”</p>
 <p>“Honestly speaking… You’re correct. I don’t want to get devoured by a monster like you. But I still wanted to verify the extent of your abilities.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk was the target of the Witch Cult’s attention due to the fact that he had defeated the Witch of Envy.</p>
 <p>However, so were his previous companions.</p>
 <p>He didn’t need to worry about Sieg as he was powerful. But Tinia and Silvia were in danger.</p>
 <p>“Were you planning on taking over the Izuna Kingdom by killing the nobles involved in the central politics?”</p>
 <p>“I can’t answer that. We also have things called secrets.”</p>
 <p>“Are you talking about the monsters? I can vaguely guess what your strategy is from the fact that the monsters are migrating towards this city. You must’ve made a deal with the Golden Rose Society.”</p>
 <p>“Huhu… Who knows? In any case, I wish you luck. I will always be observing you from behind.”</p>
 <p>As Amy stopped talking, the beheaded puppet turned to dust and faded away.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk sighed and activated his Call to Arms skill to summon Choi Kayoon.</p>
 <p>“Is, is it over?”</p>
 <p>“The worst of it at least.”</p>
 <p>Choi Kayoon had heeded to Woohyuk’s advice and had joined the Ragnarok Clan.</p>
 <p>Not to work with the other members, but so that he could call for her during emergencies.</p>
 <p>Despite her aversion of men, some compromise was inevitable during certain situations.</p>
 <p>“What do we do if the shadow killer appears again?”</p>
 <p>“That won’t happen for a while.”</p>
 <p>Amy was a cautious opponent. She wouldn’t do something that could potentially bite back at her.</p>
 <p>However, that wouldn’t stop her from trying to take over the Izuna Kingdom.</p>
 <p>After Woohyuk reassured her, Choi Kayoon noticed Shin Dong-il crawling on the floor.</p>
 <p>“Huh…?! This guy…”</p>
 <p>“Do you know him?”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk pretended not to know the past between Choi Kayoon and Shin Dong-il.</p>
 <p>He couldn’t reveal the fact that he had used the Memory Pendant to read her memories.</p>
 <p>“He’s my archenemy. The person who completely ruined my life.”</p>
 <p>Choi Kayoon trembled as she was reminded of unpleasant memories.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk observed her before turning away as if he didn’t care.</p>
 <p>“I won’t stop you if you want revenge. I didn’t like him much either.”</p>
 <p>When he had shot his arrows earlier, he might’ve accidentally hit Woohyuk as well.</p>
 <p>Shin Dong-il was well aware of that fact, but that hadn’t stopped him from shooting.</p>
 <p>Choi Kayoon nodded at Woohyuk’s words and took out a dagger. She approached the crawling man and stabbed him in the back.</p>
 <p><em>Stab!</em></p>
 <p><em>Stab!</em></p>
 <p>“Keuk…”</p>
 <p>“You fucking asshole. Do you know how much I waited for this moment to come? I withstood and survived all kinds of incidents just for this moment. The moment when I can finally kill you with my own hands!”</p>
 <p>Shin Dong-il didn’t die easily. Woohyuk was secretly using his demonic energy to hold onto the man’s consciousness, so that Choi Kayoon could listen to Shin Dong-il’s cries until she was satisfied.</p>
 <p>Soon enough, the bloodied Shin Dong-il drew his last breath.</p>
 <p>“Haa… Haa…”</p>
 <p>Choi Kayoon dropped her dagger and sat down, devoid of all energy.</p>
 <p>Her face was expressionless despite the fact that she had successfully gotten her revenge.</p>
 <p>“Are you satisfied now?”</p>
 <p>“...Thank you for listening to my request.”</p>
 <p>She didn’t bother asking him to understand, as she knew that she must’ve looked like a crazy woman to others.</p>
 <p>However, she didn’t regret anything as it was her lifelong wish. Revenge.</p>
 <p>For some reason, she felt like she had become a monster.</p>
 <p>As Choi Kayoon erased all of her complicated thoughts, Woohyuk lent her a hand.</p>
 <p>“Let’s begin cleaning up. We’ll get arrested as the criminals if we stay like this.”</p>
 <p>“...Alright.”</p>
 <p>Choi Kayoon gently grabbed Woohyuk’s hand and stood up.</p>
 <p>Her heart had opened up to him, albeit modestly.</p>
 <p>“Just, just what kinds of humans are you…?”</p>
 <p>The breathless Count Oswald spoke as he watched the two of them.</p>
 <p>Instead of answering, Woohyuk took out a Lost Lyre from his pocket.</p>
 <p>Before long, a dissonant sound resonated in the office.</p>
