 <p>“Wake up.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk shook the unconscious princess awake.</p>
 <p>However, she did not easily open her eyes, as if she were affected by a debuff.</p>
 <p>‘This is troublesome.’</p>
 <p>Her pulse and breathing were fine, but it would be hard to carry her outside.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk took out a potion to remove all abnormal status conditions and made the princess drink it.</p>
 <p>“Mmm…”</p>
 <p>Soon enough, Princess Lizbeth groaned slightly and slowly opened her eyes.</p>
 <p>“How do you feel?”</p>
 <p>“Wh-who are you?”</p>
 <p>“I was requested by King Henry to rescue you, Princess.”</p>
 <p>“By father…?”</p>
 <p>Princess Lizbeth’s eyes widened as if she couldn’t believe his words.</p>
 <p>“We mustn’t stay here. We have to escape as fast as possible.”</p>
 <p>“That, that woman won’t stay still.”</p>
 <p>Amy Klein.</p>
 <p>She was the woman who had kidnapped her as well as the mastermind behind this entire incident.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk nodded as he listened to the princess’ explanation.</p>
 <p>“I am aware. She won’t be an easy opponent.”</p>
 <p>“How did you bypass the Witch Cult and reach here?”</p>
 <p>“I will tell you once we return to the Izuna Kingdom safe and sound.”</p>
 <p>There was no need for him to narrate his terrible orc portrayal in this underground cell.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk verified that there was no witch stigma on her before speaking again.</p>
 <p>“You will have to wear a disguise before we leave. Would that be alright with you, Princess?”</p>
 <p>“Yes? Yes…”</p>
 <p>Princess Lizbeth nodded with a confused face. She had no idea how she was supposed to disguise herself.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk handed the items he was wearing to her one by one.</p>
 <p>[Banshee’s Cloak].</p>
 <p>[Moonshadow Ring].</p>
 <p>[Queen Star Snake Ghost].</p>
 <p>[Elder Naga’s Ancient Ring].</p>
 <p>[Jester’s Mask].</p>
 <p>They were vital to her protection and her concealment.</p>
 <p>“Did you understand how to use them all?”</p>
 <p>“Yes… These are all incredible items.”</p>
 <p>Princess Lizbeth expressed her astonishment.</p>
 <p>She now understood how Woohyuk had reached her location without getting caught.</p>
 <p>“You have to act as I say from now on.”</p>
 <p>She first had to use the Jester’s Mask to pose as a believer of the Witch Cult, and use the Moonshadow Ring to modify her status window.</p>
 <p>Finally, she had to wear the Banshee’s Cloak to make herself invisible.</p>
 <p>“Will this plan really work?”</p>
 <p>“This is indispensable if we wish to increase your chances of survival as much as possible.”</p>
 <p>They wouldn’t get detected by Amy until they left the 3rd underground floor, as Woohyuk was using Agnes’ Dark Crystal to avoid the witch stigmas, while Princess Lizbeth was invisible.</p>
 <p>“You need to blend in with the Witch Cult as naturally as possible once we reach the floor above us. Don’t worry, I can recognize you whenever and wherever you are.”</p>
 <p>He had received the Messenger's Wings as a reward back on Twilight Tower’s 96th floor.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk could use it to share his vision for upto 3 days with an individual he had touched physically. However, the number of times it could be used was limited to 3 times.</p>
 <p>He had already used it once before, and had 2 usages left.</p>
 <p>“You’re really thorough.”</p>
 <p>“That’s how I’ve managed to survive until today.”</p>
 <p>It was difficult to survive on the Eeth Continent if he couldn’t keep his cool during moments of danger.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk told Princess Lizbeth of certain things to be cautious of, and they both exited the stone cell.</p>
 <p><em>Step. Step.</em></p>
 <p>Their footsteps echoed in the hollow corridor.</p>
 <p>[Choi Kayoon, how are things on your side?]</p>
 <p>[We’ve made it into the inner area of the wasteland. Where are you?]</p>
 <p>[Underground. Tell Ronald not to enter but to guard the entrance.]</p>
 <p>They had to destroy the Izuna Kingdom’s Witch Cult from its roots now that things had come to this.</p>
 <p>After finishing his conversation with Choi Kayoon, Woohyuk and Princess Lizbeth arrived at the bottom of the spiral staircase.</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p>The air weighed heavily on their shoulders.</p>
 <p>If their plan derailed even by a slight amount, things would become chaotic.</p>
 <p>Fortunately, nothing happened to them until they reached the 2nd floor.</p>
 <p>‘Seems like they haven’t finished the summoning ritual yet.’</p>
 <p>Behemoth was a legendary demonic beast. It wasn’t a surprise the ritual would take a long time.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk separated from Princess Lizbeth and ran instantly to the open area where the summoning was taking place.</p>
 <p>“We meet again, Amy.”</p>
 <p>“You’re… Oh! You’re Chun Woohyuk, aren’t you? Or should I call you Asura? I didn’t recognize you for a moment since you changed your appearance.”</p>
 <p>She appeared to have done a background investigation about him since their last encounter.</p>
 <p>Amy made a relaxed smile while Woohyuk brandished Verserios.</p>
 <p>“Trying to summon Behemoth here… You’re completely insane. Are you going to offer the believers as sacrifices?”</p>
 <p>“The believers? Don’t worry. They don’t fear useless things such as death.”</p>
 <p>The believers of the Witch Cult were prepared to offer their lives at any time for the return of Lilith.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk frowned as Amy spoke proudly.</p>
 <p>“I’ll have to defeat you here... Unless you’re another puppet right now.”</p>
 <p>“Huhu… There’s no way I’d conduct such an important ritual through a wooden doll. But if you’re really curious, you can try cutting me down like last time.”</p>
 <p>Amy swung the blood-drenched scythe and provoked her enemy.</p>
 <p>Soon enough, her appearance began to fade away, and Woohyuk released the demonic energy in him.</p>
 <p>‘She’s a lot more agile and nimble compared to last time.’</p>
 <p>It was no surprise that the actual body was stronger and faster than a puppet controlled at a distance.</p>
 <p>However, she was but a mere human.</p>
 <p>She was no match to Woohyuk who had defeated Demon King Volak and the Witch of Envy Kriemhild.</p>
 <p>‘Unless her powers have reached the same heights as Aleister Crowley’s.’</p>
 <p>Woohyuk avoided the scythe cutting through the air from behind him and grabbed Amy’s wrist.</p>
 <p>Immediately, a bone-cracking sound echoed as Amy’s arm twisted in an odd direction.</p>
 <p>“Argh!”</p>
 <p>“You chose the wrong opponent, Amy.”</p>
 <p>Her miscalculation was to rush her plans after the death of Kriemhild.</p>
 <p>He didn’t know how things had turned out in his past life, but this time, there was no way her plan would succeed as long as he took action.</p>
 <p>No matter what method she used, Amy couldn’t surpass Woohyuk.</p>
 <p><em>Stab!</em></p>
 <p>Verserios penetrated slid inside Amy’s abdomen. Her innards were cut apart and she let out a screeching wail.</p>
 <p>“Kyaaaaaaak!”</p>
 <p>“Let’s settle this now.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk raised his sword to end his opponent’s life.</p>
 <p>At that instant, countless dark arrows flew towards him from every direction.</p>
 <p>The priests of the Witch Cult had intervened in the battle.</p>
 <p>‘Annoying pests.’</p>
 <p>Although they were getting in his way, Woohyuk refrained from slaughtering the believers right now.</p>
 <p>If all these members were to be sacrificed, there was the possibility that the magic sigil on the floor would be completed.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk gathered the demonic energy and protected his body from the attacks.</p>
 <p>“Now, the time has come! You shall all take your own lives to offer a great, nourishing meal to Behemoth! This is all for Lady Lilith’s return!”</p>
 <p>Amy shouted in a piercing voice as she held onto her bleeding stomach.</p>
 <p>At those words, the believers obediently took out the daggers hidden in their robes and slit their own necks.</p>
 <p><em>Slash!</em></p>
 <p>A dark red liquid began bursting and pouring out of the severed carotids.</p>
 <p>The small puddles of blood surrounding the sigil gathered to form a single sea of blood.</p>
 <p><em>Rumble</em><em>!</em></p>
 <p>Pitch black sparks of electricity bursted out of the magic sigil on the floor and a dark vortex formed as it swirled.</p>
 <p>‘So things have come to this.’</p>
 <p>He had somehow expected this situation.</p>
 <p>He had experienced a similar situation back in the witch’s forest, and he was also aware of the Witch Cult’s believers’ mentality.</p>
 <p>However, he had hoped that this series of events would’ve happened after he had successfully ended Amy’s heartbeat.</p>
 <p>Princess Lizbeth’s hidden location would be revealed with the death of the believers, and Amy could take advantage of the defenseless woman.</p>
 <p>“Why aren’t you killing yourself?! Cut your throat with your dagger already!”</p>
 <p>“...”</p>
 <p>The disguised princess flinched at Amy’s outburst and stepped backwards.</p>
 <p>Amy’s expressions relaxed immediately as she saw the scene.</p>
 <p>“Oh, I see. So you’ve already rescued Princess Lizbeth. Impressive, Chun Woohyuk. I never expected you to hinder my plans this much.”</p>
 <p>“...Silence.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk was currently concentrating on the magic sigil.</p>
 <p>He had to destroy the sigil before the summoning was complete, just as he had done within Martinus’ imaginary world.</p>
 <p>As Woohyuk raised Verserios to prepare his attack, Amy mocked him.</p>
 <p>“Huhu… The sigil is already complete. Behemoth will soon be summoned! You should escape instead of attacking meaninglessly, if you wish to save the princess.”</p>
 <p>Their surroundings were a mess.</p>
 <p>The floor was bloodied and corpses were scattered everywhere, and a black vortex spun around the magic sigil.</p>
 <p>However, Woohyuk stood steadily in the middle of this chaotic hall.</p>
 <p>“We would’ve escaped already if that could resolve our current problem.”</p>
 <p>And if he wasn’t someone who would patiently wait and pray for help. If he were, he never would’ve regressed 40 in time.</p>
 <p>He had realized it back in his previous life.</p>
 <p>This world had no paradise.</p>
 <p>“...That is why I must reach it.”</p>
 <p>The Demon God’s Throne.</p>
 <p>If he kept challenging and completing impossible feats, he could one day reach the Demon God’s Throne.</p>
 <p>It was with this belief that he survived and would continue marching forward.</p>
 <p>The importance was to remain calm and steady no matter the situation.</p>
 <p>And once this belief turned to resolve and fighting spirit, despair would finally turn into hope.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk’s face was confident as he watched the Behemoth reveal it’s head from the pitch black magic sigil.</p>
 <p>‘This is but a simple step towards achieving my goal.’</p>
 <p>It was unknown if his accomplishment in Martinus’ spiritual world was also achievable in reality.</p>
 <p>However, this was another challenge he had to take on.</p>
 <p>Avoiding this confrontation would result in nothing but destruction and deaeths.</p>
 <p><em>Crack!</em></p>
 <p>Woohyuk stabbed Verserios into the ground and a large fissure grew on the sigil.</p>
 <p>Things had developed differently compared to the battle in the imaginary world.</p>
 <p>But Woohyuk didn’t falter and concentrated all his demonic energy at the tip of his sword.</p>
 <p><em>Boooom!</em></p>
 <p>The energy gathered at the tip exploded and shattered the magic sigil, as a black smoke expanded with the shockwave.</p>
 <p>Amy coughed and stared at Woohyuk with a furious face.</p>
 <p>“Im, impossible… I’m certain that Behemoth had answered my call…”</p>
 <p>“Isn’t it a bit too big to call it a pet?”</p>
 <p>Asura’s successor spoke as he stepped out of the black cloud.</p>
 <p>He pointed at Amy’s throat with Verserios.</p>
 <p>“You had great ambitions, but they were all in vain.”</p>
 <p>“Huhu… Do you really think so?”</p>
 <p>“You couldn’t change anything. Not the believers, nor the kingdom, nor your own fate.”</p>
 <p>During their battle, Woohyuk had activated the Memory Pendant when he had grabbed and twisted Amy’s arm.</p>
 <p>She had been abandoned when her parents had divorced and remarried due to familial discord.</p>
 <p>Amy cursed at the gods and at her own fate, and vowed to turn the tables of the world and change everything.</p>
 <p>Later on, it was quite obvious that she was raised by the Witch Cult into a cold-hearted assassin.</p>
 <p>“Yes, you’re right. It’s my loss, so kill me already using that fascinating sword of yours.”</p>
 <p>“...I shall grant your wish.”</p>
 <p>Woohyuk raised Verserios to put an end to this conflict.</p>
 <p>Amy smirked at his movements and suddenly took a dagger out of her chest.</p>
 <p>“Watch out!”</p>
 <p>Princess Lizbeth cried out as she ran towards the two.</p>
 <p>However, Woohyuk didn’t react and stared down on Amy. He had already predicted her actions.</p>
 <p><em>Slit!</em></p>
 <p>The sharp dagger cut the woman’s thin neck.</p>
 <p>The princess was shocked by the sight of Amy dropping on the floor, as if the strings controlling her had been cut.</p>
 <p>“She, she killed herself…?”</p>
 <p>“She must’ve wanted to choose her own destiny.</p>
 <p>She was like a firecracker that bloomed magnificently and immediately faded into nothingness.</p>
 <p>Woohyuk clicked his tongue as he watched the wide-eyed Amy on the floor.</p>
