 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t understand you… Why bother?” A man came out of the crowd. It was Yun Yiyuan. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"And I don’t understand why </span><i><span style>you</span></i><span style>’ve never questioned whether this is right!” Li Yiming said angrily. He knew fully well the reason why he was surrounded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"I’ve had my doubts, but in the end, it’s just the reality of things” Yun Yiyuan replied calmly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve killed enough.” Li Yiming clenched his fists. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They need to die…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Over my dead body.” Li Yiming had no intention to yield. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? What about you? Do you hold the same kind of conviction?” Yu Yiyuan looked at those who stood behind Li Yiming, pausing briefly on Stargaze. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Aside from Liu Meng, who remained inflexible, the rest of Li Yiming’s friends seemed to hesitate. Having sworn to serve Heaven’s Laws when they climbed the Stage of Ascension, they thought that they knew where their loyalty lied. However, they were now faced with a test of faith. Torn between Li Yiming and their long-held beliefs, they had to make a decision. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, let me just say something.” The apparent wavering of Li Yiming’s friends caught Stargaze’s attention. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wang Liping, what are you trying to say?” Yun Yiyuan asked in a cold voice. He had already tired himself with fighting Li Huaibei, and going up against another sage was the last thing he wanted. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry, the only one on our side who can still put up a fight is Li Yiming. As for you… Yun Yiyuan, the strongest man in the world, you would not deign winning through numbers now, would you?” Stargaze said calmly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you saying that…” Yun Yiyuan scrutinized Li Yiming for the first time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. What better way to prove your righteousness than through your own hands.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘She’s asking me to duel him…’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming was aware that his friends would be left unattended against the other guardians if he were to fight Yun Yiyuan. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. I promise you that they’ll be safe.” Stargaze saw through Li Yiming’s doubt and looked around, making her will clearly known. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright!” Li Yiming turned toward Yun Yiyuan, his heart burning with a desire for combat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Yiyuan frowned and glanced at Stargaze again. His pride did not allow him to refuse the duel proposed by Stargaze. </span><i><span style>‘But… why is she confident? This young man is level six at best… It’s suicide to try to fight me…’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“You have potential, kid. Are you sure you want to do this?” Yun Yiyuan said with severity as he examined Li Yiming from head to toe. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming did not answer Yun Yiyuan, but the way he postured himself made it clear that a fight was inevitable. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If words are not enough to convince you, then perhaps my spear will.” Yun Yiyuan was a little irritated by the fact that Li Yiming had completely disregarded his “well-intended” counsel. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Careful… Li Huaibei lost…” Liu Meng said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming nodded and walked forward. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A ripple came out of Yun Yiyuan’s hands. Just as he extended his arms, both he and Li Yiming vanished. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come at me. I don’t want to take advantage of your youth.” Although the spectators had vanished, Yun Yiyuan was still as prideful as ever.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming lowered his arms as sparks wrapped around his limbs. His pupils slowly turned purple. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Are you crazy?’ </span></i><span style>Bai Ze exclaimed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming had decided to consume the power of his Thunder Purity. This was akin to a suicidal attack, but Li Yiming had no choice; Yun Yiyuan had defeated Li Huaibei, and Li Yiming was aware of the extent of Li Huaibei’s power to understand that he would never come close to being able to defeat Li Huaibei, even less someone who was stronger. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Against overwhelming odds, Li Yiming’s only chance at winning was Thunderous Strike.</span> <span style>However, unsure about the effectiveness of the attack at its current level, he consumed his Thunder Purity to enhance his attack power. After witnessing the power unleashed by Liu Meng when she consumed her phoenix essence, he held onto the slim chance that he would be able to defeat Yun Yiyuan with one strike. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Yiyuan prepared himself for Li Yiming’s oncoming attack. He clasped his hands around his spear and lowered the tip, ready to strike. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thunderous Strike!” Li Yiming could feel the jolts of electricity raging violently within his own body. He glared at Yun Yiyuan and pushed forward with both of his hands. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A ray of purple light suddenly traversed the sky. Yun Yiyuan looked up in stupor, only to see a fissure open up in the sky, and a giant eye staring at him from across the chasm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>”Heaven’s Punishment? You’re a </span><i><span style>sage</span></i><span style>?” Yun Yiyuan screamed.</span> <span style>He would never have thought that such a young man could be a sage, much less an attack of such destructive force as the opening act. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Yiyuan retreated swiftly, but he realized that the giant eye was following him no matter how fast he went. A bolt of black thunder came from the fissure and reached him in an instant. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“No!” Yun Yiyuan’s weapon irradiated with white light, and his power climbing to its apex as he prepared to fight for his life.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yun Yiyuan roared in anger as the miniature sun he created with his spear collided against the purple thunder which descended from the sky. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A flash of light suddenly gleamed the entire area of the battle, blinding Li Yiming. </span></p>
 <p><span style>And then nothing. No sound, no light, only dead silence. Blood colored Li Yiming’s lips as he fell down to his knees. The hill that was in front of him had been obliterated, leaving a massive hole in the ground. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s dead?” Li Yiming could not feel Yun Yiyuan’s presence anymore. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘He’s gone… He sacrificed his own weapon…’ </span></i><span style>Bai Ze said with a weak voice. Li Yiming’s attack had also depleted all of her power. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The Boundary created by Yun Yiyuan soon collapsed, and Li Yiming returned to where he was a few minutes ago. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This fast? Where is…” Stargaze was dumbfounded when she saw Li Yiming, and even more so when she did not see Yun Yiyuan. </span><i><span style>‘Did he…’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming fell to one knee and wiped away the blood on the corner of his mouth. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Yiming!” Liu Meng rushed toward to help him stand up again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Does anyone else want to try me?” Li Yiming’s gaze swept across the crowd of guardians, sending a shiver down the spines of those who dared to make eye contact. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What happened to Yun Yiyuan?” A ruckus occurred in the crowd of guardians as the implications of Li Yiming emerging from his duel first became obvious. Some of the guardians were already remembering the nightmarish scenes of Li Yiming tasting the blood of his enemies back at the Eastern Gate. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Run!’ Someone in the crowd yelled, and the guardians scattered, each running for dear life. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You cannot run…” A quiet voice came. The guardians who were fleeing at full speed just a second ago were nailed in place. A skinny, short man walked out of the shadows and appeared in front of Li Yiming. He wore plain clothes and a pair of flip-flops. His right hand was held open right next to his ear, and with his other hand he held a small, knit bag. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Kong… Kong…” Stargaze trembled in terror as she recognized the stranger. However, to finish his full name seemed like an impossible task. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh…” Mr. Kong sighed and clenched his right fist. </span></p>
 <p><span style>A shower of blood fell as the guardians who were frozen in place were crushed into balls of flesh and bones before completely vanishing from sight. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Kong…” Li Yiming was surprised at Mr. Kong’s pitiless slaughter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They cannot stay... “ Mr. kong suddenly turned his head toward the people behind Li Yiming. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No…” Before Li Yiming could react, Mr. kong raised his head, and all of Li Yiming’s friends fell to the ground. The survivors from Lianyun City, which Li Yiming had so painstakingly saved, all disappeared, leaving only Lin Lu, Chen Quan, Shen Jianming, and You Fang behind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They…” Li Yiming held Liu Meng in his arms, and her steadily beating heart calmed him down somewhat. He was not quite sure of what to say. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They also need to go…” Mr. Kong sat down on a rock in front of Li Yiming. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve surprised me. I don’t understand you anymore…” Mr. Kong took out a pack of cigarettes and lit up one for himself without offering any to Li Yiming. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming stared at the mysterious man who seemed to possess unimaginable powers. He put Liu Meng down with care and approached Mr. Kong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think of Lianyun City?” Mr. Kong took a puff and exhaled smoke from his nostrils. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Is there going to be a disaster if Lianyun City merges with our world?” Li Yiming asked a question instead of answering Mr. Kong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What do you think?” Mr. Kong said in a calm voice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming turned his head toward Shen Jianming, who was still in a coma. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Dao is the one which watches over the sun and the moon as they nurture our world, but it is also pitiless…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes…” Li Yiming looked at the sky above him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>"The </span><i><span style>Dao</span></i><span style> constitutes the rules. Before you’re powerful enough to make your own rules, you should obey them.”</span></p>
