 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Shao Xian dipped herself in the bathtub, her face went flush red. She could not tell if it had to do with the warmth of the water or the fact that Li Yiming and Sai Gao were on the other side of the thin curtain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although Sai Gao’s house was spacious, the interior consisted of only one room, meaning that even the bathroom was exposed. She did not feel as unsettled while sleeping as she was able to cover herself, but taking a bath in such an open space was quite an odd experience.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After spending an entire day outside and exercising after returning home, Shao Xian’s body became unbearably sticky with sweat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Shao Xian’s thoughts wandered, she thought about the moment she came out of her bath — when a woman was at her most attractive state, and wished for Sai Gao to leave some private time between her and Li Yiming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I wonder what they’re doing. I can’t hear anything… Are they out for a smoke on the balcony again?’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shao Xian thought as she played around with water. She knew that Li Yiming was not someone she could hope to be with, but she wished to at least not have any regrets later on in life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming had entered her life only a few weeks ago. She did not know what background he had or what he did for a living, but she did know that he was a person that she would never be able to forget. Her longing for love, which had long gone cold from living alone, was burning once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shao Xian stood up as quietly as possible and tiptoed to the giant mirror beside the bathtub. She examined her slender legs, her spotless skin, and her breasts. For the first time in a long while, Shao Xian could feel her heart race as she thought about what she was going to attempt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shao Xian picked up the bath towel and finished drying herself. After putting on her bathrobe, she tightened the silk belt just enough to reveal her attractive curves.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Thank you, Sai Gao.’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was all thanks to the effort that Sai Gao put to give her her near-perfect appearance. It was only a few days since they have met, but she knew that she could always count on him, and she trusted him wholeheartedly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a final smile in the mirror to pump herself up, Shao Xian slowly pulled on the curtain and walked out. She put one hand on the wall and the other right in front of her body, trying to give the impression that she was hiding herself in shyness from Li Yiming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No one’s here?” Shao Xian looked around, only to find the room empty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Suddenly, she heard a loud noise as two people rolled down the pink sofa.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, she saw a scene that would forever be at the back of her mind: Sai Gao, who had several cuts on his pants to the point that his underwear was seen, sat half-naked on top of Li Yiming. The latter had his shirt ripped into shreds, and visible scratch marks could be seen on his back, which Shao Xian interpreted as signs of passionate lovemaking. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shao Xian closed the curtain right away and retreated to the other side, clasping the collars of her bathrobe tightly.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘They… they… Sai Gao… Even best friends require some personal space…’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I almost died from that…” Sai Gao said in a low, angry voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I told you that I can’t control it.” Li Yiming said between ragged breaths, but he sounded very satisfied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can’t just do whatever you want! You’re enjoying yourself, but I…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“When I’m done, it’ll be your turn. I’ll try my best to satisfy you.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shao Xian slowly turned toward the bathtub as she listened to the ongoing conversation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Please, can I just drown here…’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center">* * *</p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As the day of the music festival arrived, the luxury limousines began to flux into the venue. The vehicles traversed through layers and layers of security, all under constant flashing camera lights.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you okay? You’ll need to give off a good first impression for the rehearsal. Otherwise, they might revoke their invitation for a newcomer like you.” Sai Gao reminded Shao Xian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re right.” Shao Xian was in a low mood. She felt like crying after glancing at Li Yiming, who was driving the car.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Handsome men are already a rarity, and you choose to not make yourselves available…’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She’s nervous, that’s all,” Li Yiming said as he glanced at the rearview mirror. Anybody’s first public performance was bound to be a high hurdle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You have a solid fanbase, but a lot of them are in for the excitement of meeting their idol for the first time in real life. You should be prepared for this opportunity. Hold your head high.” Sai Gao continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll do my best. Thank you.” Shao Xian suddenly realized that she was the third wheel who was trying to put herself between Li Yiming and Sai Gao. She owed everything to them, and, at this point, all she could do was to hope for the happiness for her two dearest friends. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright, we’re here. Let’s go to the backstage,” Sai Gao said as he opened his car door and walked out with their outfits.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming parked the car and went to the back to open the door for Shao Xian, acting out his role of a chauffeur.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘He belongs to someone else…’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shao Xian had to remind herself again as she saw Li Yiming’s handsome smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hello, are you Shao Xian, the one scheduled to perform&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Divine Voice Materialized</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">?” Someone who looked like a staff member came to greet them. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” Sai Gao said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“And you are…” The staff member was surprised at hearing Sai Gao’s high-pitched voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I am her manager.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Manager?” The staff member seemed to have accepted the fact rather quickly, as many were already doubting that there was a mysterious mastermind behind Shao Xian’s overnight success.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can we go in?” Shao Xian said. Sai Gao seemed to enjoy receiving so much attention from the staff member, but Shao Xian tried to prevent the two from getting any closer, as Sai Gao “belonged” to Li Yiming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course. Your room is at the end of the hallway. Nameplates are on the door. Someone will come to get you before the start of the rehearsal,” The staff member said as he concluded that Sai Gao, with his air and attire, did indeed fit the image of a manager almost perfectly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Let’s go.” Shao Xian said.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Don’t get ahead of yourself.” The staff smiled coldly. Having witnessed many overnight celebrities crash down shortly after having had a taste of fame, he firmly believed that Shao Xian was soon about to suffer the same fate.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Shao Xian’s turbulent emotions gradually settled as she walked through the hallway and looked at the nameplate on each door, some of which she had seen on the news before. It was only then that she realized how close she was to achieve her dream. However, the moment she saw her name on the nameplate, she felt as if she had been doused by a bucket of icy cold water. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The room in front of her had a ragged tablecloth hanging from the doorframe, serving as the curtain for the entrance, as it did not even have a door. Moreover, her resting room was facing the hallway leading to the public bathroom. </span></p>
