 <p><span style>After encountering a string of supernatural events, the team became more cautious, slowing down considerably in their trek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>As all technological gadgets have malfunctioned, the scouting team was effectively lost. Despite having no signal, Eyeglasses still marked a nearby tree with a tracker every few miles. The trackers only served as markings at the time, but if telecommunications were to be restored, they would allow him to track their precise position.</span></p>
 <p><span style>You Fang stepped up and took charge when the team was lost. For a man that had not been particularly useful, he managed to consistently determine where North was with a bronze bowl and a single wooden chopstick. Chen Quan nodded with approval when he saw the set-up for the first time and stated that it was an ancient and reliable compass of sorts, lending credibility to the directions that You Fang was suggesting. Similarly, Li Yiming had also checked with his exceptional memory and senses. </span><i><span style>‘His directions are right… At least for now…’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘These traditional methods… It seemed that unimaginable power and methods have been buried in history, privy only to those who hail from ancient schools or sects. The skills that these people possess, Qing Feng, Chen Quan, and now You Fang. I would never have imagined before. Can we truly say that technology and knowledge have evolved or did we simply lose the knowledge that is tied to ancient cultures?’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming thought. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After two occurrences of seeing something that could not be found, the rest of the party believed that Li Yiming must have seen an illusion or was simply paranoid. However, both Eyeglasses and Liu Meng knew better from their trust in Li Yiming and their experiences with the supernatural.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Eyeglasses believed that Li Yiming’s earlier premonition came true: things were no longer as they seemed. He became much more serious, bringing up the rear and constantly surveying his surroundings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming and Liu Meng were at the front, only behind the one leading the charge, Lin Lu. </span><i><span style>‘She truly is a special operations soldier, always being the first one in…’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Are you sure what you saw wasn’t a mirage?’ </span></i><span style>Bai Ze’s voice echoed in Li Yiming's consciousness. The difference between a mirage and an illusion was subtle. The former was a natural phenomenon and the latter, a spell of some sort. Li Yiming understood the nuance.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘I’m sure. I definitely saw actual people.’</span></i><span style> Li Yiming said as he recalled the three figures.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘If you’re sure that it wasn’t a mirage and even I didn’t see it… There are only some things in the world that only you can see…’ </span></i><span style>Bai Ze trusted Li Yiming as much as she trusted herself.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I think I know what it was.” Li Yiming nodded. </span><i><span style>‘It’s people like me… Bugs in the system…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Suddenly, Li Yiming paused and scanned his surroundings with piercing eyes.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Again?’ </span></i><span style>Bai Ze sensed the surroundings but to no avail.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Upon hearing the pause in the footsteps, Lin Lu, who had been walking ahead, did not even bother turning around but crouched down on one knee and raised her gun, sweeping the area in front of her. The rest of the team all entered combat&nbsp;position as her two subordinates rolled into cover. Eyeglasses disappeared seemingly into thin air and Chen Quan pulled Mr. You down into some nearby bushes for cover.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Yiming?” After another round of checking and finding nothing out of the ordinary, Lin Lu was beginning to get fed up with Li Yiming. </span><i><span style>‘I can respect your self-confidence and choice of choosing not to take the antidote.. But to be as paranoid and jumpy as you are now, you’re affecting the entire team.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>But before Lin Lu could voice her displeasure, Li Yiming drew his firearm, took aim, and fired.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Three shots rang out and Li Yiming slowly lowered his gun with a grave countenance.</span><i><span style>‘It’s appeared again…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>This time, trees had appeared instead of men. Trees that looked similar to the ones that surrounded them. Despite their thick trunks being rooted to the ground, they shifted positions swiftly within the forest, moving without leaving any trace behind.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming fired at the trees without a second thought. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The tension that had mostly dissipated returned in full with the jarring gunshots. But, after a long period of time, nothing happened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you see this time, Li Yiming?” Lin Lu lowered her gun and stood up slowly, glancing at Li Yiming with piercing and judgemental eyes. She could not take it anymore.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming did not answer and looked pointedly at Eyeglasses, who had appeared from the bushes. He knew from Eyeglasses’ expression that he was the only person who had seen anything, once again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I have no doubt in your abilities, but the fact of the matter is that we’re a team. We are dealing with an unprecedented supernatural event and surrounded by unpredictable danger. Please follow my orders and take the antidote. As you are now, you’ll bring this team down. Furthermore… Suppose there were unknown enemies around us. You have just exposed our position with your gunshots.” Despite her stern countenance, Lin Lu’s tone was amicable. She truly possessed the ability to command effectively in unexpected situations and knew that during tense situations, she should not be too confrontational, especially towards a team member whom she had already acknowledged.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Ignoring Lin Lu’s accusations and suggestions, Li Yiming bent down and picked up the casings of the three bullets that he had fired. “These are the casings.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Lu was visibly confused.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The shells are here, but where are the bullets?” Li Yiming placed the three shells in Lin Lu’s hand and walked to the back of the team while holding Liu Meng’s hand. He knew that Lin Lu had to go and find the bullets.</span><i><span style> ‘I’m sure that I hit the moving tree. I even saw the splinters that flew off the bark, but the tree disappeared…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>As she fiddled with the shells in her hand, Lin Lu looked at her two subordinates. After a brief period of hesitation, she called out before dashing into the forest, “Chen Quan, Zhang Shanjun, come with me. The rest, stay here and remain on guard.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>At the back of the team, Eyeglasses whispered to Li Yiming. “You saw something again?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah. But this time it wasn’t a person, but a tree.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A tree?’ Confusion was visible in Eyeglasses’ eyes as he wondered to himself. </span><i><span style>‘We’re in a forest. What else should we be seeing, if not trees?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“It was a moving tree, and I hit it just now,”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“What’s going on? This was supposed to be a vacation trip. What happened to that?” Eyeglasses scratched his nose in frustration. But even then, he was more curious than worried.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t let your guard down. Forests with no animals… Reversals of day and night… Mysterious men who appear and disappear, and now moving trees…” Li Yiming hesitated briefly before continuing, “ I think we might have entered a secret domain.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Impossible.” Before Li Yiming could even finish, Eyeglasses refuted him and continued, “ One needs a key to enter a domain. Even if there was one here right now, we still wouldn’t be able to.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>‘</span><i><span style>That’s right…’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming suddenly remembered that with his special circumstances, he had no knowledge of keys to secret domains.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Are keys essential to entering a secret domain?” Li Yiming asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, that’s the rules…” Eyeglasses was baffled by such a borderline idiotic question coming from someone as experienced as Li Yiming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Indeed, we were reminded numerous times on the Stage of Ascension that should we reject to participate in a secret domain, we would not receive the key. That immunite doesn’t depend on the physical location.” Liu Meng elaborated meekly, believing that Li Yiming was simply a little too nervous. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Not a secret domain... Then what could it be…’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming remained deep in thought.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>'Yiming. There’s a way for normal guardians to be swept into a secret domain, even without the key. But… If this is really the case, the situation has truly gone out of hand…' </span></i><span style>Bai Ze’s voice rang out in his consciousness in a grave tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh. What is it?” Li Yiming was somewhat happy at the confirmation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Yiming! What exactly did you see just now?” Lin Lu’s anxious voice rang out from afar as she approached hastily, dashing out of the woods. She almost barreled over Liu Meng, who was standing right by Li Yiming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After a grid by grid search of the surrounding area, the results were as Li Yiming predicted - no bullets were found. This startled Lin Lu greatly as she had witnessed him firing those bullets. Judging by how he held the gun and the firepower of his firearm, those bullets should not have flown past a hundred meters. With her experience, she should have been able to easily locate them. And yet…</span></p>
 <p><span style>To miss a single bullet in such a thick forest was understandable, but for all three to go missing meant that there was definitely something else at work.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw a moving tree. I hit it just now.” Li Yiming hesitated and decided to reveal the truth. </span><i><span style>‘Regardless of the situation and how it may change in the near future, these guys have already caught up in it. They have a right to know. After all, we are a team now.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“A moving tree?” Lin Lu looked at Chen Quan with incredulous eyes, seeking his opinion.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Chen Quan furrowed his brows and remained silent. He dealt with the dead, fable and legends on a daily basis. After all, the more legendary a tomb was, the higher the selling price of items stolen from there. However, across his years of tomb raiding, he had not come across nearly as many abnormalities as he had on this trek.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, a moving tree. It was a cedar tree.”Li Yiming nodded and swept his gaze across the team. He had to gauge the response of the team, because if Bai Ze’s tone was of any indication, trouble was lurking ahead.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Just as he was sweeping the team, Li Yiming noticed, to his surprise, that they were down a man. “Wait! Where’s You Fang?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You Fang?” Lin Lu turned around and looked in between the three climbing machines. </span><i><span style>‘He was sitting right there when I left…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“He was still here just now.” Shen Jianming shouted in surprise; he had purposely stood near You Fang to protect this seemingly defenseless old man. When Lin Lu had rushed out of the bushes to question Li Yiming, he had been distracted for only a brief moment. &nbsp;</span><i><span style>‘Where is he?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“He couldn’t have gone far. Pair up and search the area. Do not go alone!” Lin Lu barked out her orders before diving back into the bushes.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming’s eyes met with Eyeglasses’ before rushing toward another direction with Liu Meng.&nbsp;</span><span style>However, he wanted more to know about what Bai Ze had to say. </span><i><span style>‘Did you not see anything?’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘No…’</span></i></p>
