 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Inside a hotel suite, the survivors from the Shangbei domain gathered around a table. All seemed happy and were still in disbelief at their good luck. Qing Qiaoqiao was the only person who was not so relieved. She did not believe Li Yiming’s explanation about Liu Meng’s absence and instead judged it to be a pretense aimed at lessening the psychological burdens of those that did survive. The more she looked at Li Yiming, </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Eyeglasses!?” Qing Linglong yelled out in horror; the vampiric virus was not something that was cured by at the end of a domain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Look at this!” Eyeglasses played around with a black rock that hung from his neck. It was made of an unknown material, and the craftsmanship was rather crude. This was Eyeglasses’ reward: an adaptive guardian equipment. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Shadowless Pearl?” Li Yiming knew exactly what the object was; the vampiric couple had told him about it. He was happy that Eyeglasses had found just the right item right away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. Ah, it feels good to be under the sun again.” Eyeglasses took a deep breath and sat down next to the window. Being bathed in the warmth of the sun seemed to bring great comfort to Eyeglasses’, at least judging by the expression on his pale visage. However, Li Yiming noticed that the rays of light did not produce a shadow beneath Eyeglasses. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is done is done. We should make plans for the future now.” Qing Linglong was planning ahead, as it was in her habit to do so. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I want to rest.” Big Beard took out a can of beer from the fridge, opened it by biting, and took a long sip. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s not what I mean, and you know it.” Qing Linglong stared directly into his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I know </span><i><span style>what</span></i><span style> you mean. Just give me some time to think.” Big Beard took another sip. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can you find anyone better than Li Yiming?” Qing Linglong pressed on, determined to get an answer from Big Beard. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Li Yiming…’ </span></i><span style>Big Beard squinted as he pondered Qing Linglong’s proposal. He looked at Li Yiming and tried to remember what happened in the domain, but his memories were cut off the moment he fell unconscious. What happened at the end of the Shangbei domain, he did not know, but one thing was for sure; Li Yiming was the last man standing, and Liu Meng was gone. </span><i><span style>‘He said that Liu Meng was gone for convalescence, but is that true? Regardless, the sage level Xiang Liu was slain, there’s no doubt about that from what Heaven’s Laws told me.’ &nbsp;</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree too. We can make better use of our strengths as a team. I have a feeling that we’ll be able to do great things.” Eyeglasses also had his eyes fixated on Li Yiming. “Li Yiming, you don’t belong to a permanent team, do you? </span></p>
 <p><span style>“A permanent team?” Li Yiming snapped out of his reflections. He had been thinking about the seemingly cryptic exchanges between Qing Linglong and Big Beard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“So you don’t have one? Great. Let’s make a team, and you’ll be the captain, okay?” Qing Linglong said with a grin. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How is it any different from what we did before?” Li Yiming asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course. Permanent teams are recognized by Heaven’s Laws. So in the future, whether it’s a domain or anything else, we’ll be treated as a single unit. That’s a big difference from impromptu teams. Most guardians would usually join such a team to maximize mutual self-interest,” Eyeglasses explained. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I used to be part of a team before, but after Qiaoqiao’s awakening, I was told that the team wouldn’t welcome newcomers, so I chose to leave them,” Qing Linglong added and looked at Big Beard. On paper at least, to pool their power together and to work together for a common goal was a plan with no losses and only gains. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m okay with it if you’re all okay with it.” Li Yiming nodded. </span><i><span style>‘It’s way too hard to survive alone in a domain. I can tell first-hand how important it is to have a team to rely on.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What about you?” Qing Linglong looked at Big Beard, who had already finished two beers and was working on his third one. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I accept.” Big Beard put his beer can down. He threw an intense gaze at Li Yiming.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’m not actually insisting on being the team captain. I think that Big Beard could do it, since he was the captain of his own team before.” Li Yiming caught the message. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No, the captain </span><i><span style>has </span></i><span style>to be you. You’re someone who’s worth my trust. I was just hesitating because I missed the people from the old team. We’ve been together for quite many years after all,” Big Beard sighed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“If everything is settled, then we shouldn’t delay any further. For now, the first thing on the agenda is a vacation to relax for a while,” Qing Linglong said with a broad smile. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“How does that… work?” Li Yiming hesitated; he was afraid that it might betray his lack of experience. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s simple. All you need is a team token from the Stage of Ascension. Then, we’ll send the request to join the team. As long as there are more than four members, the team official status is recognized by Heaven’s Laws,” Eyeglasses said. He seemed to be the expert on the appropriate procedures to undertake. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“The Stage of Ascension?” Li Yiming was dumbfounded. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Qing Linglong noticed Li Yiming’s awkwardness. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Do I </span><i><span style>really</span></i><span style> need to go to the Stage of Ascension?” Li Yiming hesitantly asked. He was already trying his best to come up with an excuse. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course, the exchange system is only available from the Stage.” Eyeglasses was surprised by such a strange question. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh… Well for personal reasons, I can’t really go to the Stage of Ascension.” With the little time he had, Li Yiming failed to find a better explanation. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Personal reasons?’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming’s friends wondered what the exact reason could be, but they all refrained from asking him further, since secrecy was a natural thing amongst guardians. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh…” Qing Linglong hesitated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How about you just join my team? I’m the only member in the team now. I’ll transfer the captain status to you. It’ll cost a few life marks, but it’s no big deal.” Big Beard suddenly took out a tablet and gave it to Li Yiming. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming reached out for the object instinctively when Big Beard handed it over, but he was very surprised. </span><i><span style>‘This is a team token? A tablet?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>He probed the tablet with his focus, and soon, an avalanche of information flurried into his mind. </span><i><span style>‘Team information, member information, domain completion log, exchange sheet…’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Just join the team first, then I’ll give you the leader privilege.” Big Beard took the tablet back and started using it. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Big Beard has invited you to join his team, do you accept?’ </span></i><span style>A voice was suddenly heard inside of Li Yiming’s head. It was just like one of Heaven’s Laws’ notifications when he completed a domain. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Yes.’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming accepted without hesitation. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘You have successfully joined Team Big Beard. You are now an official member of Team Big Beard.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Qing Linglong has joined the team.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Qing Qiaoqiao has joined the team.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Yin Mao has joined the team.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The notifications came one by one. Li Yiming listened to the notifications carefully, but he raised his eyebrow when he heard the last name. “Who the hell is Yin Mao? What a weird name.”</span> <span style><span><a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a> </span></span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Linglong had a smile that faded away after a moment. Qing Qiaoqiao, however, was laughing loudly. Big Beard frowned in surprise, while Eyeglasses turned his head away, visibly not in his best mood. </span><i><span style>‘Wait, so Eyeglasses… No wonder he didn’t want to tell me his name. What did his parents think when they gave him this name? Oh, I can already seen pain and tears in his childhood…’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay, I’ll give you the leader position.” Big Beard repressed his smile, but the twitching on his face betrayed his amusement. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Wang Meng is giving you the captain’s position. Do you accept?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Are you sure?” Li Yiming took a deep breath and looked at Big Beard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.” Big Beard waved his hand. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘You are now the new captain of team Big Beard. Please select a new name for the team.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘A new name?’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming was surprised by the notification. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t really know what name to take.” Li Yiming knew that thinking of a clever name was one of the things he was the worst at. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s okay. Just pick whatever you want. It doesn’t matter,” Big Beard answered Li Yiming with a big smile. It seemed like giving away the captain’s position also meant removing an imposing psychological burden. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“No! We need a good name for the team!” Qing Qiaoqiao yelled. It was her first team, so she was boiling with enthusiasm. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“</span><i><span style>Yiming. </span></i><span style><span>Dissonance. How about that?” Qing Linglong came up with a clever idea. <a id="footnoteref-2" href="#footnote-2">[2]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“A dissonance in Heaven’s Laws? A nice name. I agree with that.” Eyeglasses gave his approval. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t really care. You’re the captain, you decide.” Big Beard’s attitude was made abundantly clear by the way the team was named previously. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This is it! That’s a good name. Li Yiming, </span><i><span style>Dissonance</span></i><span style>.” Qing Qiaoqiao’s eyes glittered with excitement.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright.” </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Team name changed: Dissonance. 10 life marks deducted from the team’s captain’ </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘What? It costs life marks to change a name? Wow, this is a mechanic taken straight out of a poorly-made MMORPG.’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming was unimpressed; after all, a low-level domain usually only yielded thirty life marks.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Alright, if this is the first time you’ve joined a team, then you’ll need some time to play around with the functions in the tablet. Contact me through the team channel for the next domain. I’ll leave for now. Don’t want to stay a minute more in Shangbei. See you!” Big Beard waved his hand and walked toward the exit. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Have fun.” Qing Linglong stood up to see Big Beard off. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming nodded without really paying attention to what Big Beard said. He had already become fully engrossed by what was shown on the tablet. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well, Qiaoqiao and I are going to the salon. Damn that poisonous fog, I think it added a few wrinkles onto my face.” Qing Linglong said after taking out a pocket-mirror and checking herself closely. She led Qing Qiaoqiao out of the room.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll also go relax a bit. I want to see if I’ve lost</span> <span style><span>the ability to... Well, you know, after receiving the virus. Are you coming?” Once the Qing sisters were gone, Eyeglasses took on a lewd smile and looked at Li Yiming. <a id="footnoteref-3" href="#footnote-3">[3]</a></span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s fine. I’ll stay here and have a look at this.” Li Yiming waved his hand. Eyeglasses, as if he had been expecting a refusal, shrugged his shoulder and left while humming a merry tone. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Team information:</span></i></p>
 <p><i style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Li Yiming. Location: Shangbei</i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Wang Meng. Location: Shangbei</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qing Linglong. Location: Shangbei</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Qing Qiaoqiao. Location: Shangbei</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>Yin Mao. Location: Shangbei’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Only the current locations of the team members were shown. The limited information was most likely to grant some privacy to each member of the team. Li Yiming walked into his room and settled down comfortably on the bed before continuing his exploration. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Hmm, there aren’t a lot of functions. It seems like whatever this ‘team’ thing is, it’s not that different from a guild in an online game. The information is shared and so is the loot, so that guarantees sincerity between team members. Also, only a single team invitation is needed instead of multiple individual invitations for entering a domain. Does that mean that I’ll be the one to decide which domain we participate in?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Team exchange?’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming suddenly noticed something. He touched the button with a hand that was shivering a little from excitement. </span><i><span style>‘A shopping website?’ </span></i></p>

   <li><span id="footnote-1">Note, Yin Mao in Chinese is a homophone for “pubic hair”, so you can imagine why LYM would find the name weird. This is something that is much more likely to happen in Chinese, since the way Chinese characters are pronounced (usually 1 sound per character) makes it such that most words are usually only 1-2 syllables long. Names are usually 2-3 characters long, so it happens that a name has the same pronunciation as a common noun.<a href="#footnoteref-1" class="btn btn-sm btn-link"><i class="fa fa-hand-o-left"></i></a></span></li>
