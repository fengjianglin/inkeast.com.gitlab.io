 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Inside the guest room, Qing Linglong had just finished changing into new clothes. She sat down right at the dressing table, visibly bored, and waited until the time seemed right. Then, she opened the door. As she had expected, Guo Tai was standing at the entrance.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms. Qing, I am truly sorry for my butler’s mistake, and I’d like to apologize on his behalf for any inconvenience he may have caused,” said Guo Tai rather earnestly as he bowed down. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It was a simple mistake, Mr. Guo.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Thank you for all your hard work today,” said Guo Tai.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing, we’re just doing our job.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms. Qing, it must not have been long since you joined the security agency, I presume?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Not exactly, seeing as how I joined National Security right after retiring from the army.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? Ms. Qing, you’ve been in the army?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s nothing worthy of praise,” answered Qing Linglong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It must be quite dangerous to work in the Secret Service department, isn’t it?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s relatively low-risk for me. I don’t usually conduct operations personally.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“...”</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Will you say something already? Your son is the one being held hostage by a murderer,’ </span></i><span style>thought Qing Linglong, slightly annoyed.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms. Qing… You said that… There’s a way to save my son?” After a long series of cursory remarks, Guo Tai finally asked.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Well…” Qing Linglong looked at the stairs behind him hesitantly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“May I come in?” Guo Tai immediately proposed. His worries had finally settled down. </span><i><span style>‘This is doable.’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Of course.” Qing Linglong moved away from the door, and Guo Tai entered the room, closing the door behind him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms. Qing, let me make my intentions clear. If you can help me save my son…” The pair sat down on the red sandalwood office chairs. Guo Tai took out a check from his pocket, put it down on the side table, and pushed it towards Qing Linglong.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Guo!” Qing Linglong instantly retreated. “You… Please have some self-respect.” She seemed outraged, with a look of horror at the prospect of the corrupting her own integrity and disappointing the very people she had sworn to serve... </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh…” Guo Tai was dumbstruck, and quickly put the check back into his pocket. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘God, it’s a pain to work with these brain-washed government people…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Ms. Qing… This is a misunderstanding.” Guo Tai explained hurriedly, “I was… Simply overburdened by my worry for my son… I lost my calm…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I can understand your feelings… But…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Xiang’er’s mother passed away early on… He’s my only son… And you could say that I raised him all by myself… It might look like my life is blessed, but…” Guo Tai choked back a sob and his eyes reddened. It was enough to tear up anyone who saw him and distress anyone who heard him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Mr. Guo…” Qing Linglong seemed moved by Guo Xiang’s tale.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“If you know of a way, any way. Please help me save Xiang’er,” Guo Tai snatched Qing Linglong’s hand, very visibly agitated. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Actually... Actually…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Please do not hesitate. If you can help me save Xiang’er, my entire family will remember your kindness, Ms. Qing, and that of the country as well. After what had happened earlier, Guo Tai avoided all mentions of compensation—it seemed like national pride was what counted the most for these people.</span></p>
 <p><span style><span>“Well…” Qing Linglong sighed and looked at the shut door. “According to our data, Zhang Qiang was an orphan, and soon after he was born, he was abandoned by his family during winter. He was picked up by a wandering performer who raised him. Although that performer was someone whose livelihood was dependent on the generosity of passers-by, he was the heir of a clan with extraordinary skills passed on from generation to generation. Of course, something else was also passed on: a moral code, the way of the Jianghu<a id="footnoteref-1" href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>, so to speak. </span></span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.” Guo Tai nodded. It was indeed true that even now, there were still quite a few people like that—individuals who maintained set principles that others would find idiotic.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Zhang Qiang lived with his adopted father since his childhood, so you could say that he’s no exception to these standards.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“But he…” Guo Tai was perplexed. </span><i><span style>‘Then someone like him shouldn’t...’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“After his father died, Zhang Qiang, still quite young, was deceived into going to the U.S.. He went through a lot of trouble for a few years after that and, coincidentally, the navy SEALs welcomed him after they saw what he had learned from his father. During his years spent in service, he became accustomed to the corruption of politicians and the harshness of the world, as well as to witnessing death on a frequent basis. But he always held an unchanged respect and gratitude for his adopted father. Someone from a foreign security agency once found his father’s memorial tablet at the place where he stayed, but he escaped in time</span></p>
 <p><span style>“His current demeanor resulted from the many years he’d spent abroad, but his sense of honor was inherited from his adopted father. That’s why he doesn’t operate domestically.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I see.” Guo Tai nodded. </span><i><span style>‘Quite a rational explanation, these people who walk the Jianghu often have strong patriotic feelings… As to what they do abroad… Well to them, foreigners are nothing more than barbarians…”</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“What does this have to do with Xiang’er? I thought he wouldn’t kill innocents in the country?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t know whether Zhang Qiang would kill innocent bystanders within the country or not, but one thing is certain, he would definitely kill Guo Xiang…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“A debt of blood can only be repaid with blood.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Ugh…” Guo Tai sighed. </span><i><span style>‘Well, I’m to blame for the death of his daughter, so he wants to kill my son. Damn those people.’</span></i><span style> “How exactly am I supposed to save Xiang’er?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“By confessing.” After spending a long while beating around the bush, they had finally arrived to the topic in question. Qing Linglong wiped the beads of sweat off her forehead with a discreet gesture. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Confess?” Guo Tai did not understand. </span><i><span style>‘Who? Me? My son? Zhang Qiang?’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes, a confession. Mr. Guo, a confession from you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Me?” Guo Tai was surprised at first, but quickly grasped what Qing Linglong was trying to convey. Zhang Qiang was someone used to the manners of the Jianghu, and he was also patriotic. As long as he confessed to his own crimes and received due punishment, Zhang Qiang, for the sake of the country, would seek out no more trouble. </span><i><span style>‘We would be safe… But a confession…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“But why wouldn’t Zhang Qiang… Make the police come for me instead?” Guo Tai had a last sliver of wishful thinking. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Those who have power disregard the rules,”[2. Famous quote by Han Fei, a famous Chinese philosopher from the second century BCE.&nbsp;<em>Orators bend laws with sophistry while Xias (as in Wuxia) break the rules with their power.</em>]&nbsp; answered Qing Linglong in a convincing tone. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Of course, things pertaining to the Jianghu ought to be ended in the Jianghu by someone from it. They would never seek the assistance of the government…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Qiaoqiao halted at the exit of the hotel grocery store, pushing her head against the wall as tears filled her eyes. Li Yiming might have forgotten about it, but the communication channel between Qing Qiaoqiao and him had remained open the entire time. Not a single word of what he had said escaped her ears, and, although she suspected that there was something going on between Li Yiming and Ji Xiaoqin, she never could have imagined such a story.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Qiaoqiao was angry at Ji Xiaoqin’s obliviousness to her own good luck and found Li Yiming rather idiotic. But in the end, in spite of herself, her heart ached as she listened to his narration... &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Was I mistaken?” Li Yiming picked up Ji Xiaoqin’s hand and kneaded it tightly in his own, his eyes clearly hinting at an inner turmoil.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>Bang-! </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>The door to the room was suddenly shattered, and pieces of debris grazed past Li Yiming’s head, causing a flurry of wooden shards and cement dust to fall from the walls.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming looked at entrance with shock… </span></p>
 <p><span style>At the door stood a man dressed in black, with his face hidden behind a piece of cloth. A pair of cold eyes glanced apathetically around. His presence screamed danger. Li Yiming, compelled by a burst of courage he himself did not think he had, leaped towards the M4 Qing Qiaoqiao had left on the couch.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in black raised his hand leisurely, shooting purple light out of his palm. The ray flew in a strange trajectory, which somehow allowed it to reach Li Yiming’s hand just as he touched the M4. Li Yiming was blasted away from the weapon as if lightning had struck him. The purple light zapped him and threw him against the wall. He fell down to the floor. The man in black walked towards Li Yiming, who moaned in pain, with a rather strange expression. Li Yiming raised his head with difficulty and looked back at him, but could not do anything more as he remained paralyzed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save… Save me. He’s a terrorist and a murderer. Save me, quickly! I can give you a lot of money.” Guo Xiang squirmed on the bed at the hope of salvation. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in black turned around and scrutinized Guo Xiang with complete apathy.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Save me… please, save me.” Guo Xiang inched closer to the man as he continued his struggle. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in black flung his wrist. Only this time, no light surged out of his palm. Instead, a dagger shot from his hand, leaving behind an after-image. Its tip pierced into Guo Xiang’s forehead. Guo Xiang’s body flew backwards from the momentum, spreading a thin bloody mist into the air as he collided against the bed frame behind him</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘He’s… dead?’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming stared at the two with widened eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in black beheld Guo Xiang’s corpse with disgust and turned his head toward Ji Xiaoqing. He flicked his wrist and a second, identical dagger appeared between his fingers. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Yiming!” Qing Qiaoqiao’s voice came from the entrance. What followed it was the unrestrained automatic fire of the AK-47. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The man in black instantly turned around and leapt out the window with his hands in front of his head. He shattered the glass of the 18th floor and started to freefall. Qing Qiaoqiao dashed towards the window, reminding Li Yiming of just how much of a deadly guardian she was. She stopped right in front of the window, and a bazooka magically appeared on her shoulders. Her movements, from aiming the weapon to firing it, could not have been smoother. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The 21-cm rocket left a trail of flame behind it as well as a gaping hole in the ceiling as it flew towards the man in black in the air with a shrieking noise. The latter, upon hearing the sound, twisted his body into a bizarre posture and somehow managed to squeeze a dodging maneuver out of it. The projectile grazed his back and collided with a car parked on the side of the road. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The loud thud which came out of the explosion shattered many more hotel windows, but the man in black managed to land on the opposite side of the road. Qing Qiaoqiao aimed at him again with her AK-47, but the man’s figure quickly disappeared into the end of the street after a few twists and turns. Qing Qiaoqiao threw her gun down in frustration and finally glanced at Guo Xiang’s corpse and the rather horrible wound he had suffered. She dashed towards Li Yiming and asked him in a worried tone, “Li Yiming, are you okay?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Im… Fine…” Li Yiming managed to squeeze out a response, but his eyes remained fixated on Ji Xiaoqin, who was still laying on the bed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Qiaoqiao read his expression and let out a somewhat frustrated sigh. She stood up, stopped by the bedside, and quickly examined Ji Xiaoqin. “She’s fine.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming let out a sigh of relief and turned his head towards Guo Xiang. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“We have to leave, now…” Qing Qiaoqiao returned to the broken windows and peeked outside.</span></p>
 <p><span style>By now, the clamor of a panicking crowd, with its cries, shrieks of pain and gasps of horror was clearly audible, and one could already hear the sirens of the ambulances in the distance</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Help me get up.” Li Yiming had attempted twice already, but could not manage to do so. </span></p>
 <p><span style>For her slim figure, Qing Qiaoqiao’s strength was very impressive. She picked Li Yiming up from the ground rather effortlessly while looking back at Ji Xiaoqin with mixed feelings. “Should we bring her along?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming opened his mouth to saying something while looking at Ji Xiaoqin, but ultimately shook his head resolutely. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Uh… Yiming?” Ji Xiaoqin had woken up at this precise instant. She gazed at the two people who stood in front of the bed and seemed very confused and lost. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go.” Li Yiming said in a low voice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Qing Qiaoqiao quickly dragged Li Yiming out of the room, and only after they had reached the staircase did they hear Ji Xiaoqin’s screams of horror come out of it.&nbsp;</span></p>
