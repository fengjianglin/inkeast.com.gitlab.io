 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming woke up on the morning of the next day to the familiar sight of the chandelier in the guest room of the tea house. His confusion on how he even made his way back was cut short once he realized that there was someone else lying beside him. The person had long, silky hair, snow-white skin, and a voluptuous body. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘What?’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming instantly activated Thunderflash to flee from the situation, but he was immediately pulled back to the bed before the purple light had barely begun to flash.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming landed back into the burning hot embrace of Liu Meng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Am I that scary? Do you really want to run away?” Liu Meng’s teasing voice was heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this a dream?” Li Yiming looked down at the face he had been dreaming about for so many times over the last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s as real as it gets.” Liu Meng’s eyes teared up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After a long moment of staring at each other, Li Yiming suddenly locked his arms around Liu Meng, squeezing their bodies together as tightly as he could. He did not even bother thinking about how Liu Meng was here or what happened to the Realm of Ghosts; he simply wanted to have a moment of passion with the love of his life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Meng put up a Boundary that covered the entire city, officially announcing the battle of the world’s strongest duo.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?” Pan Junwei jumped up from his sofa and looked up in terror, worried that there was yet another incident.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Even the president who had come with him, reached out for his belt out of reflex, only to realize that he had left his holster in the car.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s nothing. Li Yiming is awake, that’s all,” Bai Ze said nonchalantly. She had her attention more occupied on scrutinizing the president.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘This geezer… He’s not at all like on television…’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there something wrong with Li Yiming?” Pan Junwei’s countenance shifted again as he recalled Li Yiming’s monstrous aura when he was possessed. He did not want to have unwanted complications when he had a guest of utmost importance with him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who knows?” Bai Ze rolled her eyes. She, of course, knew that there was nothing wrong with Li Yiming, but did not bother explaining. The moment Liu Meng put up her boundary, her connection to Li Yiming has been completely cut off.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Tsk! Who do you think I am? You think I’m that nosy?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Should I call for reinforcements?” Pan Junwei quickly composed himself put himself in front of the president to protect him from any incoming danger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Reinforcements, for what?” Bai Ze pursed her lips and sipped her soda.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think we have it under control. I believe Ms. Liu to be capable of handling the matter.” The president’s level-headedness was a surprise to Bai Ze.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I've seen the footage, it seems like Ms. Liu’s strength goes even beyond that of Li Yiming. We should wait patiently.” The president pulled on Pan Junwei’s coat, signaling him to settle down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“But…” Although Pan Junwei was no longer an ordinary soldier, years of training and discipline still left a mark on him. Moreover, he could not afford to put the president in harm’s way in such turbulent times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I think it would be better for you to come on another day. This is probably going to take a while…” Bai Ze suggested. The president went through the trouble of paying a visit, and it would have been disrespectful to make him wait for the “fight” between Li Yiming and Liu Meng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The president smiled back and asked Bai Ze, “I’ve heard that you were the one in charge at Pure Water Herb Hall?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I'm simply here to relay Li Yiming’s orders,” Bai Ze equivocated as she waved for Chen Jiawang, who waited nervously, to come and fill up the tea cup. Pure Water Herb Hall was a tea shop, after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“However, I'd like to remind you that at this point, he's not the one making decisions either,” Bai Ze added as Chen Jiawang came in with a new kettle.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hahaha, of course. Actually, we are here to seek help from Ms. Liu,” The president said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You'd have to talk to her for that.” Bai Ze shrugged her shoulders and pulled a bag of chips from beneath the table. Right before opening the bag, she took out another one and offered it to the president.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you, but I'm too old for things like these,” The president refused politely and picked up his teacup.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright.” Bai Ze opened her bag and started munching on its contents.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, how are the negotiations going?” Lin Lu asked nervously as she glanced at the small sign indicating that the shop was closed for today. The few “pedestrians” around her were actually elite agents trained to protect the president.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has been an entire day already, are they still not done?” The head of the security team, who wore an undervest, asked as he knelt down right next to Lin Lu, his hand on his belt at all times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don't think that he would refuse an offer like that, would he?” Lin Lu said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That's hard to say. It would be quite difficult to execute our plan.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming came down from the second floor only after dusk came. Feeling refreshed and relaxed, he came down looking for some food.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, we have guests?” Li Yiming was surprised at seeing an old man playing chess with Bai Ze. Although the old man seemed familiar, he did not remember where he had seen him before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I don't think that introductions are needed, are they? They’ve been here since six in the morning.” Bai Ze jumped down from her seat. ‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">How can he be this bad at chess? I’m falling asleep from playing!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They're here for me?” Li Yiming looked at the clock, slightly embarrassed. He still could not figure out where he had seen the man before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you okay?” Pan Junwei was still worried about Li Yiming suddenly attacking him. Although Li Yiming’s face was flushed when he came down the stairs, Pan Junwei could see that he was rather exhausted.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m pretty good… This is…” Li Yiming changed the subject.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don't know him?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Should I?” Li Yiming was confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Boss, this is…” Chen Jiawang came with an empty teacup and pointed at the television. The president was seen giving a public speech emphasizing the need for cooperation and hard work to rebuild what had been destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh. Oh!?” Li Yiming’s countenance shifted as he finally recognized his guest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“On behalf of the country, I would like to thank you for your heroic actions,” The president expressed his gratitude as he extended his right arm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I…” Li Yiming found it awkward to be on the receiving end of thanks, knowing full well about what he had done back at Shangbei. It would not be wrong to say that he had barely contributed to the collective efforts of the guardians. In fact, his actions almost resulted in catastrophic consequences.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I hope… &nbsp;I hope that everything’s fine now…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We've started to do clean up work.” Pan Junwei replied. Although the gates to the Realm of Ghosts had been closed, the beasts spawned by it were still roaming the country, and it was up to the guardians to clean them up.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll take care of everything. I would like to ask you, Mr. Li, what are your plans after this?” The president asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Me? I thought Pure Water Herb Hall was dissolved?” Li Yiming surprised at his opinion being sought for such matters, as he did not want to involve himself further with the government. He simply wanted to stay by Liu Meng’s side until the end of time.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It doesn’t matter that Pure Water Herb Hall has been dissolved. You’re still and always will be a guardian. You know this better than me,” Pan Junwei stated sternly. </span></p>
