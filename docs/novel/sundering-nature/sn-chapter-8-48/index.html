 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Half an hour prior, after leaving Chen Quan to return to the tea shop by himself, Li Yiming made straight for Yunding Tower, the headquarters of Yunyu Corporation. Just as he was about to arrive, he received a message on his phone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The buyer is called Zhang Wei. He’s the Public relations VP of Yunyu Corporation.” &nbsp;As always, Eyeglasses was highly efficient in his work.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What a coincidence. Well, that's going to save me some trouble.” Li Yiming smiled as he walked toward the entrance of the skyscraper.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please show your ID.” This time, the security guards were very diligent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I'm looking for someone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“From which department? Do you have an appointment?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell your boss that I'm coming here to take what's mine.” Li Yiming extended his senses upward, but he did not find Yun Yiyuan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir…” The security guard laughed in frustration, thinking of Li Yiming as nothing more than a foolish young man looking to make an impression.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh well, I don't think you have his number anyways. I'm going in.” Li Yiming ignored the security guard and made for the elevator.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sir, you’re going to get hurt.” This time, the security guard was much more gentle and professional.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What's happening?” A voice was suddenly heard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We have a visitor here who's looking for Mr. Yun…” The security guard recognized the manager of his department. He thought that he was going to be in trouble for not kicking Li Yiming out of the building right away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…!” The manager was about to roar out in anger, only to stop himself when he realized that Li Yiming’s face seemed somewhat familiar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming suddenly snapped his fingers, and a purple ark of electricity was discharged in the main hall. Facing the manager, who was a guardian, Li Yiming had far less reserve than when he was dealing with the security guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Can I go inside now?” Li Yiming turned toward the security guard with a smile.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I have good news and bad news for you. The good news is that you can go home early today. The bad news is that you might just lose your job today.” Li Yiming gave his coat to the security guard.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The security guard scrambled for the exit, as if he had just seen a ghost. As soon as he rushed out of the building, a blackout happened. Just as he tried to calm his trembling and wondered whether he should call the police, a gunshot was heard, followed by another one, and then a flurry of gunshots. Having received rigorous training, the security guard could tell that those were not the sounds of handguns being fired.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">But there's no way he could have carried any kind of heavy weaponry on him! Does that mean it's people from the company? I thought we specialized in real estate and luxury goods? Why do people carry assault rifles around here?’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The security guard looked up amidst the chaos, only to see a window shattered into a million fragments. What looked like a giant beast emerged out of the window, only to be sent flying back towards another window by someone with a single kick.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The security guard rubbed his eyes as hard as he could. If it were not for the two giant gaping holes in the building and the downpour of glass shards, he would have thought he was hallucinating.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I should have listened to my dad and stayed in the countryside… The city really is a dangerous place…’</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;The security guard ran into the streets in terror, praying for his own safety.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Li Yiming jumped off a giant lizard, he closed his eyes and extended his senses once again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Seven left…’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He frowned as he made for the twentieth floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did you call for reinforcements?” A middle-aged man holding a knife screamed to a young man inside a reinforced office.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All of our electronics are fried…” The young man held a cell phone in one hand and a gun with his other. In a situation like this, ordinary people like him were mostly useless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit! Who has the guts to come here like this?” The middle-aged man cursed between heavy gasps for air. He was about to burst out in anger at what he thought was false alarm, only for the power in the entire building to go out. He knew that this could not have been an accident, as they had many backup plans.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Just as he rushed out of his office, weapon in hand, a giant hole appeared in the floor. Someone had broken through the floor and the ceiling of the floor and flew all the way to the rooftop. As he looked into the hole, he saw it go all the way down to the eleventh floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Our teams will come back to reinforce us. They'll know that something is wrong with the headquarters.” The young man tried to calm himself down as he put down the phone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Shit! I’ll deal with him!” The middle-aged found his courage when he was reminded that Yun Yiyuan would soon come back. If he was able to last until his arrival, surely he would be rewarded for his courage. Just has a blue glow appeared around his body, and scales begin to cover his skin, a hand pierced through the metal door and snatched his neck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ugghh!” The man was instantly stopped in his tracks, and his eyes widened as he struggled to breathe.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">One light buzzing sound later, and he was turned into a charred corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhang Wei? The VP of the PR department?” A man with a radiant smile came in with a sheet containing information about the managers of the company.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’re… Li Yiming?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The stone tablet.” Li Yiming nodded, walked over the charred corpse, and sat down right in front of the young man.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Zhang Wei did not understand that Li Yiming was getting at.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The one you bought from the stone exhibition.” Li Yiming picked up a box of cigarettes from the desk and lit one up for himself. Only after one long whiff did he realize that he had not smoked for a long while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The young man immediately obeyed, rushing to open his suitcase.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Very nice.” Li Yiming nodded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please…” Zhang Wei trembled even more violently when he remembered that even Yun Yiyuan backed down against Li Yiming back at the banquet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“This is the twenty-first floor.” Li Yiming made himself comfortable on the office chair.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They... they forced me to join the corporation. They said that they were going to kill me if I didn’t… Please… I’m just responsible for buying merchandise…” The young man was on the verge of collapse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I'll let you live. Go tell Yun Yiyuan that this is my answer for his poking around.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Huh?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Do you really want to jump down?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you! Thank you! I’ll deliver your message, I promise.” The young man tripped many times as he scrambled toward the exit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘I’ll spare that one…’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming sighed and threw the cigarette butt into the ashtray. As he looked at the stone tablet on the table, he was certain that it was part of the set of slates which depicted a scene of importance for the future, only he was not sure about the meaning of the scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The tablet depicted a faceless man holding a staff. Unlike the other stone tablets, this one had a radical change in style — the man was sculpted in the way made any viewer feel like he was about to jump out of the tablet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">When Li Yiming put his hand on the staff depicted on the tablet, he found himself transported into a pitch-black place. In front of him stood a dark shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, this again…” Li Yiming’s lips curled up as he had grown familiar with such a scene.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It has really been a long time…” Li Yiming’s countenance shifted as soon as he saw the face of the man. Unlike the previous times, he was not facing Mr. Kong, but himself. </span></p>
