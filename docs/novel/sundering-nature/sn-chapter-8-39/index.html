 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <hr>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mr. Li, I believe you owe us an explanation.” Inside the intensive care ward of the hospital, Li Yiming was being questioned by the National Security agent - it took a lot of self-restraint for him to keep his voice low and stop himself from yelling at Li Yiming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He now bitterly regretted not following Li Yiming to the sauna center against the orders of his superiors. Had he been present, chances are that it would not have turned into a bloodbath. It did not take long before the city’s police came to look for an explanation, especially given that they had just taken over a local station before the incident occurred.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Although the last year had been rife with paranormal incidents which had to be covered up from the public eye, the thirty or so witnesses that Li Yiming left behind made it extremely difficult to keep the lid on the affair, and mounting public pressure only increased the chances of a disaster.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did your superiors tell you?” Li Yiming was unsure how to answer the agent, as he himself did not quite understand how he could have lost control of himself fighting against a small group of mobsters. He had suspected a Heart Trial at first, but immediately dismissed the possibility, as he recalled being completely aware of what was going on. Simply losing control of his body was vastly different from the drunken fuzziness of his memories after being taken over by a Heart Trial.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“My superiors…” The young agent was speechless. As unbelievable as it was, his superiors had told him to do nothing at all. The only orders he received since the incident was to “wait until Lin Lu recovered.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I need to know what happened back there… If you really…” The young agent was not about to give up, as he had a feeling that Li Yiming had the answers which could explain many of the paranormal incidents that had transpired over the last year.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m sorry, but the patient’s awake.” The door to the room was opened as the head nurse interrupted the two, all while avoiding looking at her two guests in the eyes. As the head nurse, she was exceptionally well-versed in profiling. On top of that, she knew from the non-disclosure act she signed the day before that she most definitely did not want to become entangled with Lin Lu, who clearly had an exceptional background based on the number of bodyguards she was able to hire. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Why don’t you go have a look.” Li Yiming sighed and turned toward the hallway.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” The young agent was clearly vexed, but he was in no position to force Li Yiming to confess.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two agents stationed at the front door thought about stopping Li Yiming from exiting the hospital, but they did not dare to intervene. After all, if the information they received was accurate, two men armed with conventional firearms was far too little to restrict Li Yiming’s freedom.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Li Yiming looked up at the azure sky, he took out the half-pack of cigarettes he had kept from a long while back, reminiscing the time he met Mr. Kong for the first time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Mr. Li… I’ve lost the tablets…” Chen Quan suddenly came running, having rushed back to the small convenience store to pick up what he had left there.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve checked?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Quan nodded with a grave countenance, very bitter about the lead breaking off when he was so close to finding out the truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What did the owner of the shop tell you?” Li Yiming asked, fully aware of the importance of the tablet despite seeing it only once.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That he lost it, nothing more,” Chen Quan said with a disappointed voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Did he sell it off to make quick money?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They didn’t lie…” Chen Quan rubbed her hands together. Li Yiming instantly noticed the blood in his left hand’s ring finger’s fingernail.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t harm them. I just used a special technique.” Chen Quan explained when he noticed the attention and shoved his hand into his pocket.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, it doesn’t matter now. As long as you remember the content.” Li Yiming patted Chen Quan’s shoulder. He turned around, only to see two agents running toward him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Secretary Lin wants to see you…” One of the agents said nervously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go see her right away. Come with me, Chen Quan.” Li Yiming acquiesced and invited Chen Quan. He appreciated Chen Quan’s rather odd techniques and thought of them as being potentially useful, even though he was not a guardian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Lu was bedridden with a pale countenance and was abashed upon seeing Li Yiming after what she had just gone through.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you,” Lin Lu expressed her gratitude.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming stayed silent and glanced at the young agent by her side. He pulled over a chair and sat down, ready to discuss the matter at hand.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve got orders.” Lin Lu went straight to the point, but she seemed hesitant to broach the subject to Li Yiming. Although what the latter did was undeniably intolerable, it was also partially for her sake, as she was the one who insisted on going to the stone exhibition.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You can tell me. I know it must be hard for you.” Li Yiming said in an understanding voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Remember the two people who attacked the military outpost?” Lin Lu struggled to sit up, and the young agent quickly rushed to aid her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“One of them is dead.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve tracked down the other one?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ll find his whereabouts soon.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You want me to kill him?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We need him back alive.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming sank into a long silence. Capturing the guardian alive was not the problem — rather, the intentions of the high-ranking officials in the military was where the problem was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If you can take care of him, we’ll take care of the incident at the sauna center.” Lin Lu offered her part of the bargain, despite her personal debt toward Li Yiming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Tell me about his specific location.” Li Yiming stood up and made for the exit of the ward. The world had been changed and perhaps covering up the existence of guardians like he used to do was the wrong approach.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll keep looking for the Shadowless Stone. My promise to you stays the same.” Li Yiming turned around right before leaving and smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Lin Lu’s mood sank further despite hearing the good news.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh yes, you’ve arrested that gang leader, right?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes,” The young agent replied.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to see him.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” The young agent looked at Li Yiming alarmingly, as his first reaction was that Li Yiming sought to exterminate the gang completely.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I want to ask him something… You know what? How about you ask him the question for me? He had three stone tablets. I want to know where he got them. He’ll know what I’m talking about.” After considering the matter, Li Yiming decided to let National Security handle the matter, as they were the ones who had more experience with these types of investigations.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll go take care of this personally and tell you as soon as possible,” Lin Lu used the opportunity to repay some of Li Yiming’s favor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you.” Li Yiming said and left.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chen Quan sat next to Li Yiming in a car which drove away from the hospital. He wanted to ask many questions but decided to keep quiet for the moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ask what you want to ask. You probably figured out a few things by yourself by now, haven’t you?” Li Yiming said as he leaned against the back of the seat, preoccupied by the “wise” words of the fortune-teller.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘My palm lines have changed, and the clue to finding Liu Meng lies within that change… Is that why I lost control of myself as well?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Have I met you before?” Chen Quan finally asked, not knowing where to start.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes.” Li Yiming decided to tell the truth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where? When?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A year ago, in the Tianshan range. We worked together for about a month.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Chen Quan had no recollection of ever going to that place.&nbsp;</span></p>
