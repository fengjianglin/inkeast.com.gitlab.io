 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We’ve found him,” Eyeglasses said as he tapped his desk in the police office.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Really? What’s he doing?” Qing Linglong approached immediately and looked at the footage with a confused look.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Not sure. He’s been talking to himself for a while now.” Eyeglasses had input feed on three different angles. Li Yiming was seen speaking to the air, the young child remaining invisible to the camera.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are we going?” Qing Qiaoqiao asked her sister, who looked at Big Beard in silence.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no point. He’s got it figured out if he’s decided to show up in broad daylight,” Big Beard concluded.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Figured out what?” Qing Qiaoqiao asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“If he was able to avoid our attacks earlier, then he can still do the same now. We can’t force him into a corner unless we give it all we have, and yet…” Eyeglasses pushed up his glasses with a sunken countenance.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Where’s Liu Meng?” Qing Linglong asked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“She went to a bar ten minutes ago.” Eyeglasses switched the input feed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Going to a bar at a time like this? What is she thinking?” Qing Qiaoqiao complained.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We should keep an eye on her. Keep an eye on the other two teams who are targeting Li Yiming. They’re bound to do something soon enough…” Qing Linglong said as she stared at the surveillance screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr" style="text-align: center">* * *</p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As deafening music resounded in the dancing hall along with the cries of people, Liu Meng stared at the glass of tequila whose color shifted as the stage lights from different directions shone through it. After one last glance at the group of young people dancing in the distance, Liu Meng finished her entire cup at once. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Meng refused to believe that the man who walked into the sauna center was Li Yiming. But when she saw him jump off the roof while carrying a naked woman, she felt incredibly angry, but also conflicted, as her ultimate goal was to eliminate Li Yiming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing Li Yiming look back at her through the camera caused such a shock that it felt like all the whirlpool of emotions sealed away by Heaven’s Punishment came back to her. Liu Meng needed to take a break and recompose herself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Meng continued to gulp down her drink, trying to forget Li Yiming, but as she continued to intoxicate herself, the memories of her past only came back clearer than ever.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Are you alone, beautiful?” A fashionably dressed man sat down right next to Liu Meng. He threw his keychain onto the table, which just happened to contain a car key with a flamboyant Porsche logo, and reached for Liu Meng’s shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Leave!” Liu Meng suddenly spat out in a glacial tone. The man instantly froze in place, as he had a feeling Liu Meng would kill him if he were to touch her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man trembled violently in fear, almost falling down to the ground. He heard some laughter in the back and turned around, only to find no one to vent out his anger at being humiliated so. After one last venomous glance at Liu Meng, he picked up his keys and left while muttering a curse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the seventh man who tried his luck with Liu Meng today. Under the influence of Heaven’s Punishment, Li Meng had chosen an unusually sensual outfit consisting of a miniskirt with a low cut along with black stockings. It revealed the tattoo of a rose on her thigh, which, along with her meticulously done make-up, made her an instant eye-catcher everywhere she went.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was especially true in the bar when there were several empty tequila bottles sitting on the counter in front of her.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The failures of the seven men who had the courage to try their luck did not discourage those who observed Liu Meng from afar. Those who were still hopeful were waiting for her to become more and more vulnerable with every drink.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Meng emptied yet another bottle and waved it at the waiter. She continued to drink, aware that it was much harder for a guardian to become fully drunk than a normal person. The waiter looked at her hesitantly and pretended to not have caught her signal.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give it to her. Put it on my tab.” The man with the Porsche keychain threw a pile of cash at the waiter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young Master Feng, if she keeps going on…” The waiter said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give it to her!” The man suddenly said in a low, aggressive voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“More!” Liu Meng tapped at the bar counter with her empty bottle. The waiter sighed and gave a new bottle to a young woman who accompanied Young Master Feng.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon as Liu Meng received the bottle, she began pouring into her cup, but being as intoxicated as she was, more than half of the drink ended up spilling onto the counter. Liu Meng then picked up her cup and emptied it once more. As the searing liquid traveled down her throat, Liu Meng finally hit her limit. The glass hit the counter with a light pop and began slowly rolling toward the edge. It was caught just before it could fall off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You’ve had too much to drink. Shall I take you home?” Young Master Feng put the empty cup down slowly and whispered into Liu Meng’s ears.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A round of sigh was heard in the audience, realizing that they had just missed their golden opportunity.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You…” Liu Meng looked at the man who approached him. The pungent smell of tobacco made her frown, and his hot breath reminded her of someone she was trying to forget.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ll take you home, okay?” Young Master Feng insisted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uhhh…” Liu Meng could not believe that such an erotic-sounding moan could come out of her mouth.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young Master Feng’s body shook from hearing her moan, and he tried as hard as he could to still his boiling desires. Just as his finger grazed Liu Meng’s arm, she sprang up instantly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I just want to help you…” Young Master Feng instantly pulled back his arm, the fear that Liu Meng had instilled in him still vivid in his mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I can walk by myself.” Liu Meng took a deep breath and smiled.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. My car’s over there.” Young Master Feng had more than enough experience to deal with the situation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Meng left the bar, moving unsteadily as she followed Young Master Feng. As the fluorescent pink Porsche made its way through the city slowly, the latter lit up a cigarette while contemplating Liu Meng’s body. He scrutinized her long, slender legs, smelled her sweet aroma, and listened to the soft moans during each of her heavy breathing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Liu Meng’s head was still spiraling. Trying to stay conscious proved to be even more difficult than before with the shaking of the car. She suddenly felt very hot and pulled on her collar, having the impression that she was safe due to the familiar smile she recalled seeing in the bar.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Young Master’s attention was unfailingly attracted by the act and could no longer hold in his desires. He threw his cigarette out of the window and took a quick turn for a park nearby — he did not have the patience of waiting to get home before having a taste of his prey. &nbsp;</span></p>
