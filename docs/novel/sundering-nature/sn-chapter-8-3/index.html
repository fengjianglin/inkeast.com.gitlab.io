 <p>Heh! That title caught your attention, didn’t it? :P Well, I’m not kidding! We present to you <a href="https://www.volarenovels.com/novel/rebirth-of-a-fashionista" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong><span style="font-size: 24px;">Rebirth of a Fashionista</span></strong></a>!&nbsp;</p>
 <p>The male lead is the typical ice cube, ridiculously tall and handsome, confident jerk we see in many novels. Although he appears to be cold and icy, deep down, he’s actually hot and spicy. <span class="fr-emoticon fr-deletable fr-emoticon-img" style="background: url(https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/emojione/2.0.1/assets/svg/1f602.svg);">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;</p>
 <p>Not to mention, the female lead is very quirky and resilient. If you like female leads that don’t allow others to push them around, this is for you!</p>

 <hr>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Young man, I didn’t know that your views were so… conservative. You really should consider adopting a new attitude toward technology.” The man at the stand said with a frown. “This is called big data, haven’t you heard of it? When you go to the hospital now, do they still use the same methods to diagnose you as they did a hundred years ago? Don’t you trust the results given to you by scientific instruments? I’m doing my work carefully now, that’s why I’m taking the time to verify the data using my computer, and you’re unhappy?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well…” Li Yiming found it hard to rebuke the words of the man, but he could not shake off the feeling that something was off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, any more complaints?” The man feigned irritation from not receiving respect. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Please continue.” Although Li Yiming could not take the man seriously, he had no doubt that there was something special about him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Was that so hard?” The man said as he picked up his tablet, subtly letting out a sigh of relief.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The short, obese man who scammed people as a fortune teller was originally a thug who worked a living convincing customers to visit an artifact shop nearby. One day, he stumbled upon a pole with a fortune teller’s banner attached to it, and thought of it as good fun until he was stopped by a desperate man who sought his counsel.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thug, having been working as a kind-of-a salesman, concocted a ridiculous story to try to get the man to visit the shop he was working for. After hearing the thug’s compelling tale about a hard-working rabbit who dug for carrots, the man quickly left, but not before paying two hundred yuan.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thug went home without thinking too much about the incident, until his customer came back a week later, with thirty thousand yuan and a large banner to thank him. In fact, he had been an accountant who was using public funds for private investments, and after listening to the thug’s morale-boosting tale, he decided to further his investment in a desperate bid, only for his stocks’ prices to rebound after a few days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thug immediately understood that this was an opportunity to pursue a newfound career, but he did not know where to start. After trying out his luck and skills at different events, he realized that all of his years spent honing his soft skills as a salesman had born fruit - being talented at noticing people’s emotions was more than enough for him to make a better living than he did as a salesman.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” The fortune-teller glanced at Li Yiming and subtly tilted his tablet so that Li Yiming could not see what was on the screen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened?” Li Yiming, who had been paying close attention to him, asked with concern.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh… I need to check this again…” “The fortune-teller quickly composed himself and made sure to hide his screen completely from Li Yiming’s sight.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘What’s going on? Is my tablet broken?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The screen was completely blank, and he was at a loss at what to do since he had never encountered this problem before ever since purchasing the application. Is this day and age, calculations done on a computer were far more efficient than doing it manually, and it was no exception for practices such as fortune-telling — with the data provided, the results could be just as accurate, if not more than doing it the traditional way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The man hurriedly restarted his tablet and entered Li Yiming’s information, only for the computer to bug out again.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What happened? Is it broken?” Li Yiming realized what was happening.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Uh…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“It’s completely white.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well… I…” The man quickly put his portable computer away as he searched his mind frantically for an excuse to get out of the situation without damaging his reputation.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Your fate…” The man looked up at the sky and let out a long sigh, his double chin rippling like the surface of a calm lake as the wind blew on his face. “How should I put it…”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming was rather entertained by the whole charade and glanced at the white banner in the hopes of finding an accurate way to assess the short man’s true strength.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I should not leak Heaven’s secrets, but since fate has brought you to me, then it must be done…” He suddenly stood up with a severe countenance, as if he was about to face death.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master… I…” Li Yiming’s suspicions of the man grew. If his senses had not been inhibited, he would have simply walked away by now.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You don’t belong to the five elements, not to the Heavens, Earth, nor Hell…” The man suddenly found some inspiration from a toy store nearby which sold replicas of Wukong’s red and golden staff.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming’s expression grew serious and he clenched his fist.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“That’s all I can say. The computer froze for a reason, after all, how can you expect an ordinary object to see the truth behind this world?” The thug could tell right away that he had succeeded when he saw Li Yiming’s chance of expression, and felt a great sense of accomplishment from fooling him with a made-up story inspired from a box of toys.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Master, since you know who I am, then surely you must know why I’m here today. I don’t think that our meeting is a coincidence at all, is it?” After hearing the thug point out his true identity right away, Li Yiming was convinced that he was someone on par with Aunt Wu, who simply pretended to be a normal person.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” Li Yiming’s response caught the fortune-teller off guard, forcing him to think of another lie as a follow-up. He would have thought Li Yiming to be jumping with joy upon hearing his bogus divination, rather than suddenly asking such a question.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘What? Who you are? Who cares about who you are? Unless you’re the city police…’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you for your wisdom, master. Could you please help me with another question? I’ll do anything to hear your words of wisdom…” Li Yiming asked as he bowed down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Seriously? Is this guy crazy or did I reach some kind of new level in swindling people?’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The thug was rather amused as seeing Li Yiming fall so quickly to his ruse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How… can I help you?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’m looking for someone.” Li Yiming took a deep breath. He had an endless list of questions, but he resigned to starting with the most important one.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Who might that be?” The fortune-teller asked with anxiousness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Liu Meng,” Li Yiming said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Liu Meng? A girl? Why is he asking about a girl all of a sudden? I thought he wanted to know more about his career?’&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The fortune teller wondered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. If you know where she is…” Li Yiming said expectingly.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I see…” The fortune-teller played along for the time being as he cursed inwardly.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Why are you asking me? You should go to the police station!’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright… Give me your hand. Let me have a look.” The man sighed and sat down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Thank you!” Li Yiming hurried to sit down as well and gave his right hand to the fortune teller. He could tell from the fortune teller’s expression that the latter was under some kind of difficulty.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Give me your left hand.” It was obvious that Li Yiming had fallen right into the fortune teller’s trap, yet the latter grew irritated at Li Yiming’s eagerness. With his tablet no longer being functional, he had to rely on palm reading, which he struggled to remember even the basics. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Li Yiming stared at his own palm, he suddenly noticed something strange.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘These lines… I don’t remember any of them? What happened to my hand?’ </span></p>
