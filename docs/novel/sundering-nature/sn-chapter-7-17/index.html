 <hr>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After an entire day spent in contemplating on the balcony and finishing off Sai Gao’s pack of cigarettes, Li Yiming finally made his decision: fleeing was no longer an option. He made his way out of the neighborhood after one last glance at Sai Gao and Shao Xian, who were busy working on their nails.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Now that the news of Li Yiming being a sage was known, only the most prepared would still target him. Li Yiming had no intention of staying a prey. Instead, he was ready to take on anyone that Heaven’s Laws was willing to send to his way.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A smile of confidence slowly appeared on Li Yiming’s face as he went onto the streets. He took a deep breath and felt refreshed, ridding himself of all the negative emotions which had been plaguing him for the last few days. However, his complexion soon changed the moment he laid his eyes on a young child standing next to a lamp post.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The child was dressed as if he had just walked out a Taoist monastery, wearing a blue robe and cloth boots. A yin-yang symbol was embroidered on the front of his robe and a figure of stars and the moon on the back. He held a white flag, on which was written “fortune-telling”.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">What took Li Yiming by surprise was the fact that he recognized the young child — it was one of the people who had walked out of the village with Mr. Kong back in Eden. Moreover, in the eight years which have passed since Li Huaibei’s fight in Eden, the child’s appearance had not changed by a single bit.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hello there, are you a fortune-teller?” Li Yiming approached the child with a friendly smile all the while putting his guard up just in case the child attacked him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Yes. Would you like to try?” The child reciprocated the smile.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Of course.” Li Yiming knelt down as if he was an older brother playing with his younger sibling. Rather, he was readying himself to spring out at any moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Alright. What do you want to know about? Career? Love?” The young child’s eyes lit up.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“How about… love?” Li Yiming stared into the child’s eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘His eyes… they’re so pure. I never would’ve guessed he was a guardian if I hadn’t seen Li Huaibei’s memories…’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Love it is then. How about you write out a character for me so I can read your thoughts?” The child searched in his sleeves and took out a yellowed piece of paper and an old brush.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Any character is fine?” Li Yiming asked. He quickly realized that the brush was a guardian equipment and proceeded cautiously.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“As long as you write down something, this brush will connect me with your thoughts,” The child said as he made a pose which made him look like an old monk. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming stared into his eyes. They reminded him of his first encounter with Bai Ze, when she stared back at him. Li Yiming took a deep breath and relaxed himself. After putting down the paper flat, he picked up the brush.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming had never tried calligraphy before, but as soon as he held the brush in his hand, he could feel his emotions stirring in himself. His arm began moving before he was aware of it, and a character slowly wrote itself on the paper without any ink on the brush through methods unknown to Li Yiming. As Li Yiming finished his work, he saw gently traced strokes which somehow conveyed a sense of sharpness, just like the blade of a sword.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The strokes formed a single character: “Meng” — Dream.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Meng?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Dream?” The child stared at the character Li Yiming produced, without minding the latter’s tumultuous emotion.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Could you please enlighten me, sir?” Li Yiming realized that the young child was no enemy of his.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I wouldn’t dare to call myself sir. Little One is enough.” The boy chuckled as he continued looking at the piece of paper.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Dream…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">&nbsp;Yes… there are two ways to look at this. A dream is an illusion, transient, and it vanishes. You’re seeking something which cannot be attained, just like the moon in the water or the flower in a mirror. ”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The flower in a mirror and the moon in the water… What about the other way?” Hearing the fortune tightened Li Yiming’s chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A dream is also a wish, a desire, a will. You wish for the best in love, but it is only a dream. Your wish cannot become true,” The child said.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there anything I can do?” Li Yiming’s heart sank. He knew that his greatest worry right now was exactly as the young child said: Liu Meng’s Heart Trial Punishment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“To dream is to rest under the woods. Yet a phoenix will not do so without a suitable branch. Unable to find a place for her heart, she feels restless.” <span id="footnote-ref-7790"><a href="#footnote-7790">[1]</a></span></span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“No place for her heart?” Li Yiming’s eyes widened.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“A soul exists in all beings, and you can encounter many in a dream. Yet, which one is the real dream? The world you go to when you sleep, or the one you are living in right now? It all depends on where you are looking at.” The child explained with a more serious tone.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Zhuang Zhou Dreams of Being a Butterfly…” Li Yiming was experiencing a whirling pool of anxiety and confusion. <span id="footnote-ref-c716"><a href="#footnote-c716">[2]</a></span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The child packed up his stationary and took out a small toy from which he began to blow soap bubbles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What will you do? Are you willing to live in a dream?” He waved his hand, sending dozens of bubbles flying around, most of which stopped in front of Li Yiming.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Li Yiming scrutinized the bubbles carefully, he saw that each contained a scene from his past. He could be seen laughing, crying, and busying himself with the other platitudes of life.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Or… are you going to wake up?” The child suddenly raised his finger and touched one of the bubbles, popping it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Wake up?” Li Yiming was flustered.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Ping! Pong! Ping!&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As Li Yiming was deep in his thoughts, the wailing of sirens was heard. He turned around only to see two men jump off of a patrol car.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">‘Police?’&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Hey! You can’t…” One man started yelling before he even got off the car, but his sentence was cut short as soon as he saw Li Yiming’s outfit. The latter had borrowed some clothes from Sai Gao, so not only was it a flashy designer clothing, but he also wore a very conspicuous golden watch which undoubtedly sent out a message about his social status.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The two police officers had initially rushed to the scene after seeing the young child’s banner, which suggested at illegal commercial operations, but after seeing how young the boy was, they concluded that it was simply a child playing around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ha… have fun playing with your child…” The officer instantly turned from the usually authoritative figure into a bootlicker.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is there a problem, officer?” Li Yiming said in an angry voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Ah… Ah… Of course not. Please be careful with your child.” The officer came up with a poorly-crafted excuse.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I didn’t know you were responsible for family counseling,” Li Yiming vented out.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“We work on everything, everything. Haha. Alright, we’ll continue on our patrol.” The officer quickly dove into his car.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“He’s not wrong. His duty is to maintain social order.” The young child smiled and blew out another stream of bubbles.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Order…” The word rang a bell in Li Yiming’s mind.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Well, isn’t it the same between countries? Wars started for the sake of maintaining peace?” The child stared blankly at the bubbles floating in the air.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You didn’t come here just to teach me life lessons, did you?” Li Yiming sighed. He still could not figure out the motives of the child but he at least understood the message.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Oh, I just wanted to have a look at you. Didn’t expect you to come up, but I can’t refuse a client who shows up on his own accord. I don’t think what I’ve said should be surprising to you, though. Tell me, why did you come to me so quickly? Is it because of my appearance?” The child continued blowing out bubbles and looked down at his long robe. His status did not allow him to change into less a less conspicuous outfit.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve seen you in Eden.” Li Yiming decided to reveal what he knew, unable to hide the truth from someone who had helped him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“What?” The young child looked up in shock.&nbsp;</span></p>
