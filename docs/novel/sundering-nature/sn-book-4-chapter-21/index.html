 <p><span style>“Bing Shuai.” Ying Mei arrived with a folder. She glanced at the sealed basement door, with a confused look. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Bing Shuai smiled again in frustration. He had just tried to tell his subordinates to keep an eye on the door instead of Fu Bo himself, but even that order could not be imprinted on their minds. </span><i><span style>‘What a terrifying technique...’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Yiming showed up again. We found him in his apartment.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Oh? So he finally showed up? Was there anyone else?” Bing Shuai’s interest was piqued. </span><i><span style>‘You go missing for ten days after I kidnap your friend? Interesting, very interesting…’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“No one else for now, but…” Ying Mei looked at one sheet of paper in the folder. “We’ve just found out that another group of people is tracking Li Yiming. We would’ve failed to notice them had we not&nbsp;taken precautionary measures.’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Other people?” Bing Shuai frowned. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yes. We’ve only realized that a little while ago. They are located in an apartment facing Li Yiming, building number 137. They purchased the property on the second day we brought Ji Xiaoqin back.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“It took you this long to find out about something this important!” Bing Shuai exploded in anger. </span><i><span style>‘They move quickly… and here I thought that they haven’t even mobilized yet. It mustn’t be easy to hide from Ying Mei for ten days. We’re dealing with a scary opponent. Maybe there’s something else, another team that I haven’t discovered yet.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“All of our hands are working on Li Yiming right now…” Ying Mei stepped away, intimidated by Bing Shuai’s outburst, and lowered her head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Put more people around there. Make sure to check the surroundings again. We can’t afford to expose ourselves, remember that we’re probably facing a foe with superior strength.” Bing Shuai took a deep breath to compose himself. </span><i><span style>‘I need to stay calm. Emotional turbulences will only lead to irreparable mistakes. Our enemy is calm and patient… I have to match these qualities.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“As you wish.” Ying Mei answered in a low voice and strode away. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Tian Yan rested on the wooden floor of her room. She could feel its warmth with her forehead, and she smiled shyly as the tip of her nose rubbed against the wooden planks. The light that came from below made her feel warm, made her heart race, made her face flush, and lit up her&nbsp;tenebrous world for the first time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Bing Shuai had intentionally put her bedroom right above the basement, since it was the most appropriate location to sense any changes that would occur below. Right now, Tian Yan was thanking her good fortune; the visitor that had moved into the basement was the person whom she thought about day and night. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Tian Yan had visited Fu Bo the night before.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘What a gentle voice. He speaks so slowly… and his jokes. Hihi. Apparently, he’s an author. It’s a shame I can’t see. Otherwise, I’d ask someone to buy a copy of his book for me. But… why is he here? Is it because of Bing Shuai? It doesn’t seem like he’s been harmed. I… I’m so close to him… Why isn’t Bing Shuai leaving? I want to go see him again.’ </span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Fu Bo sank into the sofa, going through TV channels rather mindlessly. The room he was in was sumptuously decorated, much like a luxury suite at a hotel, with all the food and entertainment he could want, save for the ability to contact the outside world.</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Seems like this is my prison cell. Not sure where I am, or what my kidnappers want. I’ve been rotting here ever since that weird, menacing looking man asked me some weird questions. Oh well, it’s not as if I’m not used to living like that, might as well make myself comfortable. Only Li Yiming… I won’t be able to meet him again.’ </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Speaking of friends, maybe I should thank my kidnappers. I met another new friend. That cute little girl, I remember seeing her at the mall and lamenting her fate…’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Tian Yan visited Fu Bo on the third day of his imprisonment. Fu Bo’s first thought was to try to extract some information out of her, but he abandoned the thought as soon as he heard her speak. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I remember you…”</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming looked up at Yunding Tower, the legendary office building that stood high in Hangzhou. Both Fu Bo and Ji Xiaoqin were gone. The only clue he had was Guo Ying, whom he had met for the first time that day. However, neither Guo Ying or Guo Xiang could be found, so he would need to resort to finding Guo Xiang’s father, Guo Tai, the chairman of Yunlong construction group. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Yiming left his apartment. He arrived Yunding Tower.” In a black car behind him, the muscular man picked up his transmitter. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yunding Tower? What is he doing there?” His mistress was surprised. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s been standing next to a newspaper stand for about ten minutes, and it looks like he’s thinking about something.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you right now?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“In a parking lot right in front of Yunding.” The man did not understand why he was being asked such a question, but answered nonetheless. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“How long have you been there for?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“About eleven minutes.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Leave now. Buy an airplane ticket to the south, treat it as a vacation until I call you back. I’ll get someone to replace you.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why?” The man was surprised. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’ve been exposed.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“As you wish.” The man did not question further. He put down his transmitter and headed straight for the airport. </span></p>
 <p><span style>In the capital, a woman dressed in a traditional robe stared at the birds on her window, her fingers slowly brushing her white jade teacup. </span><i><span style>‘Yunding… Yunlong… Guo Tai… Bing Shuai… Li Yiming, why are you seeking Bing Shuai’s representative? What is your relationship with Bing Shuai?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Number Three’s already gone. Go replace him. Keep your distance and don’t expose yourself.” The woman put down her teacup. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t worry. Unless that Ying Mei shows up… hehe, these small shrimps won’t even notice me if I stood right in front of them!” An amused voice answered her command. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful. It’s Bing Shuai’s base of operations.” The woman frowned and said with a severe countenance. </span></p>
 <p></p>
 <p style="text-align: center;">* * *</p>
 <p></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘It’s been the third time in ten days. What is she trying to accomplish?’ </span></i><span style>Bing Shuai sat in his usual spot with a cigar between his fingers. His attention was on the neighboring room. Beyond the wall, Tian Yan was slowly inching down to the basement by touching the walls. </span><i></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘She’s going down to see him again. Is it out of curiosity? She goes down, peeks at him, and then forgets about him. I guess it wouldn’t be surprising for Tian Yan to be curious about someone she can’t see. The second time could just be her forgetting about it and repeating her attempt, but the third time…’</span></i></p>
 <p><span style>A knock on his door was heard. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Come in.” Ying Mei came into the room with her usual reverence as soon as she heard Bing Shuai. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Li Yiming left his apartment. He’s at Yunding Tower now.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really? What is he doing?” Bing Shuai stopped fidgeting his cigar. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s at the front desk, seeking for a meeting with Guo Tai. He presented himself as a friend of Guo Xiang.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where’s Guo Tai right now?” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s having a meeting in Yunding right now. Twenty minutes until it’s over.” Ying Mei flipped open her folder again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“They know everything about us. I’m guessing he’s looking to negotiate with Guo Tai…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why not you then? Why Guo Tai?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Most likely to avoid an escalation. If anything happens, at least it’ll stay between the representatives. What of the other watcher?” Bing Shuai produced a sinister smile. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He was tailing Li Yiming until a while ago. He suddenly left for the airport after seeing Li Yiming enter the skyscraper. I’ve asked someone to trail him.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“He left? Did we get spotted?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Unlikely. We just switched people when he moved from one area to the next.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s something fishy about this… third party. I can’t tell if they’re Li Yiming’s support team, or if it’s an entirely new enemy. They know about us, and they’re showing their prudence around Yunding Tower.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Keep your distance. If that man is going to the airport to meet reinforcements, then keep paying close attention. If he’s just leaving, then let him go.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Understood. What about Guo Tai…” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Tell him to meet with Li Yiming. We don’t know anything about our enemies yet. Prepare the equipment. I want to have a live broadcast of their meeting.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll set things up right away.” Ying Mei left after a nod. Bing Shuai, however, continued to ponder about the possibilities nervously; it was the first time he faced an enemy he knew nothing about, and this unsettled him greatly. </span><i><span style>‘I should expect reinforcements to come in through the airport. But what if he leaves… then, we’ve been exposed, there's no doubt about it. Another enemy… this is getting out of hand.’</span></i></p>
