 <p></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming stared at the sky for the entire night, completely absorbed by the silvery river that streamed through the sky and the occasional flash of purple light. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘That You Fang guy’s got it right. This is the Dawn of Chaos…’ </span></i><span style>Bai Ze’s final verdict came. Bai Ze was even more shocked than You Fang, since she was much more well-versed in the implications of what she was seeing. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘You know, I don’t really care about this Dawn of Chaos thing. I’m just worried…’ </span></i><span style>Li Yiming continued staring at the sky. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Worried about what?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘I’ve seen this sky before…’</span></i></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘What? Where? How?’ </span></i><span style>Bai Ze was baffled. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Eden…’ </span></i><span style>After an entire night spent scrutinizing the stars, Li Yiming finally remembered what he thought he had forgotten. The sky was the exact same under which Li Huaibei struggled for his life for three consecutive days. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘You’re saying that…’ </span></i><span style>Before Bai Ze could finish, a ripple propagated across the sea of stars, blurring them out. An instant later, and the burning sun appeared once again, hanging high. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The sudden sunlight blinded Li Yiming. When he opened his eyes, he saw that aside from You Fang, who was still asleep, the rest of the team had woken up to the sudden change. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Let’s pack up. Liu Meng, Eyeglasses, head south. Zhang Shanjun, Chen Quan, you’re going east. Shen Jianming, Li Yiming, go north. You Fang and I are going to take care of the west. If you find anything, call the rest of the team before doing anything rash. Head back after one kilometer. I’ll be seeing all of you here.” After a quick breakfast, Lin Lu gave out instructions. Li Yiming’s discovery last night was no small matter, and it needed to be investigated thoroughly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Be careful, okay?” Li Yiming nodded at Liu Meng, exchanged a glance with Eyeglasses, and followed Shen Jianming. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Northward happened to be the direction in which Li Yiming chased the people he had seen the previous night, so he made sure to fully heighten his senses as soon as he entered the woods. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This was where you saw them last night?” Shen Jiaming walked slowly with a handgun ready and an assault rifle on his back. He was taking as many precautions as he could. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“When I saw them, they were standing at the start of this trail, right next to that big rock.” Li Yiming was much more composed, not because he was ignorant of the potential dangers, but rather because he could rely on senses which were sharper than his sight alone. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You’re saying that you saw two people? But there’s only one set of footprints here, and it’s probably yours.” Shen Jianming looked at Li Yiming’s shoes. </span><i><span style>‘But the distance between these footprints…’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve found something!” Li Yiming realized his mistake and was scrambling for an explanation when a cry suddenly came from the east side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go!” Shen Jianming recognized his friend’s voice and quickly turned around. Li Yiming followed close behind. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you find?” Lin Lu arrived around the same time as Li Yiming. Instead of going to the site direction, she raised her assault rifle and looked around with vigilance. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There’s nothing abnormal here. Look as this! Chen Quan dug that out.” Zhang Shanjun came close to Lin Lu and showed her three golden bullet casings.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“This… Desert Eagle rounds?” Lin Lu knew right away, but she still unloaded a bullet from the handgun at her waist to make sure. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where did you find this?” Lin Lu asked Chen Quan. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Over there. Under that tree.” Chen Quan pointed at a pine tree nearby. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Lu walked to the tree in question and knelt down. Chen Quan had been careful enough to not disrupt the surroundings. Lin Lu knelt down as well and started to aim around with her gun. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“There are only two possible angles for firing a round from this place. Zhang Shanjun, Shen Jianming, go look for the rounds.” Lin Lu gave her orders. </span><i><span style>‘These rounds must belong to the second team. But they were well-trained soldiers and wouldn’t easily open fire…’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“From the rust marks, I’d think that they’re from the second team. I wonder what happened…” Chen Quan brushed the grass away with his shovel and searched for more clues. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did you find anything?” You Fang finally arrived. His breaths were short and shallow, and he clung onto his handgun. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Didn’t I tell you that you should never point the gun at a teammate?’ Lin Lu grabbed the gun from You Fang’s hand.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“It’s not like I was going to shoot…” You Fang muttered and walked to the side. </span></p>
 <p><span style>It was not long before the duo sent out to investigate the traces of the rounds fired returned.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We didn’t find anything,” The two said with a defeated voice. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Really?” Lin Lu was surprised. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>“We’ve checked all around. A bullet of that caliber would have left an obvious mark if it hit anything in that area.” </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Did I get the angles wrong?” Lin Lu looked at the pine tree once again. “Let’s check at a different angle. The rest of you, wait here.” &nbsp;Lin Lu said as she and her two subordinates dove into a different part of the woods. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I’ll go help out.” Chen Quan said calmly and walked off with his shovel. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Should we help too?” Liu Meng looked at Li Yiming; they would be much more efficient at searching for clues with their heightened senses. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming shook his head and did not say a world. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The search party returned after one long hour to no avail. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“This makes no sense. The bullets shouldn’t just disappear like that.” Lin Lu’s worry grew as she looked at the three bullet casings in her hand. </span><i><span style>‘This is the first useful clue we’ve found and nothing…?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>“Maybe they aimed at something in the air? You wouldn’t be able to find the bullet so easily then.” Eyeglasses proposed when he saw his teammates return empty-handed. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“That’s the only possibility left,” Lin Lu said hesitantly. However, Li Yiming suddenly leaped in front of Liu Meng and raised his gun.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Lin Lu and Zhang Shanjun reacted instantly. They ducked down and turned around, drawing their weapons, whereas Shen Jianmin rolled to behind a tree nearby. Liu Meng walked forward, and put her hand behind her back, hiding a fiery spark that danced between her fingers. As for Eyeglasses, he vanished, only to appear on a tree branch nearby the next instant, ready to face any oncoming threat. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What is it?” Chen Quan asked nervously. He held a dagger with one hand and pushed You Fang to the ground with his other one. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming stayed silent. He stared forward with a grave countenance and held his pistol still. </span></p>
 <p><i><span style>‘Yiming?’ </span></i><span style>Bai Ze asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You didn’t see?” Li Yiming asked slowly. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“See </span><i><span style>what</span></i><span style>?” Lin Lu asked without turning her head back. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“He’s gone... “ Li Yiming put his gun down. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“What did you see? Explain yourself!” Lin Lu was a little irritated by the same thing happening again. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I saw a man. A man with a bamboo basket on his back.” Li Yiming pointed at a tree about twenty meters away. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“A man? He came down from the tree?” Chen Quan and the rest of the team rushed to the tree and stared into the tree trunk. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where is he now?’ </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I don’t see any climbing marks here.” Chen Quan glanced at Li Yiming, evidently unconvinced. “I’ll go have a look.” He put his dagger between his teeth and quickly climbed up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming stayed silent, but let Eyeglasses know with a glance that there was something terribly wrong. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The only explanation is a hallucination. There’s something here that made him see things that don’t exist.” Two hours later, Chen Quan and Lin Lu tried to make sense of situation while the team was still hiking through the mountain. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I agree. We need to be careful then. Li Yiming is probably the strongest in our team, and yet he still fell for it…” Lin Lu looked at Li Yiming with worry. </span><i><span style>‘This guy… No doubt he’s very strong, but also over-confident. Why would he refuse to take the resistance drug earlier?’ </span></i></p>
 <p><span style>Not only had Li Yiming refused to take the drug specially prepared for the purpose, but he also advised against the rest of the team taking it. In the end, only Lin Lu, her two subordinates, and You Fang injected the drug, and Chen Quan took some pills of his own. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p><span style>Li Yiming walked quietly. He went over the scene where he saw that man in his head. </span><i><span style>‘No. That wasn’t an illusion. I didn’t just see it, I felt his heartbeat with my senses. But what happened? He completely ignored us, and he just left with a smile on his face, just like the people I saw last night. They wore the same kind of clothing, too.'</span></i></p>
 <p></p>
 <hr>
 <p></p>
 <p>Spooky. My money is on Li Yiming taking drugs and getting high without his team knowing.</p>
