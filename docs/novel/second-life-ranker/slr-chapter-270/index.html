They looked like shadows made of black fire, and her Fairy Eyes told her that they weren’t part of the world of the living. At first, she thought they were the undead, but it wasn’t accurate either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Undead beings were cursed creatures who couldn’t die or born to an undead lineage, not resurrected spirits. The undead were still bound to the rules of the living, but the shadows in front of her didn’t have the same restrictions. They were unique, as though they didn’t exist among the rules and laws of existence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heidi, who believed that her Fairy Eyes would show her logical reasons for everything, was utterly shocked. Just then, the Guai that was digging into the brain of the Cannibal Demonic Creature turned its head. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heidi stepped back in surprise. The shadow monster looked like it was going to run towards her any moment.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Heidi!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Captain!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The team members who had survived the Cannibal Demonic Creature’s attack ran towards her frantically, with Dylan and Jun at their heels. Heidi tried to stop her comrades from approaching, but the Guai turned to look at something and then vanished into the darkness.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haa! Haa! Heidi, are you okay?” Dylan grabbed Heidi and checked to see if she was alright.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Heidi didn’t say anything. She just looked at the spot where the Guai had been with her Fairy Eyes wide open.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wh-what is this?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aacck!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unlike Heidi and her team, the base of the Ninety-Second Squad where Ibrahimovic waited was completely annihilated. They couldn’t stop the excited Cannibal Monster Humans, Cannibal Demonic Humans, and Cannibal Demonic Creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cannibal Monster Humans killed the ordinary players while the Cannibal Demonic Humans took care of the more skilled ones. The Cannibal Demonic Creature only continued walking.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom. Boom.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ground shook with each step it made, and its red eyes flashed as it searched for something. It crushed the forest, breaking trees in half as it passed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ibrahim held his breath in fear under some mossy rocks as he hid far from the Cannibal Demonic Creature. His crushed right arm throbbed, but the fear that trickled down his back numbed his pain. ‘Hoarder! You…!’ Ibrahimovic ground his teeth thinking of Yeon-woo, who was to blame for all this. His plans had been reduced to ashes as soon as the messages arrived about the Cannibal Demonic Humans and the Cannibal Demonic Creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The players of the Ninety-Second Squad had died like insects: stepped on, blown away, and toyed with. He’d run towards the Cannibal Demonic Creature to try to stop it somehow, but he’d only injured its pinkie finger while his arm had been destroyed. However, he’d managed to infuriate the creature, and it was now looking for him, sniffing for a trace of his presence. Ibrahimovic had hidden his scent with an artifact, but he couldn’t erase every single trace of himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The distance between them was shrinking, and he was in danger of being caught. He had to leave the island before that happened. ‘A boat! I have to get on a boat!’ In fact, Ibrahimovic had a secret boat his subordinates didn’t know about. It was only a small canoe, but Charon had made it. Ibrahimovic decided it would be wiser to escape and request help from the Fantasy Regiment. ‘I’ve already contacted headquarters. I just have to find the coordinates!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ibrahimovic quickly racked his brain. He felt sorry about sacrificing his subordinates, but someone needed to leave the island to request help as soon as possible. The canoe wasn’t too far away, and he’d hidden it among thorn bushes so that no one would find it. ‘Please, please.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ibrahimovic looked around warily as he heard footsteps come and go. He found himself dashing through the forest without any plan. There was no time for it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&lt;Speed Wind&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a priceless skill he had bought for emergencies like this, and he could escape from danger with explosive speed. Although it used up a vast amount of magic power, it was worth it. He could sense the Cannibal Monster Humans chasing after him, but he evaded them easily. ‘Yes!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ibrahimovic was sure he would succeed. Although the Cannibal Monster Humans were fast, they slowed down as soon as they left their territory. He could no longer feel their presence or those of the Cannibal Demonic Humans. Up ahead, he could see the large rock he’d placed as a marker to show where the territory of the Cannibal Demonic Creature ended. The canoe that he had hidden under the bushes was somewhere close to that marker. ‘I’ve survi—!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as Ibrahimovic sighed in relief, a large shadow crushed the rock, and a hand stretched out towards the shattered pieces to grab Ibrahimovic’s neck. The Cannibal Demonic Creature looked at him in amusement. What happened? Ibrahimovic saw a bloody mess dangling in the Cannibal Demonic Creature’s left hand. He almost couldn’t recognize him, but it was the subordinate who had always protected him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cap…tain…I’m…so…sorry!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know if his subordinate was referring to the canoe or the rock, but it was obvious that he had given up the location. The Cannibal Demonic Creature suddenly spoke, making Ibrahimovic’s mind go blank. “I’ve found you, rat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fear exploded inside Ibrahimovic. ‘H-he can talk?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;“Urk!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Cannibal Demonic Creature didn’t care about Ibrahimovic’s reaction and just tossed him to the ground. Ibrahimovic felt like his body was breaking apart. He used different skills, but they all scattered against an invisible barrier before they could reach the Cannibal Demonic Creature. ‘Fuck…it’s resistance.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was the scary part about Cannibal Demonic Creatures. They had high resistance and so much power that they could eat most players easily.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom! Boom!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp; “Heehee! Whee!” The creature threw Ibrahimovic to the ground several times in amusement.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ibrahimovic’s arms and legs were crushed, and his internal organs were ruptured. Blood poured out of his cracked head, clouding his vision. Would he die so pointlessly? Ibrahimovic wanted to endure, but his consciousness was slowly fading away. However, right before he passed out, he felt his body being flicked away and he rolled on the ground. &nbsp;</span></p>

The Cannibal Demonic Creature was trembling in fear. “Monster! Monster! Go away! Go away! Monster! Aaaack!” It shook its fists, but the black shadow avoided them and turned the Cannibal Demonic Creature into a bloody mess in seconds.&nbsp;</span></p>

Just as Ibrahamovic had been terrified by the creature, it was terrified of the shadow, which seemed to be pushing it to its death.</span></p>

Just before he exhaled his last breath, he saw the Cannibal Demonic Creature’s head fly into the air spurting blood.</span></p>

They all tried to put the fire out with water, but the fire just grew bigger and swallowed everything in its path.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The crops and fruits that they had grown so carefully the past year instantly turned to ashes, and their cottages were scorched into charcoal.

However, another disaster was waiting for them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A whirlwind emerged from the black fire: Yeon-woo. He moved rapidly to get rid of the Cannibal Monster Humans in his way. He didn’t even have to pull out Vigrid or use his Black Aura, and he killed them all with just his Magic Bayonet. He massacred them, and they couldn’t even fight back.</span></p>

I’m going to kill you, human!” A few Cannibal Demonic Creatures ran towards him but he dispatched them easily as well. When he swung his sword, a creature’s fist flew out like a piece of straw, and when he swung it another time, a creature fell to the ground, its throat cut.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“H-how…?” It was a bloodier sight than when Ibrahimovic had been ripped apart. The Cannibal Demonic Creatures all met anticlimactic ends. ‘They’re too weak.’ Yeon-woo stepped on the corpse and jumped forward. Blood spread out and evaporated from the heat.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Cannibal Demonic Creatures and Cannibal Monster Humans continued to rush towards him, but they were no match for him.

His brother had been annoyed at fighting them, after all. However, their attacks were so insignificant that he hadn’t even awakened his powers. It was just like his fight with Apophis’ exuviae.&nbsp;</span></p>

It was the location of the chief’s residence. Yeon-woo spread his Fire Wings and flew over the River of Souls, and using Wind Path and Blink, he slid over the water and arrived at the island.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crunch.

The creature sensed Yeon-woo’s presence and turned his head. His red eyes narrowed fiercely. “So, it’s you. The one who hurt my children.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo put his Magic Bayonet away and pulled Vigrid out. As he swept his black Aura around, he wondered if the creature was weak or strong? His brother had definitely said he was strong. Jeong-woo said he’d struggled and had only managed to beat him with the help of his comrades.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If that were the case, how would Yeon-woo fare?

Acidic fog settled down, and it seemed like it would start to rain. It was the trait of a being that excelled at using Fear Water. Yeon-woo kicked off from the ground in annoyance. “Blah-blah, you talk too much.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>

Blood spurted out and evaporated in the heat. ‘He’s just the same.’ Yeon-woo sighed. Apophis’ exuviae and the Cannibal Monster King had fallen easily to his Aura. ‘I guess there’s nothing I can do except climb to the higher floors quickly.’</span></p>

I should find Lana and quickly get through this. Gosh.’ Yeon-woo decided to switch his priorities. At first, he’d planned on taking everything he could and slowly climb the Tower, but there wasn’t any need for that anymore. It was better to just find what he needed and move onto the next floor.&nbsp;</span></p>

Yeon-woo was only interested in the elders. The Cannibal Monster Humans were naturally gifted warriors, shipwrights, and boatmen. The older ones knew the secret to crossing the River of Souls.&nbsp;</span></p>
