Something flashed in Duke Tuan Tien’s eyes. ‘This is…’ He truthfully hadn’t been expecting much on the way to the forty-second floor. Although it wasn’t publicly known, the Blood Land was facing a grim situation as White Dragon steadily escalated against them. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">White Dragon was stronger than expected, and their leader, the Spring Queen, was monstrous. The Gluttony Emperor had immediately tucked his tail between his legs after realizing their predicament, and their allies were leaving one by one. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No matter how fiercely the Blood Land tried to resist, White Dragon’s attacks took up their attention, and they couldn’t look elsewhere. Black Dragon, who was now observing the situation, was a problem too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, they happened to hear that the Hoarder had finally reappeared. The Blood Land suspected he had gone into hiding out of fear when the war began, so they were displeased. However, they needed any help they could get. Normally, they would have sent a messenger who was either a count or viscount, but the situation was so urgent that Duke Tuan Tien had come himself.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, once he met the Hoarder, his negative thoughts began to change. The Hoarder’s power was greater than he’d expected. He heard that the Hoarder had been victorious in the fight on the Five Mountains of Penances that involved many rankers, mercenaries, Necropolis, and others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, because it had happened on the lower floors, he’d disregarded it, thinking that it was simply an embellished tale. Now that he could see the Hoarder’s ability with his own eyes, he realized how wrong he had been.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Hoarder’s subordinates alone were decimating the magic alliance’s war mages and the Head Cutters.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘If he’s at this level now…he’ll be a Lord soon. Or has he already reached it? He might become like the Vampiric Lord someday.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Vampiric Lord Bathory, to whom the Summer Queen had been compared, had nearly ruled the Tower. She sucked out the life of anything that touched her and could take familiars just by blowing her breath into them. Because of this, death always followed the Vampiric Lord, and her familiars could create mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whenever a skilled player became her familiar, her rivals were on edge. No matter how much they cut down her forces, she replenished them easily. Her comrade of yesterday could be her enemy the following day.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Finally, an alliance of clans was so threatened by her that they chased her to her region in the Tutorial to stab her to death. However, the horror of the Vampiric Lord still lingered in the Blood Land.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duke Tuan Tien thought Yeon-woo would one day reach the level of the Vampiric Lord since he was skilled enough to be one of the Martial King’s disciples, and his own familiars were fearless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘From what I can tell, he’s at the level of a count or marquis. With the power of his familiars, he might even be a duke. Good. I have to get him on our side.’ Yeon-woo had all the requirements to jump into battle right away. In the future, he would grow even stronger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he completed his calculations, Duke Tuan Tien put on a bright expression and gave the skeleton insignias he’d collected to Yeon-woo. “It seems like you need this; I’ll give them to you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I accept them gratefully.”</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[You have made an achievement that is not easily accomplished. Additional karma will be provided.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[You have acquired 50,000 karma.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[You have acquired an additional 30,000 karma.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duke Tuan Tien had been on the red team, and Yeon-woo didn’t ask how he managed to gather all the insignias. The Blood Land members weren’t one to get things done with words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, I should have brought a nicer gift since you are His Majesty’s friend, but because the situation is urgent, I hope you forgive me for this rudeness.” Duke Tuan Tian bowed courteously as though he were truly sincere. His etiquette was impeccable. Players who knew the Blood Land would have been shocked to see him. Members of the Blood Land were known for being elitist, and it was unimaginable that they would have such respectful attitudes to outsiders.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo’s lips were twisted in a smirk as he watched. ‘They must be under a lot of pressure.’ He’d been planning on interfering in the battlefield anyway, but if they wanted to come like this, he was ready to welcome them with open arms. ‘However, I don’t need to give in easily.’ His smirk deepend. ‘I have to get what I can.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His eyes flashed behind his mask. ‘And I should reset the game to my taste.’ He didn’t plan on just dominating the Blood Land and White Dragon. Yeon-woo had a bigger picture in mind. He wanted to create a deep pit where all forces in the Tower would fall in. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duke Tuan Tien was the right person to help him get this done. Since the duke seemed to have something on his mind, all Yeon-woo had to do was toss him the bait.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">「</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whew, another victim for the conman has shown up.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As I promised, I’ll help you to the best of my abilities.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Duke Tuan Tien’s expression grew even brighter, but then it changed after Yeon-woo’s following words.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But as you can see, I’m not in an easy situation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ah.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo was still on the forty-second floor, but the battlefield of the large clans was on the sixtieth and even higher. It was natural for them to stay on the upper floors. The battle between Red Dragon and the Cheonghwado that had occurred on the eleventh floor was an anomaly. Duke Tuan Tien didn’t realize that it was a result of Yeon-woo’s scheming, although he did think it was strange.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Blood Land had assumed Yeon-woo was a ranker all this time. After all, who would think he was a lower-floor player based on his accomplishments? However, it was difficult to make him climb to the higher floors quickly. No matter how outstanding he was, some trials simply required a lot of time. “I can help you until the fiftieth floor. Our kingdom has a method of clearing floors, and we’ll support you with anything you need.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo’s smile deepened. ‘It’ll be a good chance to peek at their strategies and plans.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Each large clan had a secret method to clear the floors which revealed their strategies and courses of action. They guarded this secret religiously since its revelation would mean that everyone would find out about the clan’s main forces. Yeon-woo would take it gladly if Duke Tuan Tien offered it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could lie back and clear the floors easily while studying the Blood Land’s weaknesses. They didn’t know that they would be showing him their vulnerable belly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He could even find hidden pieces the Blood Land knew of that his brother hadn’t been able to discover. ‘And the artifacts that come with them will be a plus. I’ll be able to acquire the Skeleton King Tablet faster than I thought.’ The floors that numbered in the forties contained the legacies of a being called the Skeleton King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not much is known about the Skeleton King—just a few legends that have passed down. Some say he existed during the time of the Draconic species and disappeared because of a curse from the last Giant king. There’s another rumor that he made a contract with otherworldly gods.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the tablet that you can make after gathering all his legacies is very nice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jeong-woo had learned about it through the special benefit. Learning about the Skeleton King could be very helpful. He had the folklore of the Giant species, which was rare in the Tower, and had made connections to gods of other worlds.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Boo will use it well if he has it.’ Even though he didn't state it, after remembering his identity as Faust, Boo desired to return to those days. Yeon-woo wanted to give Boo the Skeleton King Tablet so Boo could grow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The first things he needed in order to complete it were the skeleton insignias in his hand. He had twenty in his hand now, and he had to collect all 100 of them over the next five days while progressing with the trial. The other materials were also spread around the other floors numbering in the forties. He’d been expecting that it would take him some time to clear the stages as he collected the materials, but if he had support, things would go faster. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not realizing Yeon-woo’s dark thoughts, Duke Tuan Tien continued, “However, as you’re aware of, our assistance won’t be possible on the fiftieth floor. Of course, I’m not saying that you won’t be able to pass the Wailing Wall on your own, but we won’t be able to help you then. We also don’t know how long it will take you to clear it.” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo nodded. As the duke said, the famous Wailing Wall of the fiftieth floor wasn’t a place that just anyone could pass. It was the motherland of the Draconic species that had become totally extinct with the death of the Summer Queen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">To current players, it was famous as a historic site of Draconic species. As befitted a place that was left behind by the dragons, there were more unexplored places on that floor than explored ones. There wasn’t a specific method to clear it, and each player was given different trials, which made it even harder. Still, those who passed through this floor were called “rankers” and acknowledged as true players.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, to Yeon-woo, this place had another significance: ‘It’s where the ancient dragon Kalatus has fallen asleep.’ He only heard his voice during the first Dragon Body awakening, but Yeon-woo thought that he might still be alive. No one else could have sent Jeong-woo to Earth. What was more, at some point, Yeon-woo had felt as though a being from afar were watching him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Halphas looks at you with interest.]</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was just a gaze that never revealed a name, but it felt familiar. It didn’t have the same energy as the gods or demons, and Yeon-woo guessed that it was Kalatus or some being related to him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was going to reach the fiftieth floor using any means possible. However, he would face a problem when he reached it. ‘It’s not easy to enter the labyrinth under the Dragon Temple.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Dragon Temple had a hidden stage that most people didn’t know about.</span></p>

The mausoleum of the first Qin Emperor is probably something like this. Or the pyramids of the pharaohs. That was how grand the haven of the great, ancient dragons was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jeong-woo wouldn’t have discovered it without Kalatus’ guidance either. It was his grave, which was commonly called the Dragon Labyrinth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo planned on opening this location, but he couldn’t do it without the permission of its owner. That meant Yeon-woo had no other choice. ‘I’ll have to force it open.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As to be expected of a haven, the Dragon Labyrinth had several guards and traps which Yeon-woo would have a hard time dealing with. The close one got to the center, the more dangerous it would be. ‘But if I have chess pieces to move, that changes everything.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo was going to use the Blood Land to help him enter the Dragon Labyrinth. He believed he could bait White Dragon and force the escaping Black Dragon and Green Dragon there too. As self-proclaimed successors to dragons, they would find it difficult to resist the haven of an ancient dragon. ‘It’s also attractive for the Devil Army and the Elohim.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Nobody knew what the ancient dragon might have left behind, so rankers would be pulled in as well.</span></p>
