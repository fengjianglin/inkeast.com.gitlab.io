 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bow God, Jang Wei, clucked his tongue as he looked at the bloodied person cowering at his feet. He had taken a wrong step again. How many mistakes had he made by now? It had already been half a year since he accepted a new job from the Summer Queen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jang Wei had investigated Bahal, thinking that he’d uncover something related to the troubles facing Red Dragon. Since Bahal wasn’t well-liked by anyone, Jang Wei had to investigate quite a lot of people.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’s managed to catch three of the Eighty-One Oculus engaged in suspicious activities. Although they were insignificant, the Summer Queen had been furious and ordered them to be beheaded. Still, Jang Wei still hadn’t found any other secrets. He did notice that a player named Cain kept popping up. Bahal had cherished him, and the rookie was supposed to be extremely strong and contributed to finding the Saber God’s son. ‘However, it’s impossible for a nobody to have anything to do with this. Also, he entered the Foreign Legion after the war began. He’s too clean. He has no connection to anything else.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Summer Queen believed that a faction of Red Dragon and the Cheonghwado had been colluding, which meant that plans were being set in place for a long time. On the other hand, Jang Wei thought that the other Eight Clans had something to do with the situation. It was only logical.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was nothing to pin on Cain, the Hoarder. He’d completed the Tutorial not too long ago and didn’t have enough time to get involved in a faction. His accomplishments on the different floors were also clear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Also, the Summer Queen didn’t seem to want to get involved with the One-horned tribe, and everyone knew that Cain was sworn brothers with the Martial King’s children. He was even a disciple of the Martial King. The Summer Queen refused to take any reports about Cain, and Jang Wei was also beginning to think it was a dead end and set aside his doubts about Cain. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides, he still had a lot of other suspects to go through. However, even as he investigated their ties to other clans and examined all the evidence down to the tiniest details, he couldn’t find anything. Did the culprit cut off their tail cleanly and run away? He was starting to think that the Summer Queen was right and there was a mastermind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone in Red Dragon and among Bahal’s followers was cleared now, but the Eighty-One Oculus were the only ones satisfied with this. The Summer Queen and Jang Wei were both dissatisfied. Jang Wei trusted the Summer Queen’s intuition since the Draconic species were famed for their eyes, which could see the truth. ‘Although it seems like that intuition has been smothered now.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Where was he supposed to go now? Jang Wei ended the life of the player and sat down in a chair, deep in thought. He had a feeling that the mastermind had been aiming for an item and had gotten involved with Bahal because of it. But what if he was wrong. What if it was a personal grudge, and they’d only managed to find out about the item in the process? It was unlikely, but he didn’t have any other theories.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides, there were a lot of people who held grudges against Bahal, the most famous ones being: ‘Arthia.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The impact of Arthia still lingered in Jang Wei’s memory. As the Bow God, he almost lost his life while battling them. They didn’t have a lot of members compared to other clans, but each member was strong enough to stand out. ‘Although in the end, they were all blinded by greed and stabbed each other in the back.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that the members had become each other’s enemies. Could this be related? He didn’t have any evidence, but perhaps it was worth investigating. No one else knew Bahal better, and they were all in influential positions in other clans. However, there were too many potential people to investigate. He had to choose one to start with.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jang Wei looked through the information window the Summer Queen gave to him and found something that stood out—Teacher: Dwarf Henova</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘The Anvil of Fire, one of the Five Artisans?’ He was one of the top blacksmiths in the Tower, but everyone had turned their backs to him because of his relationship with Arthia. Jang Wei thought it would be best to start from there and proceeded with his inquiries.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five hellhounds each about two meters tall came running at Yeon-woo. They were extremely fierce and tough, the hellfire they spewed hot enough to scorch the walls. Most players would have collapsed from fear.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘They don’t get along with me.’ Yeon-woo ran with Carshina’s Dagger, condensing Aura along its blade and making an explosion with Holy Fire and a bit of black energy. He felt as though his focus moved along with his blade, and all his different abilities were combining as one. It was a power that focused Aura and black energy in every stroke—a form of Bian.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Three of the hellhounds were incinerated, and the other two were severely injured. The dungeon quaked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[You have successfully comprehended the 3rd Bian, ‘Swe’.]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Comprehended Bian: Jeol, Hon, Swe.]&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo was now clearing the second door. He didn’t just try to defeat the simulations but also trained in the Bian. ‘It would be stupid not to take advantage of all these sparring partners.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With all the training, Yeon-woo had managed to learn Hon, which in turn let him learn Swe. He could now direct condense energy to explode and reduce his environment to rubble. However, it wasn’t as efficient as he’d been in the Monkey King’s Palace. Perhaps he was too tense now or maybe it had something to do with the limits of the twentieth floor. At any rate, at least he could finally understand them, and he was now trying to perfect them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He still wasn’t completely used to the first Bian, Jeol, and he had to focus whenever he used it.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Three monster birds attacking from above were ripped to shreds as he lifted his sword.</span></p>

Even though he was only a simulation, he was clearly taken aback.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hanabi was known as the “King of Demonic Creatures” in the Tower. He was the final descendant of an organization that served the Devil King, and he was famous for raising dead creatures. He was quite similar to Boo, even when it came to his personality and skills.</span></p>

Training wasn’t the only benefit of the twenty-first floor. It was also a chance to peek at the skills and strengths of the other players.</span></p>

The fifth door had taken ten minutes, the fourth door thirty minutes, and the third door about an hour.</span></p>

Also, he was incorporating his Bian training and tried to memorize how the shadows fought, just in case. He was drenched in sweat, and he could taste iron in his mouth. He’d fought over 100 players without any rest.</span></p>

Cure.’ He activated the rune magic engraved on his left arm to heal and lessen his exhaustion. He stood still for half an hour until his mind was clearer, then he headed towards the last door.</span></p>

It was clear that after he cleared this floor, things would become noisy again. He didn’t want to become famous, but if he couldn’t avoid it anyway, it was probably better to be as loud as possible.</span></p>

It was different from what he’d seen behind the other doors. Instead of rooms, Yeon-woo was standing in a wide field surrounded by mountains. It felt like a space where he could rest and run away from his opponents. However, the restrictions of a limited space were no longer there, and players would be able to use their skills to the fullest. The difficulty of the first door truly surpassed all the others’.&nbsp;</span></p>

You either survived or died. He wouldn’t have time to study the shadows as he had with the previous doors—it was a way the Tower showed respect to the shadows of the first door.</span></p>

Yeon-woo knew this, and so he’d taken time to rest first. He would be meeting real monsters now, and he was planning on using everything he had, even Dragon Blood.</span></p>
