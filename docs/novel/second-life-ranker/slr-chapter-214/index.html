Victoria was a rune magician who was known widely throughout the Tower. As one of the top five artisans, she probably had a lot of knowledge in different areas, and she would definitely be a great help.</span></p>

However, isn’t it possible to do that with runes?</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">」</span></p>

However, there was an important problem. “I’d like to find her, but I don’t know where she is. Do you have any idea where she might have gone?” After the commotion on the twentieth floor, Yeon-woo had searched for Kahn and Victoria but he hadn’t turned up anything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">「</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’m not too sure, but there is a way to find out.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">」</span></p>

If she’s trying to hide, it’s likely she’s gone back to that teacher.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">」</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">「</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I only remembered it now as I was thinking of Victoria. Sorry about that.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">」</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His connection with Rebecca told him she was telling the truth. However, it seemed like she wasn’t telling him the entire truth. Still Yeon-woo didn’t press her. Since she was only a vestige, her memories were muddled, and it was a relief that she at least remembered this much. Furthermore, even though Rebecca was bound to Yeon-woo, she hadn’t completely opened up to him yet.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he considered how close Rebecca and Victoria had been on the Mountains of Penances, it made sense that Victoria would tell Rebecca what her plans were in case of an emergency.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where can I find her teacher?” However, as soon as Yeon-woo heard Rebecca’s answer, he scrunched up his nose. “What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re saying there’s a great sorcerer here? I really can’t believe it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! It’s awesome here, what’s your problem? Wowww! Hey, check that out. Incredible, look at those curves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you wanna die?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Edora narrowed her eyes at Phante. But Phante ignored her and continued staring around him. They were in a famous entertainment district full of red buildings. In the doorway way of each building, a woman in revealing clothes stood waiting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were all kinds of prostitutes, night clubs, and even drugs, which made Edora feel uncomfortable. Although there were places that women could visit, too, she didn’t like the idea. It was too frank and uncivilized, and the desire that filled the street was unpleasant to her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She had only come here because of one person, the one standing indifferently next to her. Edora glanced at Yeon-woo, was wearing his black mask and standing around in a relaxed manner. Whether it was because of his toned body or firm eyes, some women looked his way seductively, and others even grabbed his sleeves. However, Yeon-woo didn’t move and simply brushed them away like annoying flies. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As time passed, more people gathered around, amused by his reaction. However, Yeon-woo stood his ground. While Edora thought it was a relief Yeon-woo was like that, she ground her teeth thinking of how late the person they were meeting was.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The truth was that this kind of environment wasn’t unfamiliar to Yeon-woo. Back in Africa, the soldiers under him liked to release their stress through various ways. Since he was their leader, he also went with them, but he never really enjoyed it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the time, he had been dating someone, and he didn’t understand why people liked these kinds of places. His subordinates had teased Yeon-woo about being a prude, but Yeon-woo didn’t care.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It wasn’t that he felt uneasy, like Edora. To him, there were different kinds of lifestyles, and a place like this was just another example of how humans lived. Yeon-woo didn’t really care too much about it. The only thing that interested him was that a sorcerer lived somewhere here. ‘A sorcerer…’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Almost a year had passed since Yeon-woo entered the Tower, and he’d met countless players but not a single sorcerer. It was proof of how rare they were and how specialized their area of magic was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">While most people assumed that sorcery was classified under magic, this was bitterly disputed by magicians, who took their magic from the mana stream, unlike sorcerers who borrowed their power from spiritual beings. Magicians looked down on sorcerers as servants who couldn’t do anything on their own, while sorcerers despised magicians for not seeing the value of sorcery.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There were different types of sorcery, and they were similar to Apostles, who borrowed the strength of gods, or black magicians, who signed contracts with the demons. However, Apostles and black magicians were restricted when it came to borrowing power, but sorcerers had no such limits. They even used power from beings that were neither gods nor demons.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, because they weren’t bound to just one source, they had several disadvantages. They couldn’t pass down their power to their progeny, and it was extremely difficult to succeed. Yeon-woo tried to remember if he’d ever heard of anyone who was powerful enough to be Victoria’s teacher, but no one came to mind. ‘Who could it be?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Of course, it could be someone he or his brother didn’t know. The history of the Tower was long and many skilled people were around. However, if the sorcerer really lived in a place like this, as Rebecca said, it was likely that their personality might be tough to deal with, and he would have to take special care. ‘And it seems like people have started to guess who I am.’ The Large Clans had probably heard he had left the One-horned tribe’s village by now. He didn’t have to be wary of them, but there was no reason to get involved in skirmish either.</span></p>

A group of people was rushing towards them, and the prostitutes who had been stalking Yeon-woo ran away. Even the servers and the customers all lowered their eyes and went somewhere else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Phante and Edora’s expressions turned strange. They never expected the loud entertainment district to suddenly turn so cold. It seemed like the group nearing them was in charge of the place.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Y-you’re here already.” However, when these guys saw Yeon-woo, they began bowing earnestly. They were members of the Night Watch, which Yeon-woo had defeated some time back and turned into his hunting dogs. Yeon-woo smirked, looking at the clan leader Bister and the guys behind him, his arms still crossed. “It seems like your group has become larger.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“J-just enough to get b-by.” Bister was trying to appease Yeon-woo in case he said something weird. He was like a king in this district since he had outstanding subordinates, but Yeon-woo was still too scary to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bister had even discovered that the commotion on the twenty-third floor had something to do with Yeon-woo, and to him, Yeon-woo was little more than a terrifying monster now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yeon-woo didn’t look as though he cared about Bister’s expression and said, “Do you have what I asked for?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“W-we found the location.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bister shut his eyes, knowing there wasn’t anything else he could do. “Follow me.” As Bister led them through the district, the crowds split like the Red Sea. Yeon-woo and The siblings followed.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How do you know these people?” Edora carefully asked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Things happened.” Yeon-woo just avoided the question since it was too complicated to explain.</span></p>

He’d clearly alerted the people in the building in advance because the greeters at the door immediately whispered in his ear as soon as they arrived.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“T-the person you’re looking for is waiting on the eighth floor…”</span></p>

Since Bister had rented the entire building, Yeon-woo told his friends to wait a bit, and he took the stairs to the eighth floor. He realized that the building was a little different from the rest of the entertainment district. The staff was composed of young, handsome men with a flower-like appearance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The thick smell of drugs made the air feel heavy, and it grew denser as he climbed higher.

He only wanted to find Victoria and return. Even though the person he was supposed to meet knew he was coming, it seemed like no one was prepared, and he saw a sight that was worse than what he’d been expecting.&nbsp;</span></p>

Her robe slid open, but she didn’t seem to care, and her seductive eyes looked Yeon-woo up and down. “Hm. I don’t have a mask fetish, and I didn’t call for you. Is this on the house? Well, since you have a nice body, so I’ll accept it this one time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The woman smiled, and patted the space next to her. Although her eyes were cloudy from drugs, it added to her captivating charm. Was she using a spell for seduction? Yeon-woo felt the sudden urge to run to her, to feel her skin against his, and throw her to the floor. His annoyance turned into desire almost instantly, and he wanted to extinguish his anger with her heat.</span></p>

It made for a very alluring sight. Behind her, smoke gathered and formed a large, shadowy figure dozens of meters long. It looked like a fox with nine tails.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a Gumiho, the most powerful Legendary Beast.

For a moment, Yeon-woo didn’t recognize her. Her hair had turned white, and there were dark circles around her eyes. Her body was weaker and her voice sounded raspy. She looked worse than when they’d split up.</span></p>
