The color red had appeared after multiple tests, which meant that I was in critical condition. Someone had been poisoning me over a long period of time, so carefully that even my trait, Perfect Adaptability, hadn’t caught it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arthia was a very reclusive clan, and even after we became a Large Clan, we only accepted a few members. It was impossible to join if you hadn’t been recommended by someone I knew or accepted by the majority after a vote. This was why even though we didn’t have a lot of members, our bond and trust in each other was unshakeable. A few of us were even ready to give their lives for the clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sadi had been one of them. After we were trapped by our enemies, she had volunteered to distract them so that the rest of the clan members could escape. Kun Khr had been injured and unconscious at the time, but it was obvious how he felt after.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But an assassination attempt was almost a bit embarrassing. I was the clan’s leader and core. If the information that someone had been poisoning me for a while, distrust would break out among the clan members. Everyone was already going through a hard time because of Kun Khr’s departure. I couldn’t add fuel to the fire.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Vieira.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah.”</span></p>

If they ask, just say I’ve overworked myself these past few days.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But…!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Please. I don’t want to make people feel even more unsure. Besides, now that we know about it, we can start treatment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re so…” Vieira Dune looked at me with frustration. She seemed to have a lot to say, but then she just grinned and shook her head like nothing could be done. “Fine. You’re usually sly as a fox, but you’re as dense as a bear when it comes to things like this. But that’s why I like you.” With a laugh, she hugged me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I hugged her back, laughing as well. A bear. It might have been influenced by my desire to take after my brother in that aspect. Still, I was grateful to be alive. I was sure I would die when I fell—in fact, I felt like I&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">was</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;dead.</span></p>

We stayed like that, feeling each other’s warmth. I was happy at that moment. I didn’t realize it was poison, too.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The peace we enjoyed for a short while was broken all of a sudden.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Bad news!” Leonhardt brought more bombshells to our clan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Friend, what is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kun Khr, that crazy bastard…” Leonhardt couldn’t speak properly because he had run all the way back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Worry suddenly flashed through me as I thought of Kun Khr’s face when he bowed in apology. I realized belatedly that he had the expression of someone who’d made a decision about something. Why hadn’t I been able to tell back then? Before Leonhardt could speak, I quickly rushed out with my companions. “Valdebich, get the Dragon Killers! Vieira, check how many chimeras we can use right now. Bahal, Leonte, check our manpower. Quick, hurry!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clan members all rushed around, likely thinking the same thing that I did. However, no one spoke about their anxiety for fear that the words would become a reality.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The only thing I could think of was that I had to rescue Kun Khr, but when we arrived at the temporary base of Blood Land, we could only stand and stare blankly.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kun Khr’s head was on a pole still dripping blood. His face still retained its expression of rage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crack.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;My heart was slowly breaking apart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Was it at that moment? The clan members didn’t say anything. We all strategized during war-room meetings and discussed our enemies, but we rarely spoke about personal matters anymore. It seemed like we mechanically fought when we needed to fight and rested when we needed to rest. Everyone was tired and done.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Valdebich and Leonhardt tried to lighten the atmosphere, but everyone just smiled bitterly. There was no happy laughter any more, and even though I wanted to lead the clan properly, the Devil Poison had entered my heart, and I struggled to do so.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was all I could do to keep my seizures under control and focus on war. I didn’t have the strength to look around me, but I wasn’t worried because I believed things would go back to normal. I didn’t realize my baseless faith was exhausting the clan members even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The tense atmosphere that often felt like we were walking on knives finally exploded thanks to Bahal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, he joined Red Dragon.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The clan members glanced at each other without saying anything; the news was that shocking. Although we hadn’t spoken to each other lately, a comrade who had walked shoulder to shoulder with us had crossed over to the enemies. No one had seen it coming, and the gloom deepened.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The changes didn’t end there. The first time was the hardest, after all. From that moment on, things began to fall like dominoes. Aether left. Blinded by money from our enemies, Horst died while trying to assassinate me in the middle of a battlefield. Bayluk left with a smile after planting poison in me. The Devil Poison, which had already settled down a bit, grew worse, and my Dragon Heart was completely destroyed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Valdebich disappeared one day without a word, and Leonte stabbed me in the heart after capturing me in a trap. Leonhardt tried to calm me down, but even he couldn’t take it and left for the Sea of Time. Other clans that had expressed goodwill to me turned their backs. Those people I helped, people who had sworn allegiance to me, people who had promised friendship—they’d called themselves my wings when I was blazing in the light, but as soon as I fell into darkness, they pretended like they didn’t know me.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I denied the truth at first. How could everyone leave? How could everyone turn their backs on me? How, how? Trust twisted into betrayal.
