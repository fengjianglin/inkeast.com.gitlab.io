 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Time Difference]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Head Bishop was one of the strongest players in the Tower, and he would be too difficult for Yeon-woo to handle with the power he currently had. He was confident that he wouldn’t lose, but he wasn’t sure he’d win, either. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He thought back to the time when the bishop had descended into Doyle’s body. He’d been very strong then, and now that he was appearing in his actual body, Yeon-woo would probably have to open Sky Wings and release all his powers to even have a shot at victory. For a moment, he contemplated revealing his full power to take care of the Head Bishop. ‘No. Not yet.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He might have considered it if they were fighting one on one, but with all the eyes watching them, he needed to hide his power as best as he could. He would open his Sky Wings when it was the right moment to take off his mask. It wasn’t time yet. ‘All else aside, if the Head Bishop also has a hidden card up his sleeve…’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">From what Yeon-woo knew, the Head Bishop could barely move at this point as his body continued to crumble after being rejected as the Heavenly Demon’s official Apostle. Yeon-woo believed that was the reason why he’d tried to take over the Heavenly Demon’s other aspect, the Monkey King, and enter Doyle to take over his body. However, the Head Bishop looked perfectly healthy now. There was no indication of his body’s imminent destruction, even when Yeon-woo observed him with his Draconic Divine Eyes.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was near perfect, which was impossible unless the Heavenly Demon had decided to acknowledge him. It meant one thing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Did he discover some method?’ While Yeon-woo was in Tartarus, the Head Bishop had found a solution. Yeon-woo didn’t know what it was, but if the Head Bishop had regained his strength, Yeon-woo couldn’t afford to take him lightly. Of the Nine Kings, the bishop was the only one strong enough to be compared to the Martial King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, since he had appeared, Yeon-woo couldn’t just walk past him either. Just as he was considering his next move, the Head Bishop suddenly appeared in front of him. “What are you thinking about?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo’s eyes widened as he quickly spread his Fire Wings to create a distance between them. His quick-flowing time cracked like glass.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Your reaction time is impressive, as are your instincts. Very good.” The Head Bishop chuckled lightly as he looked on the wary Yeon-woo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo’s back dripped with sweat as he retreated. ‘He followed my flow of thinking?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Time Difference allowed its user to quicken their speed of thinking to help them assess a situation. It was now Yeon-woo’s signature ability, and hardly anyone could catch up to the speed of his thinking, apart from superior divine beings like Athena and Mother Earth.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They had a different concept of time from ordinary players, and so they found it easy to interfere. However, the Head Bishop was definitely not a divine being, even though his power was greater than those of the lower divine beings from Tartarus. However, he was hardly the equal of superior divine beings. How was it possible?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Do you want to know?” The Head Bishop smiled faintly as if he knew what Yeon-woo was thinking. “I’ve temporarily left the god who abandoned me and received help from his friends. Thankfully, they listened to my pleas.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Friends? Wishes? These were mysterious words, but it was clear that the Head Bishop had contacted something powerful enough to allow him to move around like this. “I can’t tell you the details right now. But since it’s you, I don’t mind answering a few questions. I like you a lot. Will you join us?” He extended a hand towards Yeon-woo. The battlefield was still in pandemonium with the jumble of multiple forces, but time flowed around him in a tranquil manner as though it had frozen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo snorted, lifting a corner of his mouth. “You don’t like me. You’re only after the potential of the Heavenly demon.” Yeon-woo had crushed the Head Bishop’s plans and swallowed the Monkey King in his stead. That meant if Yeon-woo so desired, he could become another aspect of the Heavenly Demon. He was a vessel that the Devil Army would want more than Doyle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Oh dear. You noticed?” The Head Bishop took back his hand as though he were embarrassed and scratched his temple. Then, he smirked and clasped his hands behind his back again. “Then you must know why I’m here.” As soon as he finished speaking, the Head Bishop suddenly disappeared and reappeared in front of Yeon-woo.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Then, he spread his palm open and brought it down. However, Yeon-woo calmly thrust Vigrid up, and black Aura collided with the Head Bishop’s demonic energy and exploded. Columns of flames from Wave of Fire soared to the sky, but the Head Bishop waved his hand gently and pushed it away. At the same time, he stretched his other hand forward, his sleeves fluttering as the shadows of his hand multiplied. They approached Yeon-woo, looming over him, each one with the power to shatter mountains.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo didn’t face the shadows directly. Instead, he unfurled his Fire Wings with Blink and Wind Path and distanced himself even more.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Where do you think you’re going? I’m not done speaking.” The Head Bishop attempted to approach Yeon-woo, closing the gap between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sorry.” Yeon-woo just smirked. “I’m not the one who needs to speak to you right now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Head Bishop stopped chasing Yeon-woo and looked up to see something large falling from the sky like a meteor.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The Head Bishop quickly raised his hand and flicked the object away. Although he was strong enough to push away Yeon-woo’s wave of fire, the object, which looked like a giant ball of flesh, only jiggled as it bounced away, landing not too far from where he was standing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The ball of flesh turned out to be the greasy-faced Gluttony Emperor, who licked his lips as he looked at the Head Bishop. He shook himself lightly and began to transform.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crunch, crunch</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. His flesh grew firm and then was pulled tight as he became an emaciated man with sunken eyes. It was hard to believe he had just been the roly-poly Gluttony Emperor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Gluttony Emperor smiled with his teeth bared and shouted. “Who dares behave so rudely to my friend? What a nasty person.” With the Gluttony Emperor’s transformation, loud drum rolls echoed from the fringes.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump, thump, thump</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">. The Blood-Scented Battle Drums thundered whenever the Blood Land’s army marched in war. Past the drumbeats, the military song soared.</span></p>

Anastasia scowled. If there was someone who annoyed her as much as Yeon-woo, it was this one right here. The guy that muddled her one-and-only disciple’s head. Anastasia promised herself that she would blast him away if he acted impertinently one more time, no matter how much her disciple tried to stop her. She looked down at the patient she had just examined. Doyle lay in bed with a pale face. “What do you guys think Channels are? Antennas that can easily be attached and removed?”</span></p>

He’s already had one Channel ripped from him, and it hasn’t even healed yet, but to force another one off? This child’s soul won’t remain intact.” Anastasia snorted at the shocked Kahn and Victoria. “Furthermore, the beings connected to this child seem to be high and mighty fellas. Beats me how he found them. Others would kill to have a Channel with just one of them. Tsk.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">First, it had been the Heavenly Demon, and now, it was Mother Earth.

It was the reason why she had used “fellas” despite knowing that many gods and demons were looking in their direction. It was related to the past she had hidden from everyone, but she didn’t mention it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“There must be a way if we think about it together.” Kahn’s eyelashes quivered. After enduring so many rough experiences, he thought that he could finally relax, and he never imagined this would happen again.

Although he hadn’t achieved exuviation or transcendence yet, he had the qualifications. Moreover, there was that being who had borrowed Yeon-woo’s body when dealing with Allforone. It was the being that had given Yeon-woo invincible strength. They guessed that it was still inside of Yeon-woo. Wouldn’t it be possible for Yeon-woo to replace the Heavenly Demon and Mother Earth?</span></p>
