He expected Persephone to look for him, but he thought that she would just leave a message for him or descend through someone’s body. But it turned out that she had come herself. Since this was her holy territory, just like Urd had hers on the sixteenth floor, Persephone could manifest temporarily, as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bodi silently nodded. Yeon-woo followed him. Creutz attempted to follow Yeon-woo, adjusting Zulfikar on his waist, but Bodi stretched out his hand. “She would only like to meet Mr. Cain. Please wait outside. Also, this is the goddess Persephone’s territory. How about putting that violent weapon down as a sign of respect?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sorry. That didn’t occur to me.” Creutz apologized and put Zulfikar down on the floor after kissing the stone in the hilt.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bodi accepted his apology with a short nod and turned back to Yeon-woo. “Please follow me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo followed Bodi into the cottage. The interior didn’t look too different from the outside. There was a table where a piece of animal hide was being cleaned and hunting tools hung on the walls. It was hard to believe that it was a temple. The only items that seemed related to the gods were bronze braziers and Persephone’s symbol on a plaque.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">『</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I miss it.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">』</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Yeon-woo heard Rebecca, who was flying in circles around him, mutter to herself. Was she reminiscing about her life as an Apostle and hunter? Longing dripped from her voice.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s probably different from most temples you know. Even if it looks plain, please understand. I received the calling of the goddess Persephone not long ago, so I didn’t have time to tidy up.” Bodi smiled faintly, watching Yeon-woo glance around. He had a different expression on his face than when he was talking to Creutz.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m just surprised to see game being cleaned inside of a temple.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, it’s rare to see killing inside a temple unless it’s for a sacrifice. However, Goddess Persephone is the daughter of the goddess of earth and harvest, and the wife of the god of death and the Underworld. The seasons of the earth repeatedly see life and death. Even if a kill occurs in a place where she is worshipped, wouldn’t that death give life to those living? Then, the living will give birth to new life, and when enough time passes, they will become part of the dead.” Bodi rubbed the hide on the table. To him, life and death were simply part of the same cycle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo thought the impromptu philosophical message might be the main teaching of Persephone’s religion and a message she wanted him to hear. Life and death were part of a cycle. What did this mean to Yeon-woo, who had begun to have the power of death?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Over here.” Bodi guided Yeon-woo through a door that led to the back. There was a building that looked like a small shrine in the middle of a garden of beautiful flowers. “Please enter after taking your shoes off and placing your weapons down. I’ll leave you to it.” Bodi bowed and disappeared into the cottage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now alone, Yeon-woo took off his shoes as Bodi instructed and quietly moved through the garden. The soft and squishy dirt felt nice, his sensitive Demonic Dragon Body allowing him to sense beyond it. The smell and feel of the dirt, the dampness, the squirming worms and bugs, the seeds about to sprout, the soft grass and flowers, and the nice scent of flowers. Everything in the garden was relayed to Yeon-woo through his senses, and he could feel all the life contained in it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although he only took a short time to walk through the garden, Yeon-woo understood what Persephone was trying to tell him. When he opened the door to the shrine, a fresh spring breeze greeted him.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Whoosh!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;It carried the smell of dirt and flowers and even fruits, making him feel refreshed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was another world beyond the shrine where large hills stretched out before his eyes, and flowers and grass fluttered in the wind. The sky was blue and the air was warm and fresh. It was completely set apart from the outside world. It was the true holy territory that gods used when they descended to the lower floors.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was hard to imagine that this was the territory of the lady of the Beyond. When most people thought of Hades and Persephone, they likely thought of them sitting loftily above hellfire in the darkness, looking down and judging people’s sins.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What are you staring at? Please come inside.” A lady stood on a hillock, looking up at the sky. She fixed the bonnet on her head and turned to him with a beautiful smile. Persephone’s face wasn’t as pretty as in the legends that described Hades falling in love with her at first sight, but the word “beautiful” did, indeed, describe it best.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Her easygoing smile was comforting. Gods exuded an intense, threatening aura to gain the respect and obedience of mortals, but he couldn’t feel any of that from Persephone. If he didn’t know she was a goddess, he would’ve thought she was just a normal player.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘There’s something familiar about her.’ Persephone didn’t feel like a stranger for some reason. He even felt glad to meet her, like she was an old friend he hadn’t seen in a while. Was it because the powers of the Black King dealt with death?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nice to meet you.” Yeon-woo entered the shrine and bowed with a polite but impassive attitude.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Persephone’s eyes widened as though she weren’t expecting this, and she smiled brightly again. “Yes. Nice to meet you. You’re exactly as Athena and Hermes described. Actually, I wanted to meet you too, although I didn’t know we would see each other like this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Persephone wasn’t a part of the twelve Olympians who ruled over Olympus, as Demeter’s daughter and Hades’ wife, she was also one of the higher beings. She frequently associated Athena and Hermes, who were part of the same generation. “Would you like to sit here?” Persephone waved her hand lightly in the air. Then, in the middle of the hillock, a small table, two chairs, and a tea set appeared as though they were about to have a picnic.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yeon-woo approached the table, the chair moved automatically. He hesitated, unable to sit down right away. The situation was too awkward. It was too different from all the other times he’d met gods. Urd and Poseidon were at the other extreme, and although Hermes and Athena always showed him goodwill, they never lowered themselves to his level, and they were still conscious of the distance between them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, he didn’t feel any of that from Persephone, and it felt more awkward and strange that she was acting as though they were there to talk about the weather.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Persephone laughed delicately as if she read his mind. It was a charming smile that made one’s heart beat faster. She placed a teacup in front of Yeon-woo. “You don’t have to feel awkward. Even if we’re all gods, we all have different personalities. This is just what I’m like. Immortals, mortals. Gods, humans. We’re all beings with souls. The only difference is how quickly one vanishes, and in truth, it’s not as if gods don’t die either.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a strange message. Gods and humans were the same and were equal beings. If the gods and demons who saw themselves as being so superior heard this, how would they react?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘She’s different from other gods.’ Yeon-woo began to look at Persephone in a positive light. He didn’t think she was pretending since there was no reason to. Gods and demons couldn’t lie about their actions. They always had to be true to themselves to protect the mindset and domain they ruled over.&nbsp;</span></p>

Persephone beamed and poured black tea into Yeon-woo’s cup. Then, she pushed a few plates of cookies in front of him. “These are flower cookies made from the flowers here. They’ll go well with the black tea. Please try some.”</span></p>

His soul felt like it was floating. The Philosopher’s Stone cried out happily. Yeon-woo realized what the black tea and flower cookies were made of. ‘Ambrosia.’</span></p>

Of course, Yeon-woo was only eating and drinking a diluted version of ambrosia, but Yeon-woo was still grateful. The Divine Factors were already reacting, and more holy power grew within him. “Can I take some of these flower cookies?”</span></p>

Her bright smile grew bitter. The breeze turned cold, influenced by the changes in her emotions. “He loves me, and I love him. However, we still have secrets about our private lives. He hates it more than anything if someone else touches his items. And with him gone, it’s even harder to find where it is.” He didn’t have many Apostles either, Persephone added on at the end.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo’s eyes flashed. “You don’t know where your husband is?”</span></p>

It was better described as a prison than as the Beyond. It was where the Titans and Giants were locked up, a mysterious place that gods and demons were afraid of because there was no escape form it. What happened there, and why had Hades gone missing after going there?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘The three Cyclops brothers disappeared after passing through the gates when Hades summoned them.

Something had happened in Tartarus, Hades had called the three Cyclops brothers to stop it, and they all disappeared. In the end, it meant one thing. ‘I have to go to Tartarus.’ He needed to find Hades because he desperately needed the power of the Black King.&nbsp;</span></p>

I’m bound by pledge at the Styx, so I cannot say anything related to him. I cannot even speak his name.” Persephone took a bite from a flower cookie. “However, I can tell you one thing. My mother’s generation is extremely fearful of him. But the members of the next generation, such as Hermes and Athena, want to break away from the pledge of the Styx, just as I do. I’ll help you and even support you, if you wish. In return, please help me find my husband.” Tears brimmed in her beautiful eyes. “I…don’t have the qualifications. I can’t even cross into Tartarus. However, it’s possible for you. Your fate is helping you.”</span></p>
