Kahn stood next to him with a grave face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Five minutes ago, as they were in the process of subjugating the Elohim, a portal appeared in the air and players had begun to descend. Laputa’s protective magic had activated to chase the trespassers away, but since Laputa hadn’t been completely repaired yet, its barriers were still weak. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, since the trespassers were bishops of the Devil Army, it was difficult to stop them. The face that led the trespassers were familiar to Doyle and Kahn: Black Skull, Doyle’s father, and the Devil Army’s Third Bishop.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When the Head Bishop said he needed a vessel for the Heavenly Demon, Black Skull had willingly given Doyle up. “It’s been a while, son.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Victoria watched the unwelcome reunion of father and son from behind. She moved her lips slightly and shifted her magic power so she could use it at any moment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">『</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No. Not now. Wait, Victoria..</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">』</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;However, Kahn used Open Speaking to stop her. Victoria turned to him, but Kahn shook his head gently to tell her not to get involved. Victoria was confused, but at that moment, Black &nbsp;Skull shouted at Doyle with a sad face, “You’ve forsaken the opportunity to become another personification of the great Heavenly Demon. And not only that, you’re an apostate! Do you know how much my heart broke when I heard that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black Skull knew that Doyle had cut his Channel with the Heavenly Demon and was now connected to Yeon-woo. However, Doyle only frowned, as if he considered his father’s face despicable. “Don’t make me laugh. I’ve known for a long time that any love you had for me is now gone.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black Skull looked at his prickly son with a sad face, and sighed, biting his lower lip. Kahn, who knew what had gone on between the father and son better than anyone, clenched his fist. Like Victoria, he was also ready to pull out Blood Sword, but part of him was full of complicated emotions. He thought of his father, Ivan, whom Yeon-woo was keeping in his shadow. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Let me know if you need him. I’ll pull him out whenever you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Will he…be in pain if he’s in there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Time flows differently inside, so you don’t have to be concerned. Currently, he’s in a comatose state. He won’t even recognize that he’s trapped.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Later…I’ll see him after everything.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Iron Lion Ivan and Black Skull—how much suffering had their greedy fathers caused? The traumas of their younger days sometimes returned to suffocate them. No matter how much they resolved to get rid of the feeling, it wasn’t easy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He did say he’d meet Ivan after the battle was over, but a part of him didn’t know if he could face his father and pretend nothing was wrong. He wanted to avoid the meeting forever. He couldn’t imagine how shocked Doyle was to see his father appear so unexpectedly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though Doyle was more mentally stable now that Kahn was by his side and Yeon-woo was supporting him, Kahn’s knowledge of Doyle told him that he was shaking inside despite his strong demeanor. Kahn was also aware of Doyle’s deep-seated fury.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘If something happens, we’ll attack.’ Kahn felt Yeon-woo’s energy being shaken by the Elohim and quietly began to move behind them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With the Elohim crushed, it was obvious who their next opponents would be. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha! Five minutes before hell. Nothing’s normal.” Bow God Jang Wei looked at the storm of fire in the sky and chuckled. He hadn’t ever seen a pandemonium as intense as this. The shadows were trying to swallow survivors, and transcendents that rarely appeared in the Tower were in the middle of battle.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bone Dragon spewed her cursed Breath on a bizarre manifestation, and armies of gods and demons fought to cause each other’s downfall. Jang Wei realized that he wasn’t the kind of person who could leave the battlefield, both on Earth and in the Tower. ‘There’s always a great war wherever the captain is!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he learned that Arthia moved their clan house and officially started a war with the Elohim and Devil Army alliance, Jang Wei realized that his chance had come. He was tired of hiding from the One-horned tribe, and there was no better time to reappear than in the middle of Arthia’s war.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Just as the masked Yeon-woo had fooled the Tower for a long time as the Hoarder, Jang Wei had tricked Yeon-woo as the Bow God, and it was time to reveal his identity now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of expression would Yeon-woo have? Back on Earth, he’d always been impassive, which was why he’d been given the code name “Cain”, after the first murderer in the Bible. He hadn’t seemed human at all as he planned and executed attacks with their multinational squad.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was a cold man who didn’t even cry when his girlfriend, Jang Wei’s sister, had died. Jang Wei was dying to know if that icy expression would change or if it would remain the same. He untied the Sun-Shooting Bow and gripped it with his right hand.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He released the holy power of Hou Yi, the only thing that had extended a hand to him back when he’d first entered the Tower and didn’t know anything. It began to move towards Yeon-woo’s energy covertly, so that no one would discover Jang Wei.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Die!” Bayluk screamed, his bloodied face still smashed on the ground. He was an alchemist and so rarely took part in violent battles. The pain he was enduring was shocking to him. The Crawling Chaos was about to bless him so that he could continue his legend, he couldn’t allow a mere mortal to humiliate him, especially one who was supposed to be one of his resources.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swish</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">.

Vigrid’s blade slashed at the tentacles as though it were lopping off branches. However, energy flowed from the tentacles’ skin, and the amputated areas regrew with sturdier and thicker tentacles. The severed tentacles stuck their bases in the ground and pulled up more tentacles.</span></p>

Even if you survive, I’ll make you regret it!” Bayluk thought that Yeon-woo could no longer get near him and roared as he raised himself. &nbsp;His crushed face was healing with an unbelievable regenerative ability, but there was no way to restore his broken pride. He wanted to capture Yeon-woo to make him go through a living hell. Three times as many tentacles sprouted from his body and covered the sky.</span></p>

He looked like he was being hung over an execution table. He wanted to loosen the chains, but his body didn’t have any strength.

It was as though he were experiencing every type of physical pain that ever existed. It didn’t matter how much he tried to control his senses.

Yeon-woo stretched out a hand to the magic core with a slightly grim expression.
