 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s coming.” Phante and Edora reacted right away to Yeon-woo’s words, turning around and looking up from checking their equipment. Lightning sparked around Phante, and Edora quietly drew her sword.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Lao didn’t understand what they were doing. He hadn’t felt anything at all, and his skill, Nine Snakes’ Eyes, usually sensed danger quickly. He thought that Yeon-woo had been mistaken. The Ceratopsian Dinosaur was even more powerful than the Kraken, and even though the Hoarder was strong, all players would be nervous facing the monster. There were rumors that Yeon-woo had caught the Kraken on the twenty-second floor on his own, but the Blood Land thought it was impossible. ‘And if it’s not, I can confirm the Hoarder’s skill this time.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wanted to observe everything, from Yeon-woo’s traits and skills to his properties and even the artifacts that he used. Marquis Caliburn hadn’t sent him here for nothing. So until the Ceratopsian Dinosaur arrived, he was supposed to stay by De Roy Lake.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Mm?’ Lao’s eyes widened when bubbles started appearing on the surface of the lake. ‘He was right?’ Lao couldn’t believe that Yeon-woo had managed to sense something that he hadn’t been able to, but he immediately reacted. “Everyone, to your positions! Beware of attacks from the outside!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He knew that the Elohim was aiming for Yeon-woo, and it was likely that they would attack when the dinosaur appeared while everyone was busy. The players of the Blood Land all lifted their shields and shouted out, “The shouts have stopped, and the red flag has been raised. Like the manifestation of battle…!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&lt;War Song of Victory&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was a clan skill that all players in the Blood Land could use, and it buffed players to increase their resistance to curses. However, it had an additional, lesser-known benefit. As the players sang the song, the buff increased and put everyone under a mass hypnosis. It connected their senses and minds and turned them all into the sword of whoever was in charge. They would become brave warriors without any fear of death, which was why those who fought the Blood Land did their best—often unsuccessfully—to prevent them from using this skill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As a thick magic circle wrapped around them, the unusual feeling of having thirty players in his hands swept over Lao. He was ready to act against any attacks. Suddenly, something soared up through the surface of the lake. It was a monster around eighty meters high. It looked down on them, so close that they could only see its shadow. Lao cocked his head to one side to look at the entire creature.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was four-legged, with a neck and tail larger than its body. Its skin looked tough, and it didn’t seem like even a sword would pierce through it. It announced its arrival with a loud roar.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo instantly spread his Fire Wings and flew towards the head of the creature. Phante and Edora quickly clambered onto its body and ran towards the head as well. Lao left his subordinates to guard and watched the scene with magic power focused in his eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also a good opportunity to observe the heir presumptive and princess of the One-horned tribe. However, at that moment, the Ceratopsian Dinosaur opened its mouth and swallowed Yeon-woo and the siblings down with a single gulp.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘What’s this?’ Lao’s face hardened at the unbelievable sight. He thought Yeon-woo and his friends would force themselves out, but there was no reaction. ‘They’ve been eaten?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Something strange was going on, and Lao was extremely confused.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ugh. This is disgusting.” Phante scowled at the slime all over his body. Even though he tried to remove it, the smell still lingered on him. If Yeon-woo hadn’t told him to do it, he never would’ve tried being swallowed by the monster. “I guess it’s a bit interesting. A demon’s a demon after all,” Phante muttered to himself as he looked around at the red sky, the vast horizon, and the scattered yellow leaves.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He never would have expected that he would encounter this inside the stomach of the Ceratopsian Dinosaur. At first, when Yeon-woo had told them that the plan was to get eaten, he thought that Yeon-woo was only joking. Who would intentionally get eaten during a raid? You could enter the monster’s stomach and swing your sword around, but that was stupid. The monster’s teeth would crush you and its digestive juices would eat away at you before you even got to do any of that. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yeon-woo had been serious, saying that if they slew the monster like everyone else, they would lose the most important section. Phante had wondered what it was, and Yeon-woo had answered, “Its Magic Core.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Magic Core was usually the heart or the Neidan, and Phante knew that the Ceratopsian Dinosaur’s heart would come out if you slit its throat. However, Yeon-woo had explained that it wasn’t entirely accurate. “There are five organs that function as the Ceratopsian Dinosaur’s heart. It has only one its body, and the other four are kept in its mind.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo had called it a hidden piece within a hidden piece. Since Phante trusted him anyway, he’d gone through being eaten, and it looked like Yeon-woo was right. ‘Five…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ceratopsian Dinosaurs were supposed to be in the process of turning into a demon from a Demonic species. If so, it made sense that it would have a complex consciousness. ‘Is it something like an illusory world?’ Phante grew nervous thinking of the illusory world that Brahm made. The creator of the world was king, and the penalties for intruders could be extreme.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, since this place wasn’t as complex as the one Brahm had set up, it was more like a vestige space than an illusory world. It wouldn’t be too difficult to clear it, especially since there were three of them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking that he had to stay alert, Phante slapped his cheeks lightly and looked around. A lot of time had already passed, but he was the only one there.“Where is that guy? He couldn’t have gone the wrong way with Edora?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Why are you muttering to yourself like a crazy person?” At that moment, Yeon-woo landed next to him, heat emanating around him even as his Fire Wings disappeared. Edora was right by his side, looking as though she were so happy that she could die.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re here already? Why do you look like that?” Edora frowned at Phante, who was smirking. “What’s with that nauseating face?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing. I was just thinking that you should’ve gone to the stomach instead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Edora mouthed the words ‘You want to die?’ behind Yeon-woo, her fist raised. Of course, Phante pretended like he hadn’t seen anything and looked at Yeon-woo, who was holding something the size of a human head. It looked like he’d ripped it off from somewhere.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What’s that in your hand?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“A heart.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hm? Wait, it hasn’t even been that long since we came in here.” Phante shook his head. This guy grew more outstanding the more you watched him. Phante had still been gathering his wits and it seemed like Yeon-woo had already found one of the hearts.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo threw the Magic Core on the floor as though it were rubbish.
