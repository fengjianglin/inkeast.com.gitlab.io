The only person that his brother had loved in the tower was Vieira Dune, and after she betrayed him, he never gave his heart to anyone else. However, there had been a person who’d tried to heal his brother’s heart. ‘Ananta.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Ananta had felt an unrequited love his brother for a long time. As the only Dragon Human in the Tower, she had always been lonely, and she’d been extremely happy to see someone of the same species.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">His brother had also been close to her, according to Kalatus’ wishes. However, his feelings for her were strictly platonic, and when Ananta realized that she couldn’t get his brother’s heart, she left. The last time she appeared was when his brother had been staying alone in the clan house, and they’d only talked about how they’d been faring.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it did seem as though Ananta had wanted to tell his brother something. But after all the betrayals he’d endured, his brother had been cold to Ananta, and she left without saying anything other than: “I’ll do anything I can to protect her.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Had she been talking about Sesha then? ‘Now that I think about it, Ananta seemed to be pretty badly injured, and she looked like she was being chased by something. Who could it have been?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brahm’s vestige continued to produce images in Yeon-woo’s head: Ananta leaving a newborn baby in Brahm’s arms; Brahm’s question about the child’s mother; Ananta’s shout that the child was born from her heart. When Yeon-woo reached Brahm’s thoughts, he finally understood all of his secrets as they flashed through his mind.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘It was a mistake that I’d made fooling around with a dragon simply because I was sick of a god’s responsibilities. I felt sorry for the child, but I didn’t want to acknowledge it as mine.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘I heard somewhere that the child had grown up well. I pretended that I didn’t know about her, but I still thought it was a relief.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘I heard that the child likes another Draconic species. Is it that kid Cha Jeong-woo? What a small world for her to like someone I’ve taught alchemy to.’</span></p>

I was filled with regret for all the decisions I made and cursed my choices. I wanted to see the child she left behind.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘My child brought a newborn baby to me and called me “Father” for the first time. She entrusted the baby to me, the child of Cha Jeong-woo and Vieira Dune.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Vieira Dune had hidden Cha Jeong-woo’s child from everyone, but my daughter found out about it and ran away with the baby. She raised her like her own and called her “Sesha”, meaning “remnant”. Perhaps because she’s what Cha Jeong-woo has left behind.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘I heard that my child was fighting the witches somewhere. Cha Jeong-woo was also fighting a war with the other clans. I couldn’t help any of them, not even my own child. I had to protect Sesha.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brahm’s vestiges were all dark with regret, and Yeon-woo finally understood. ‘I see. So that’s what happened.’ Brahm hadn’t helped his brother not because of indifference but because he had to protect Sesha.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was also the same reason Ananta had left his brother without saying a word. She had to protect Sesha from the witches and prevent the Walpurgisnacht from experimenting on her. Ananta had managed to save her, but she couldn’t protect Sesha from everything, and Sesha had been ill. Was Ananta still fighting a war with Walpurgisnacht somewhere in the Tower?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Despite knowing everything, Brahm had to restrain himself from helping, and in order to atone for what he’d done to Jeong-woo and Ananta, he tried his best to heal Sesha. Brahm blamed himself for everything, but there was a clear culprit: ‘Vieira Dune!’ Fire burned in Yeon-woo’s eyes as he was filled with a boiling rage.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">「</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Master, get a grip, you bastard!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">」</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He heard Shanon’s rough voice in his head.

Shanon was right. He needed to control himself. He put aside his anger at Vieira Dune and swallow down his grief for Brahm. Since he finally knew the truth, he had to focus on one thing now. Agares had appeared because he wanted to take the only thing left of his brother in the Tower. He had to stop it. ‘Even if I couldn’t protect Jeong-woo…’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At least, he had to protect Sesha, his niece. ‘I’ll save you.’ His Magic Circuit spun powerfully to grow his Fire Wings. The Demonic Factors that he had just absorbed reacted to the Demonic Studies. He arrived at Brahm and Agares’ location quickly.</span></p>

The Book of Mercury was crumbling in his hands. “No…!” He reached out as though he didn’t want to lose Agares. Divine iron snapped out again, only to clank against Agares’ barrier powerlessly.</span></p>

She wasn’t scared of being eaten by Agares but seeing Brahm call out her name as he vomited blood and Galliard struggle to lift himself up caused her chest to tighten. It made her think of the woman she considered her mother. Sesha had an abnormally good memory, and she still remembered what had happened to her as a baby.</span></p>

Sesha had been crying out of fear, but her mom saved her. “Sesha, Sesha. You look like your dad, and so you’re prettiest when you smile. So don’t cry, and smile.”</span></p>

She wished she had a father, but since she didn’t have one, she thought of someone else who was a father figure to her. As Agares began swallowing her, Sesha tightly shut her eyes. ‘Cain!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A stream of red light suddenly appeared, blazing with heat as it cut Agares’ right hand off. Sesha fell to the ground powerlessly but she was suddenly taken up in someone’s arms and hugged tightly against a warm, solid chest. Sesha lifted her head with tears in her eyes.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The face she had been hoping for had appeared.

The heat flared up, messing up his hair. He knelt so that he and Sesha were eye to eye, and he slowly took off his mask.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Sesha’s eyes started to tremble as she looked at Yeon-woo’s face. It was a face she had never seen before but there was something familiar about it—it was the same face in her mom’s bedtime stories. “Dad?” she said in a trembling voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Without a word, Yeon-woo pulled Sesha to him, promising to himself over and over that he would never lose her.</span></p>

Is it really you?” Sesha grabbed Yeon-woo’s sleeve tightly, her thin hands shaking. Sometimes, she had wondered to herself what her dad had looked like. Her mom always smiled when she spoke about him, saying that he was the most wonderful, kind, and selfless person in the world. And she had said that he laughed a lot. Sesha had always wished he was around to read stories to her, cook her tasty food, and play hide and seek and give her piggyback rides.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When Yeon-woo had first arrived, Sesha had thought her wish for a dad like the one her mom had talked about had been granted. At first, he seemed scary with the strange mask on, but he was a Dragon Human too, and he always played with her. He even made her tasty snacks and talked to her all the time, just like the dad she’d dreamed of. Before she slept, she always clasped her hands together to thank the stars.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But now, it seemed like her wish really had come true and her real dad had shown up. It was the same face her mother had described, although instead of the big smile, he had a faint one and sad eyes. Still, it had to be her dad.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Sesha buried her face in Yeon-woo’s chest and sobbed as if to ask him why he’d only appeared now after she and her mom had suffered so much&nbsp;and Brahm and Galliard had had such a hard time. But she was still so grateful that he was there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo just silently patted Sesha’s back, reassuring her not to worry and that she wouldn’t have to cry again. Then, he quietly blew in his warm magic power to put her to sleep. She was exhausted from the day’s events, and she needed to rest. “Rebecca.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">「</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Got it.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">」</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Rebecca silently appeared behind Yeon-woo and disappeared with Sesha to take her as far away from here as she could.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo silently stretched out his hand in Brahm’s direction and activated the rune magic in his bones. “Heal.

Also, he’d realized that he was only looking at someone with Cha Jeong-woo’s face, and it wasn’t Jeong-woo himself. His skills, attitude, personality, and strength were all different.

The demon was looking at Yeon-woo with a small smile, like he was amused. As Yeon-woo’s shadow stretched out, Shanon and Hanryeong also appeared, holding their swords.

These were the same words that his brother had heard. It really was a crazy obsession, especially considering that it was focused on a dead person.</span></p>

The reason was simple: to be bound to a demon meant that you would lose yourself. You would lose all your free will and become someone completely different. His brother couldn’t accept that, and neither could Yeon-woo. “And if I don’t want to?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Agares’ androgynous face twisted, and a powerful demonic energy shifted around him.

To bind someone by force, he had to touch their soul. It wasn’t something he liked to do, but since the situation had deteriorated so much, he had no other choice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The darkness wrapped around Yeon-woo and the Guai to trap them, then Agares could absorb Yeon-woo’s soul. Agares could feel the Guai jumping around inside, but it didn’t do much to him, since the darkness was a part of him. It wasn’t a skill that a player could easily fight off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But for some reason, Agares felt uneasy. He’d been watching Yeon-woo from the ninety-eighth floor for a while, and it wasn’t like him to simply give up and lose like this. Unlike Jeong-woo, Yeon-woo never lost his cool. Even in front of entities that were much stronger than him, he never backed down, and he was someone who always had a trick up his sleeve.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was how he’d prevailed during the war between Red Dragon and the Cheonghwado and how he’d managed to fuck the goddess Urd over. Wasn’t that also how he got the legacy of the Monkey King? How could such a person accept defeat so easily? It was obvious that a player couldn’t fight a demon, but it was strange that he wouldn't resist.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Suddenly, Agares straightened his back. He’d never felt this way since becoming a Grand Demon Duke—when was the last time? He realized that it was when he’d fought with the now-dead Dragon King, Lord Kalatus. He had almost been erased from the face of this world and he’d never forgotten the experience. Why was he being reminded of that right now?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He realized that a being that didn’t fall short of him was trying to appear in the sky as the transmutation circle began to float up from the ground once more. The darkness around Yeon-woo retreated from an immense force.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The red sky suddenly split, and a bright light shone on Yeon-woo. Under it, Yeon-woo slowly opened his eyes. His Draconic eyes were glowing with a golden &nbsp;light, as though they were the Fiery Golden Eyes. Then, multiple symbols and rune letters from the transmutation circle broke free, climbing up to the sky.&nbsp;</span></p>
