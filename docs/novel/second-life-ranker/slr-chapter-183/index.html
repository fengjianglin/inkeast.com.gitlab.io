The shadow fell powerlessly to the ground with his broken Sky Wings. Yeon-woo pressed down on him from above, impaling his right shoulder with Vigrid.</span></p>

It had been such an intense battle that if one of them had passed out, it wouldn’t have surprised the other.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, victory belonged to Yeon-woo for a simple reason—although the shadow was more talented and possessed more skills, Yeon-woo was more proficient in the skills that he did possess, plus he had the Neidan of the Four Legendary Beasts. Also, he’d gained a lot of advantage from the explosion, which he used to train his Mugong.</span></p>

He still needed to practice it a bit, but it was still more powerful than the Wave of Light because it was combined with other skills that Yeon-woo had. With this, he had barely won.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a close battle, and Yeon-woo couldn’t shake the feeling that his brother had given him this present so that Yeon-woo wouldn’t be embarrassed by losing to him. As the messages popped up, the arena started to settle, and his brother’s shadow began to fade away. Yeon-woo wanted to look at the disappearing shadow for as long as possible. He wouldn’t be able to see his brother again after this, even though the shadow had no idea what he was feeling.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">All of a sudden, the corner of the expressionless shadow’s lips rose. Yeon-woo’s eyes widened; he wasn’t seeing things, there really was a faint smile on his brother’s face, just like the one he’d seen five years ago. ‘It was fun, hyung.’ And with those words, the shadow disappeared with the arena.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since simulations were created from real players, it wouldn’t be too unusual for them to retain some of their memories. For some reason, Yeon-woo felt like he had just had a nice conversation with his brother—not the voice of Jeong-woo in the diary, but a Jeong-woo who was still alive. He closed his eyes, repeating his brother’s words over and over in his mind until the next section began.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>

The darkness was gone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[The fight with Hughl, 3rd place, will begin soon.

However, it wasn’t unexpected since Yeon-woo had put everything he had into it and barely even scraped by. If it weren’t for the Wave of Fire, he wouldn’t have won.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hadn’t struggled as much even when he battled the Summer Queen, and he could finally see how his brother had become a threat to the Nine Kings. Considering his brother’s abilities, he wondered what the final three opponents would be like.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they already had such skills when they reached the twenty-first floor, it was mind-boggling to think of how powerful they would be now. ‘Well, Seseung-nim is pretty amazing now.’ Yeon-woo smiled wryly as he thought of the second-place Martial King.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even he was surprised with his victory in the thirtieth section, and he could still remember how the Martial King had blown away half of the eleventh floor. Yeon-woo was a distance away from this destructive ability since he still struggled to control the Wave of Fire, and he imagined that the Martial King had already been a monster in his younger days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He wondered whether he ought to leave the arena to rest for a while but decided, ‘Let’s just do it.’ He filled his empty Magic Circuit with magic power from the outside, and awakened his Draconic Blood to quickly heal himself. ‘I have to keep going.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d managed to earn the skill Wave of Fire from fighting with his brother’s shadow, and it was the first time Yeon-woo had ever created a skill.</span></p>

Since Yeon-woo had just made the Wave of Light, it wasn’t yet fully confirmed and might disappear. Yeon-woo wanted to have it confirmed as quickly as possible. He didn’t want to lose the potential that it contained. He couldn’t put it in words, but he had a feeling that he would be able to grow this skill into something amazing.</span></p>

He could awaken the second step, and he had his Wave of Fire. He’d learned a lot from his fight with Jeong-woo’s shadow, like using the Dragon Body efficiently and controlling his powers. Jeong-woo’s Dragon Body and powers were at a higher level than his, and Yeon-woo’s eyes had been opened.</span></p>

Since he had two abilities that were difficult to acquire, he’d caused a commotion as soon as he’d taken his position. He’d defeated four bishops, including the Head Bishop at the time, Black Dusk, and took the position for himself.</span></p>

No one knew much about him. However, Yeon-woo knew that he had a Lord trait, which would help him find a way to defeat him. Also, he had the information in his brother’s diary. ‘There’s something I want to check as well.’</span></p>

After some practice, Yeon-woo managed to change its direction as he desired, and he’d seen its destructive power in action against the shadow.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He had decreased the amount of magic power he used to the smallest amount possible and managed to use up a lot less energy.

They never thought that someone who also had a piece of the Ruyi Bang would be strong enough to defeat him.</span></p>

The Martial King said he caused a lot of trouble when he was younger, and it was pretty obvious why.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo raised Vigrid into position. Before he’d left the One-horned tribe, the Martial King had asked if he thought Yeon-woo would manage to defeat his simulation. Yeon-woo retorted that he had to find a way so that he could pay the Martial King back for all the suffering he’d put Yeon-woo through.</span></p>

Yeon-woo felt the same way. He wondered how much of a genius the Martial King had been, and he felt his competitiveness being triggered. He’d defeated his brother and even the Head Bishop of the Devil Army. Since he was already here, he wanted to see it to the end. The Martial King was just someone he had to go through to get there.</span></p>
