He’d disappeared and never showed himself even when Yeon-woo had looked for him, and yet this was how. He started his letter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The letter was long, and the first section mostly asked after Yeon-woo. Kahn only shared what had happened to him towards the end.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Actually, after that day, I became very busy. I made a deal with the Devil Army.”</span></p>

A deal with the Devil Army wasn’t something to be taken lightly. ‘Victoria said that their pursuers and Kahn were gone when she woke up.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There weren’t any details about Kahn’s deal with the Devil Army. All he said was not to worry about him and that he was doing fine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Anyway, I left for the first time in a long while to meet my damned father, and I heard that you were asking around for me, so I thought I’d write to you.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard that you do deals here, too? Dang. I’m getting this done through connections, but you’re really amazing, huh?” &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo lifted his eyes to look at Atran. He didn’t say anything, but Atran shook his head as if he knew what he was going to ask. “You already know that we’re extremely discreet about our customers. However, depending on the person, some restrictions are relaxed. Sir Kahn is of the nobility, and it was fine to tell him that you had a contract with us, whereas his is a secret. In fact, we don’t even know it that well.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Unless Kahn was stupid, he would have made a direct deal with By the Table since he was trying to stay off the grid.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You probably have a lot of questions, but this is all I can say. Remember how you were hiding a lot from me in the beginning? Please see it in that way.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But I’m doing fine, so don’t worry, and deliver my greetings to Victoria. I’ll come when I’m done with things here, OK? Stay well until then.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Kahn’s letter ended on that note. Where was he, and what was he doing? What deal did he make with the Devil Army? Why couldn’t he find anything about Doyle? And what happened between the two of them? Yeon-woo sighed as he folded the letter.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He didn’t know if Kahn really was doing well or if he was just pretending to be in order to cover up the trouble he was in. ‘At least he could write to me.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">And he learned something new: ‘So Kahn is the son of the Iron Lion.’ Iron Lion Clan was the mercenary clan Yeon-woo had briefly encountered during the battle with Walpurgisnacht. He didn’t know that their leader was Kahn’s father. It wasn’t a secret but since Yeon-woo hadn’t checked Kahn’s background, he didn’t know about it. ‘If anything happens, I can look for him through Iron Lion.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He hoped that wherever Kahn was, he was doing well. At the same time, he was growing worried about Doyle and wondered how he was doing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Aaaack! Spare me! Please! Please!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehehe. I’ve always wanted to eat a centaur at least once. I heard their livers are so good…I wonder how it tastes.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Centaurs were creatures who were half-human and half-horse. They were native to the thirty-second floor, but there weren’t that many of them. Also, they were quite reclusive, and so it was difficult to meet one. However, because of their unmatched strength, whenever they did appear, they always drew attention.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Natahan was a centaur who’d left because he didn’t like the small society of his fellow centaurs, and he managed to become one of Red Dragon’s Eighty-One Oculus. There was hardly anyone in the Tower who didn’t know of the Red-Eyed Archer. When Natahan returned to his hometown, the looks in the eyes of his friends made him feel proud.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, his mother didn’t approve, and she kept telling him to quit and free himself. He would be in danger if he continued since centaurs didn’t belong on a dark battlefield but out in a large, open field.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Natahan had shouted at his mother, telling her that she didn’t know anything. Her nagging annoyed him. He was successful and progressing well, so why was his mother so worried? It was stressful and he hated it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, when he was at death’s door, all Natahan could remember were his mother’s concerned eyes. Her words about returning home echoed in his ears as he looked at the smiling Gluttony Emperor, who looked like a demon. ‘Mother, I’m sorry…!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Puk!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The Gluttony Emperor’s hand pierced into Natahn’s lower abdomen. He didn’t resist because the Gluttony Emperor’s predatory aura had made him lose all will to fight. The Gluttony Emperor pushed his face into the wound. He could see the quivering liver, and he used his canines to bite away the thick veins and swallowed everything up. It was all a delicacy to him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The sight of the Gluttony Emperor eating the centaur alive might have been disgusting, but the two dukes who protected him, Duke Tuan Tien and Duke Moglay, were expressionless as they kept their eyes on Natahan.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Blood Land had suffered huge losses when Duke Ardbad and Duke Robera died at the hands of the Spring Queen. They entered an official war with White Dragon, and the first thing the Gluttony Emperor and the two Dukes did was to hunt the previous Eight-One Oculus.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Now that Natahan, the Summer Queen’s former right-hand man, was dead, the damages to both sides were balanced. Of course, this wasn’t the end. If the Gluttony Emperor were satisfied with such trifling matters, he wouldn’t have started the war. He was going to work with Black Dragon to bring down White Dragon. He wanted only one thing: ‘To eat the Spring Queen’s heart.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Gluttony Emperor’s desire to try dragon meat hadn’t faded away. He also still nursed a small desire to eat one of the One-horned tribe after the Martial King beat him up in the past. If he ate the Spring Queen’s heart, he would be eating both a dragon and a member of the One-horned tribe. Where else would he find a fun prey like her?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Crunch, crunch!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Mmm.” The Gluttony Emperor slowly lifted his head after he finished eating. His face and clothes were covered in blood. He wiped his face with the handkerchief Duke Tuan Tien gave him and grinned. It was a smile of satisfaction from a good meal. Red energy gathered around his eyes and vanished.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Predation and Digestion were skills that the Gluttony Emperor used to build up the magic power and Factors that he consumed. It was one of the best energy drain skills, along with Bathory’s Vampiric Sword. “Usually, centaurs don’t taste good because they have a lot of fat from being raised in farms.

It was becoming difficult to tell ally from enemy. However, at the moment, the Gluttony Emperor had no plans to betray anyone. His desire to take revenge for his subordinate and to eat dragon meat had turned to obsession. If he saw an opportunity, he would take it. “Good. Tuan Tien, focus on the coming fight. It’ll be a true buffet. Understood?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, sir!” Duke Tuan Tien, the second-in-command of Blood Land, left with his mind full of the orders he would have to give out.

Why are you only telling me that now?!” The Gluttony Emperor’s face flushed. He jumped up from his seat. “What are you doing? You should be getting ready to return to the castle now! An important visitor is coming, and we need to be prepared. A feast! Prepare a feast!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll be waiting here since outsiders aren’t allowed.” After sending Yeon-woo off, Creutz set up a light barrier and began to rest. He hadn’t had a chance to do so ever since they left Tartarus. Yeon-woo immediately went to Brahm.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Is there any Dragon Blood left over?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, a bit.” Brahm looked at Yeon-woo with a surprised face. “If you’re talking about the Summer Queen’s blood, I’ve used most of it.” There were many uses for Dragon Blood since treasure with that much magic power was rare. Brahm had used it to purify Vigrid, rebuild the Outer Space, and make different magical items. “You said to use it without any hesitation and not to scrimp on important things.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was natural for Brahm to be surprised by Yeon-woo’s question. He felt like he was being interrogated, and it was an unpleasant feeling. However, Yeon-woo only looked satisfied. “That means there’s still some left.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Only a small amount.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That’s good. If you need it for something, just give me a diluted amount. Or you can pass on whatever’s left after you’re done using it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brahm realized Yeon-woo was planning something again. Interest filled his face. “Where are you planning on using it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m going to give it to the Gluttony Emperor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Brahm frowned slightly. The Gluttony Emperor had chased after Sesha, but Yeon-woo was going to give him a present? Before a misunderstanding occurred, Yeon-woo calmly explained his idea, and Brahm looked astonished. Then, he smirked.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“So, you’re going to give him the leftover blood and get Jamshid’s Liquor in return?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, that is right.”</span></p>

It’s even more expensive than Dragon Blood among fanatics.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jamshid’s Liquor wasn’t simply wine. It held the magic power of an ancient king, and its value as an elixir was outstanding.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We don’t even have much left, and you only want to give him our leftovers…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The value of an item is subjective.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I suppose.” Brahm clucked his tongue, thinking of the Gluttony Emperor’s obsession for Dragon Blood and dragon meat. “In that case, wait here a moment.” Brahm stood and left for his lab. When he came back, he tossed a tightly corked flask to Yeon-woo. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo caught it and looked at the red blood inside the flask.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I diluted it and mixed it with a bunch of other stuff. I made it taste exactly like blood so that fool will like it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Gluttony Emperor will probably enjoy it.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“And this is dragon meat. I was saving it in case of an emergency, so take as much as you want.” Brahm put a big pouch on the table.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo accepted it. “Thank you.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re all yours anyway. Also...” Brahm’s eyes flashed. “Do you think it’s true that they can find Jeong-woo’s soul?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m not sure.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You have to create Kynee as quickly as you can. Is that it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes.”</span></p>

However, he has a lot of pride and is very responsible when it comes to his duties. That’s probably why he’s still in Tartarus.” Then, his eyes narrowed. “But it’s a bit strange. He could’ve asked all of Olympus for assistance. Why…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Hades had a strong sense of responsibility, he wasn’t the kind of person who would let things deteriorate so much. Was something preventing him from asking for help?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo had thought of this as well, so he nodded in agreement. “In my home world, we have a saying that goes something like ‘One hundred people, one hundred colors’. It means that each person has their own troubles. There’s no need to interfere with what the gods are up to. I will only focus on Kynee.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I used to live under the rule of the laws of causality.

Her eyes were still empty. “Can I speak with Ananta for a moment?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’d be grateful if you did. Ananta won’t be bored then.”</span></p>

There was a blanket with a cute pattern of bears on her knees. It was Sesha’s blanket, and it seemed like she had given it to Ananta to make her more comfortable.</span></p>
