Athena, who had eyes and ears all over Olympus, had heard that Poseidon had given this order to his subordinates, and it was obvious who the player in question was: Cha Yeon-woo. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Athena had been following his exploits with great interest, and since Poseidon had commanded that he be punished, she’d looked for Hermes, filled with anger.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hermes couldn’t help laughing when he saw his sister, annoying her. She raised an eyebrow and glared at him. “What’s so funny?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Nothing. It’s just that I’ve never seen you this flustered.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Athena furrowed her eyebrows. She shut her mouth and didn’t say anything. Hermes found the entire thing hilarious. He’d met Yeon-woo a few times, but Athena had never contacted him other than the time that Yeon-woo had sacrificed Aegis. Still, she cherished Yeon-woo like her own child or her own Apostle. Since he knew why, he didn’t speak much about it, but it was still interesting to see the goddess of war who made demons tremble acting like this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">What kind of expressions would their siblings have? Or their father? Of course, he was still in a deep slumber, so he didn’t know what was going on outside. ‘Thanks to that, we can act.’ Hermes organized his thoughts and said, “Don’t be in too much of a hurry, sister. We know that child better than anyone.” The skin around Hermes’ eyes wrinkled. “He’s a child who had turned Agares into rags. He has a few sly allies inside him that are just like the boa constrictors I’ve raised. We can sit back and watch Uncle suffer. If he needs help, we can interfere then.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Must be nice to be so carefree.” Athena snorted as she left Hermes’s residence. Hermes smiled wryly as he watched his sister leave. “There’s nothing we can do, sister. We can’t do anything from here, and neither can uncle.” Hermes muttered to himself with a sigh, “Thanks to the damned system and Allforone, who deserves to suffer a horrible death or more.” He turned around and closed his eyes, locking into the consciousness of his true body. A view opened and he saw Yeon-woo on the move. Hermes suddenly grew curious how many gods and demons were using this method to observe Yeon-woo right now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope this is enough.” The Head Elder put his brush down on the inkstone. He had been looking at the book before him for such a long time that his eyes were tired. He rubbed them but the feeling of exhaustion didn’t go away. He could circulate energy around himself to relieve physical exhaustion but mental exhaustion was something totally different.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">This was all because he was writing a book on Mugong that he’d never had any intentions of writing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&lt;Blood Lightning Martial Book&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was a text of the divination that the Head Elder had learned during his younger days. Although he had spoken coldly to Phante, he was already organizing all of the information into a book for him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, it wasn’t an easy process. The Formless Strong Energy that the Head Elder used was based on concepts that he didn’t know how to begin describing. However, the challenge was partly the reason he wanted to do it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In his youth, the Head Elder had been completely absorbed by Mugong, and he had even missed the chance to get married because of his studies. He didn’t have any successors because he didn’t have time for a disciple. However, since most people wanted to leave a trace of themselves behind after death, he had been thinking of searching for a successor lately, even before Phante had whined about learning Blood Lightning.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, the Head Elder couldn’t easily give it away, so he tested Phante’s pride. Now that Phante had entered secluded training and hadn’t left yet, it meant that he had the tenacity to match his potential. The Head Elder would have to confirm after Phante escaped the Myunbyeok Building, but he had pretty much decided that Phante was a deserving candidate. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Head Elder had begun writing with a light heart, but the work didn’t go as well as he’d hoped. It was difficult to write about the concepts in his head, but contemplating them made his understanding of Blood Lightning grow even more profound. Now, all he had to worry about was how he’d give the book to Phante. ‘I’m hesitant because I can already imagine his reaction.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The entire tribe acknowledged that the person most like the young Martial King was Phante. Once he received the text, he would probably be so happy that he’d cause all kinds of commotion. The Head Elder had already suffered a lot from the Martial King, and he wondered how he could pass the book to Phante quietly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Phante will be happy when he sees this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Head Elder snapped to his senses as the voice suddenly broke his concentration. Yeon-woo stood in front of him, and the Head Elder’s eyes widened at the realization that he hadn’t even noticed his approach. “Hm? How long have you been here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I called for you several times outside. There wasn’t any answer, so I just came in. I apologize if I was rude.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine. We’re all one family. I feel like it’s been a while since I’ve seen you.” The Head Elder looked Yeon-woo up and down. After Yeon-woo had completed Galliard’s training, he almost never went outside, and none of the tribe members—not even the Martial King or the Head Elder—had gone to see him. They were used to training in seclusion or getting too busy to socialize.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, they wondered why he’d emerged so soon after his training. Yeon-woo seemed different this time—sturdier and heavier. He had once exuded a sharp aura, as though he would explode at any moment, but now he seemed calm and settled.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘It seems like he’s found his path. He’s done it so quickly! He won’t stumble even if he adds more things in the future.’ However, it also occurred to him that it would be hard for Yeon-woo to climb even higher. Still, he was proud that Yeon-woo was now at expert level and could use Strong Energy. “Why are you here? If you’re looking for the tribe leader, he’s probably in his office.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I already went to greet Seseung-nim.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Then?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Could I know where Edora is?” Edora had gone to climb the Tower and Yeon-woo had just heard that she already passed the thirtieth floor some time ago. Yeon-woo’s communication artifact was broken, and he hadn’t had a chance to fix it because he’d been too busy training.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She visited some time ago. She’s probably on the thirty-sixth floor by now.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo’s eyes flashed. “She’s making a lot of progress.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“She’s also become quite skilled. The Yang Sword is settling in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo smiled faintly. The other side of the Yang Sword was the Yin Sword, and he didn’t know when he’d be able to unlock it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“But why are you suddenly looking for Edora? I can contact her if you want.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo shook his head. “It’s fine. There’s no rush. I can meet her up there.”</span></p>

Now that he’d made a contract with By the Table, he had finished everything he needed to set up a clan. Now there was only one thing left: ‘The Summer Queen.’</span></p>

The change from the low-level ghosts that had filled the dungeon was astounding. Everything was surprising to Yeon-woo, who hadn’t paid any attention to the dungeon after leaving everything up to Boo.</span></p>

When he looked closely, he could see mages, shamans, lancers, and other undead behind the knights. There were also zombies, ghouls, banshees, and specters. It looked like Boo had brought everyone out to greet him. However, Yeon-woo felt it was a little bit too theatrical. “What’s all this?”</span></p>

It was nice that Boo was growing more independent as he became stronger, but on the other hand, it was embarrassing how much Boo overdid things sometimes. Still, it wasn’t a bad thing, and it was kind of fun being greeted like that sometimes. Yeon-woo just didn’t want him to go overboard. “How’s the project coming along?”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“We’re halfway through.”</span></p>

Yeon-woo went to the center of the dungeon with Boo. They had split Intrenian into a core surrounded by two rings. The closer Yeon-woo got to the core, the higher the level of the undead were. He occasionally saw a Demonic Beast or a Ghost Beast flying around.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dungeon was a complex maze, and one wrong turn would cause one to get lost completely. It was also filled with magic circles and defensive traps, and Yeon-woo could see how much effort Boo had placed into making it. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When he arrived at the core and exited the maze, he saw the Summer Queen’s corpse lying on top of a large magic circle. Her hide had gone from ruby-red to pitch-black from the amount of Devil King Poison they had injected to tan the corpse.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Click-clack!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The skeletal subordinates were slicing the corpse apart with sharp knives. The Summer Queen’s scales were so tough that they had to be extra-careful. Fortunately, the skeletal subordinates didn’t have any thoughts of their own and so couldn’t make any mistakes since they were only following orders.</span></p>

Brahm stood next to him, helping as much as he could. Ananta wasn’t completely healed yet even though she was improving, and so he did a few things whenever he could spare the time.</span></p>
