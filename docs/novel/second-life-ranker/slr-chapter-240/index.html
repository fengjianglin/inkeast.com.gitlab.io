She only came to a stop after knocking down a few cliffs. “Hehe.” The Martial King wiped his brow with a proud face. He looked like a farmer who had finished a good harvest.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Endless World of Night began to shake with her powerful will, and some of the players almost vomited. However, the Martial King continued to snicker. “Isn’t that what I said to you first?”&nbsp;</span></p>

If the ultimate outcome of the Head Elder’s research was Blood Mine, the Martial King’s was Eight Trigrams. Each of the energies around him was extremely condensed, and if he used Mugong with the Eight Trigrams, the energy would sweep everything away. “Let’s see which one of us will get to punch Allforone’s annoying face.”</span></p>

It was one of the Eight Writings of Divination that Yeon-woo knew, but it was a level that he’d never seen before. The Summer Queen was blasted back, leaving a crack where she landed. A large hole appeared in the center of the mountain, and it came crumbling down with a massive landslide. The Summer Queen spewed her Breath.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Swoosh!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Hellfire instantly heated up the Outer Space.&nbsp;</span></p>

He only held his hands up and twisted them to the side. A long crack in space appeared. It twisted and the Breath disappeared without causing any harm. Clouds split, and the sky opened. The sun broke into pieces. Countless sparks fell from the sky, and darkness instantly descended upon them.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Summer Queen used magic again and again. Magic circles appeared all around her, all great magic: Blizzard, Inferno Hell, Meteor Strike, Power Ward of Kill. Each of them would have an apocalyptic effect on the stage if they fell, but the Martial King just broke them apart with his bare hands. But even then, he didn’t stop.&nbsp;</span></p>

The Endless World of Night turned into a world filled with light and heat. The fight between the top players of the Nine Kings was no longer a conflict but an apocalypse. However, the Martial King and the Summer Queen continued fighting as though they were far from finished.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Martial King brought his fists in towards his body, creating a large storm around him to merge together two different Writings of Divinations. He’d theorized about this before but had never attempted it for fear of causing damage and injury. He was pleased that he could now try something he’d never dared practice in the village. Once the beast that he suppressed after becoming one of the Nine Kings was unleashed, he couldn’t control himself. Just as he was about to crush the Summer Queen’s head, a third party suddenly entered the fight.</span></p>

His exhilaration vanished like it was never there. He hated being interrupted when he was focused on something, and he felt that his annoyance wouldn’t be relieved unless he kicked the intruder away.</span></p>

I…I will!’ He felt that he wouldn’t ever be at ease until he paid Red Dragon back for reducing him into this pitiful state. He’d been humiliated by Tom, who was much younger than him, at the Kelat Auction House, and just when he thought the tablet was his, he was suddenly blocked.</span></p>

In addition to that, everyone from the Elohim who had accompanied him was dead. If he returned to the Elohim like this, he would end up just being a backroom Senate member and die pathetically like the rest of the Senate.</span></p>

He wouldn’t be able to look his ancestors in the eye when he died. No, he couldn’t allow it, and one thing gave Ione the confidence to step up: Nebro. He wasn’t related to the child, but he had given him his territory and groomed him to be his shadow. He had to sacrifice himself to let the child walk the path he’d set out and even fly free. With his death, he could pay back his debt to the Senate and restore the family’s honor.</span></p>

However, they still had some holiness left. If they willingly self-destructed, they could access it.

He muttered to himself, “What kind of crazy bastard attacks a monster like that?” He was cursing himself. He had spent all his life savings to come to this Outer Space after Red Dragon and the Summer Queen ruined the auction. At first, he had felt confident since top S-Class mercenaries like the Ice King, Twice, and Black Skull, as well as guilds like Iron Lion Clan and Moon Shadow, stood behind him. He even found unexpectedly talented people like Jang and Turn. He didn’t say it out loud, but he believed he could at least cut one arm off Red Dragon.&nbsp;</span></p>

An arm? Fuck, no. He would struggle to even take out a finger, and forget about even trying to get close to the Summer Queen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Black Skull had just been swept away by her Breath, along with some of the other rankers. He’d stepped up to boast that he would pull out one of her claws, but he didn’t even leave a corpse behind when he died. In front of the Summer Queen, even rankers were nothing.&nbsp;</span></p>

Haha. Amazing. Even though I worked so hard.” The Ice King chuckled next to Atran. He was an old geezer who had muttered to himself throughout the entire journey. Unlike the other mercenaries who had run away because of the Martial King and the Summer Queen, the Ice King, Twice, and Turn continued to live up to the contract and stay next to Atran. They repelled the debris and moved Atran to a safe location where he wouldn’t be injured. Early on, they already wanted to take the gate and leave the Outer Space, but the path was blocked by the Martial King and the Summer Queen.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Atran glanced at the Ice King. He remembered how the Ice King’s life had gone downhill after being defeated by the Martial King while the Martial King had only risen to glory after his ostentatious debut. ‘Doesn’t he feel anything?’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Most people would have felt some kind of jealousy or unhappiness, but the Ice King seemed to enjoy the fight as though he were a kid playing with a new toy. It was the same for Twice and Turn. Like the Ice King, they grinned crazily while also looking surprised and contemplative at the same time. They all had the same emotions in their eyes: passion, respect, admiration.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘They’re all crazy. These bastards are all…!’ Atran felt like his entire body was itching. They were all psychos he couldn’t understand, and he decided he needed to get a grip on himself. It was too easy to die when one was surrounded by psychos like these. They smiled at the thought of dying while enjoying a good fight, but to Atran, his life was more important than anything else. If he wanted to make a comeback, he needed to survive first.</span></p>

The One-horned tribe were fighting close to them, not knowing their place. Even as most rankers were swept away by the Breath, the Martial King was powerful enough to tear off the Summer Queen’s wings barehanded.&nbsp;</span></p>

Both their backs were exposed, not expecting that anyone would &nbsp;attack them from behind. Like beasts, they knew their strength and so they arrogantly believed that nothing could touch them, not realizing how dangerous it was to think that way. If he could plant his arrow into the large prey and cut both their necks with his knife, how great would his joy be?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘It’s like…’ He remembered a memory from his time on Earth. ‘Like the chief.’ He paused as he felt a thrill down to the ends of his fingers.</span></p>

He was so far away that he looked like a dot, but Jang Wei could still see him clearly. As soon as he let go of his bowstring, his Arrow of Light would land directly in the Martial King’s back. He licked his lips in anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, just as he was about to let go, he paused. ‘What is that?’&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thump, thump, thump.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;His heart beat faster and his breathing grew rapid. When he’d been chasing after the Martial King, his heart rate had accelerated from excitement and anticipation, but this was different. He shivered as though someone had put a cold hand on his back, feeling a growing anxiety. He hadn’t felt this emotion ever since he stepped foot in the Tower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">On Earth, Jang Wei had the ability to sense danger, which was how he’d managed to survive the hell of Africa.
