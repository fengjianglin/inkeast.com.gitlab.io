His strengthened senses picked up a huge amount of information, and he could see that the Ninety-Second Squad was attempting to harm Yeon-woo. However, Yeon-woo didn’t retaliate. It didn’t matter what they did since they were all in the palm of his hand anyway. Once the Cannibal Monster King appeared, they wouldn’t be able to do anything, including get out of the island safely.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shanon shrugged the thoughts away. He was more interested in the skills of the greatly anticipated Cannibal Monster King anyway.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t see Charon anywhere.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit. He’s always around, so where is he now?” Orant scratched the back of his head in annoyance. He felt like he was going to lose it because Charon hadn’t shown himself on the island for several hours now. They had already gathered all the materials they needed, so all that was left was to build the boat. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">According to his subordinates, the Hoarder was gathering supplies for his own boat at a rapid pace, and they had to find Charon before the Hoarder showed up so they could slow him down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Charon was known as a money-grubbing ferryman, and they’d already calculated how much they could give him to make him listen to their orders. They’d already extorted karma from the other players in preparation. However, it was only possible to bribe someone if they were actually there, and at the moment, they had no idea what to do.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Charon usually followed people around like a lost puppy, but when they actually wanted to see him, he was nowhere to be found. Orant was impatient to finish things cleanly. With Hector dead, Ibrahimovic would become the captain, and Orant wanted to become the co-captain.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ve heard that Charon enjoys fishing in the lake across from the island. Do you think he might be there?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fishing?” Orant cocked his head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes. My subordinate just heard about it from some player, who said he saw Charon heading there all the time.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Dammit! You should tell me things like this in advance! We almost wasted time because of you!” Orant kicked his subordinate in the shins, furious. His subordinate pitched forward but didn’t say anything. It was better to stay quiet until Orant’s anger was quelled. Orant calmed himself. “So? Where’s this lake?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I heard you have to go inside the forest.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s not the Cannibal Monster Humans’ territory, is it?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I think…it is.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Shit. You want me to go in there again?” Orant ground his teeth. It wasn’t that hard to collect materials on the island, but the Cannibal Monster Humans were a big nuisance who were too tenacious to avoid.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The headquarters had said that the easiest way to clear the twenty-seventh floor was to gather materials without being noticed by the chief. As long as they kept up the pace, they would be able to breeze through the twenty-seventh floor instead of suffering like they did in the twenty-sixth floor. And after that: ‘They said the Regiment would take care of everything.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Fantasy Regiment couldn’t help them because they were randomly placed on islands, but past the River of Souls, things were different on the twenty-eighth floor. The Fantasy Regiment could interfere as much as they wanted. The Fantasy Regiment was known for keeping their clans on equal footing, and the clans on the higher floors were in charge of helping the clans on the lower floors. Obviously, the River of Souls was large enough to accommodate several boats at one time, and knowing this, Ibrahimovic believed that they could surround the Hoarder.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thinking of returning to the forest that bristled with Cannibal Monster Humans made Orant balk, but he had no other choice. He gritted his teeth and nodded at his subordinate, who had got to his feet once more. “Shit. Oh well. Gather a team to enter the forest. And just in case, ask other clans to join in.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The expression of his subordinate grew brighter. “Yes, sir!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although it was phrased as a request for cooperation, in reality, it was like a command. The players from the other clans were annoyed and filled with reluctance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Again…!” Heidi, the leader of Team Trinity, ground her teeth. Elves were known for their mastery over their emotions, but the anger on her face was clear to see. Dylan and Jun, who had been her companions ever since the Tutorial, didn’t look too happy either.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“They’re basically telling us to walk into our own graves.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Fuck. Should we just fight them?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The orders that they’d continually gotten made them feel miserable. There were many different groups on the island, but the Ninety-Second Squad had taken control of them in the name of the Fantasy Regiment.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since they had over 200 members on the island, they could bully the other clans and force the other players to help them whenever they needed it, often sending them to enter the territory of the Cannibal Monster Humans in their place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The smaller clans sustained a lot of damage, and a few teams had even been completely wiped out. Now that they’d finished gathering the materials, they thought it was over, but the new orders to enter the territory of the Cannibal Monster Humans left them frustrated all over again.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heidi was thinking of getting the other clans together to organize a rebellion. Since they only had to find Charon, the search would take too long, but afterwards, it was clear what would happen to them: they’d be forced to row the boats and navigate for the Ninety-Second Squad. They needed to get out of this.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since she was an Elf, it was hard for Heidi to choose violence, but the suffering she’d endured ever since she entered the Tower had changed her personality. Dylan and Jun looked tempted, too. Since they would suffer anyway, perhaps it would be best just to go on the attack first.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Maybe we can ask the Hoarder!” Heidi suddenly remembered the masked person she had seen from far away. The Hoarder wouldn’t remember meeting her, but she remembered him clearly. If she pleaded with him, he might give them a little help.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, her team members shook their heads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It’s fine, ma’am.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You don’t have to overwork yourself on our behalf.”</span></p>

They were a small team with less than ten members, and each person was like a family member to her now, like Dylan and Jun.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">During the war between Red Dragon and the Cheonghwado on the eleventh floor, Heidi and the others had joined as mercenaries to earn money. They’d been assigned to the mercenary legion under the Hoarder, and her current team members were the players she’d met during that time. The war ended faster than she expected, and their leader had disappeared.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were worried the legion would separate without even accomplishing anything, and she had ended up creating a team of people with the same goals that she did. Heidi naturally became the leader since she was already the head of her little group. However, she’d rejected the role at first, saying that it wasn’t something she sought, but in the end, she accepted it and led the team well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the reason why the team members had rejoined after the difficult trial on the twenty-sixth floor. Heidi felt a great responsibility to everyone, which was why she was entertaining thoughts of rebellion. She couldn’t allow her team members to suffer any longer, and she’d already lost three.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the team members shook their heads as they read Heidi’s mind. Any rebellion would be doomed, and they decided it was better to bear it for a bit longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heidi sighed. Her team members had a point. Even if they defeated the Ninety-Second Squad somehow, how would they deal with the Fantasy Regiment? They were between a rock and a hard place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How about contacting the Hoarder?” Dylan raised his hand, but Jun shook his head.&nbsp;</span></p>

You’ve seen him. He only focuses on what he can get, and he doesn’t care about others. It would already be a relief if he didn’t hand us over to the Ninety-Second Squad.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“D-do you really think he’d do that?” Dylan thought the Hoarder would be easier on them since they’d served under him before, but now he wasn’t sure. &nbsp;</span></p>

We can’t be scolded for being late.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They nodded with pale faces.</span></p>

She approached her team.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Orant clucked his tongue as he watched her. “Ha.

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Orant’s goal was to see Heidi’s cold face change, and the thought of humiliating her in front of her comrades made him smile. He was confident that it would happen soon as the team, composed of thirty members, began to move into the forest.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The forest was humid and heavy as usual, but there was something new: a shivering chill permeated it. Although Orant was safely ensconced in the middle of the team, the deeper they went into the forest, the bigger his frown grew. “Hey, pathfinder. Is this the right way?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Pardon? Yes! I-it’s correct.”</span></p>

Why have things changed in the span of a day?” Orant had a trait that could sense change, so he immediately noticed the difference in the air, and there was a smell that seemed to be tinged with blood. ‘I didn’t hear about a battle taking place here?’ Orant paused. It was best not to move when something was off.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Everyone grew nervous when they realized that something was wrong. However, Orant nodded at his subordinate, ordering a few members to walk ahead to investigate. “You! You! You! Go check to see what’s up ahead.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The players turned pale. It was almost guaranteed that they would die, but if they didn’t go, the Ninety-Second Squad would put them to the sword anyway. They went into the forest and didn’t return.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Orant and everyone else grew nervous as they all thought the same thing: something was in there.&nbsp;</span></p>

He still wanted to make her bend to him, but his life was more important. Heidi was skilled enough that she’d be able to discover what was going on. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Heidi had already experienced this before, so she took Dylan, Jun, and a few more members with her. Her sharp senses also told her that the air was different. Not long after, they found three corpses—the players who had gone before them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Urgh!”</span></p>

Dylan looked at Heidi with a hard expression.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Wait.” Heidi stopped him, the expression on her face complex. She padded to the nearest corpse as quietly as a cat. ‘Something’s not right.’ The Cannibal Monster Humans didn’t leave corpses like this and preferred to keep them intact. The heads of the players had been partially crushed and their bodies chewed up to the point of being unrecognizable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘It’s like something played with them, as though they were toys…’ And yet despite the violence, none of them had sensed anything. What had happened? Why had the Cannibal Monster Humans changed so much?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Keek! Keek!” The hunting cries of the Cannibal Monster Humans rang out. It was one of the ways they made their prey nervous, but Heidi could sense something more from them: anxiety and excitement. They were high from something and had lost all reason.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Everyone, get into formation!” Heidi shouted when she sensed the Cannibal Monster Humans moving.</span></p>

The trees shook as though they would break, and they all held their breaths as they waited for the ruckus to stop.
