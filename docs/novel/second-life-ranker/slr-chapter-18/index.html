 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeon-woo’s body was experiencing extreme changes. Mana stimulated every corner of his body, making his internal balance collapse while restoring it at the same time.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Crunch! Crackle!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal"><br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A long time passed.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Flame Heart and Frost Crest has been completed. You have acquired a new body, Reinforced Physique.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Affinity towards fire element has increased by 30.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Affinity towards water element has increased by 30.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">As always, mana scattered throughout his entire body, leaving only traces behind. Contrary to his expectations, it seemed like it would take a little longer to get accustomed to mana. But everything else had been successfully achieved.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">"Whew." Yeon-woo exhaled. All of his accumulated fatigue seemed to vanish, making him feel energetic once again. “Status window.”<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Player: Yeon-woo Cha]<br>[Traits: Cold-blooded, Reinforced Physique]<br>[Strength: 81] &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Dexterity: 83] &nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Health: 89] &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Magic Power: 21]<br>[Skills: Draconic Eyes (5.2%), Sense Strengthening (25.9%), Precognition (0%), Physical Resistance (10.2%), Combat Will (7.1%), Bathory’s Vampiric Sword (3.2%)]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">Yeon-woo was very pleased with his improved statistics. Thanks to the energy of the monsters he had drained using Bathory’s Vampiric Sword, his percentages had steeply risen. But what pleased Yeon-woo the most was his new trait, Reinforced Physique.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Trait: Reinforced Physique]<br>[Description: Heart of flame and flesh of frost. The fire and frost element fused together grants great immunity and resistance. Fatigue does not build up easily.]<br></span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[* Flame Heart</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">A heart embracing fire energy.

Increases resistance to physical impact and curses.]</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Reinforced Physique has toughened up the body and made it tireless.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">His self-healing ability reduced the risk of suffering a serious injury during critical situations. However, there was another reason why Yeon-woo needed this trait.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Body improvement has been confirmed. The vessel is strong enough. The interrupted succession process will resume. 6%...7%...12%...]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Current progress: 21.3%]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">[Your current status has changed from 'Incomplete Dragon Body' to 'Immature Dragon Body'.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal">'I made it.' Yeon-woo clenched his fists. There were a couple of reasons why he needed this strengthened body: to gain an upper hand in the strenuous competitions of the Tower and to resume the succession process of the Dragon Body.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The succession process required a strong vessel, which in turn relied on a Reinforced Physique. 'But this is just the beginning. I have to keep refining my vessel.’ However, the foundation was already in place so he only needed to advance steadily as he already planned.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As he enjoyed the feeling of his changed body, Yeon-woo recalled the pending system message that he had received when he first entered the dungeon. It was now time to claim his rewards.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[You have acquired 1,500 karma.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[You have made an achievement that is not easily accomplished. Additional karma will be provided.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[You have acquired 500 additional karma.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Additional rewards will be provided. Please select your reward.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Rewards List<br>* Artifacts</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400">1. Blood-Magic Blade<br>2. Pearl Saber of the Deep</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400">3. The Brave<br>···<br>* Skills<br>1. Kanusha's Unbreakable Spirit</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400">2. Swift Strike<br>3. Snake Eyes]<br>···<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeon-woo grinned as he scanned through the list of rewards. It was the first time that he’d been given the chance to select his reward, and he saw some great items that he had previously seen in the mysterious merchant’s catalog. It was a bit disappointing that he could only choose one item, but Yeon-woo didn’t concern himself with it too much. He scrolled down to the bottom of the&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">list</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;and found what he wanted.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[98. 2000 additional karma]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He had gotten everything possible from Section B, from Bathory’s Vampiric Sword to Reinforced Physique, and he assumed that there would be more rewards from this point onwards, so nothing else in the list grabbed his attention.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">What Yeon-woo lacked the most right now were karma points. Of course, even when adding them, he would still need much more karma to achieve the top score. Yeon-woo tapped on reward number 98 right away.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[2000 additional karma has been selected as your reward.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[You have acquired 2,000 karma.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Additional messages popped up after he received his reward.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Your ranking in the Tutorial has been updated.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Do you want to register your name on the ranking list?]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“I've finally reached the ranking list.” The Tutorial provided real-time rankings of the top 300 players. There were often big announcements whenever a significant change occurred within the rankings in order to encourage the players. Although he’d made it to the top 300, Yeon-woo didn’t want to put his name on the list. It was enough to know that he’d made it, and there was no advantage in registering. It would only provoke hostility from other top rankers. He shook his head. “Deny.”<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Registration denied. You will be shown as “Unknown” in the ranking. You can change this setting at any time.]<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">[Tutorial Ranking]<br>[1. Edora (57,111 Points)</span><br><span style="font-weight: 400">2. Phante (55,982 Points)<br>3.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Kahn</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;(50,473 Points)]<br>···<br>[281. Unknown (6,700 Points) (You)]<br>···<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">'I’m in the 281st place.' He had started late, but he was finally catching up to the top rankers. Although no one would believe that he’d managed to accumulate 6,700 karma points before passing Section B, his joy didn’t last long. <br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">'I’m glad I’m in the rankings, but why is the gap so big?' Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes as he scrolled through the list again. "Maybe the leading players are better than I expected.” He had been told that players usually gathered around 50,0000 points at the most. His brother had collected about 52,000 karma and placed second at the end of the Tutorial. However, even though there was still plenty of time left before the Tutorial ended, there were already three people with more than 50,000 karma. 'Edora, Phante,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Kahn</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Who are they?’<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">If they had joined the Tutorial at different rounds, each of them would have achieved first place easily, but now, Yeon-woo had to compete with all of them in the same round. Yeon-woo closed the ranking list as he burned their names into his memory. ‘My progress still won’t do. I have to speed up by a lot.’<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">There was a gap of 50,000 karma points between him and the top rankers. Since they were also proceeding quickly, he needed to advance a lot faster. 'First things first. I have to reach Section E as soon as possible.’ The next hidden piece Yeon-woo was targeting was in Section E. It was where&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">that guy</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;he was looking for lived. There was nothing interesting in Section C and D, and he planned to pass through those sections as quickly as possible. As he organized his thoughts, Yeon-woo sheathed his dagger at his waist. Then, he started moving towards the exit.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">* * *<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm?” As he ventured down the passage to leave the dungeon, Yeon-woo narrowed his eyes and looked in the direction of the exit. He pulled his dagger out and held it tightly in his right hand. He could sense two unfamiliar figures beyond his line of vision. 'Players?'<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The sounds that monsters and players made were quite different, so he was sure that he wasn’t mistaken. 'But I've never seen any other players in here.' He was wondering whether someone else had found this place. Yeon-woo had hoped not to run into anybody as much as possible, but since there was only one exit, he moved with caution.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">What made Yeon-woo nervous were their skills. 'They might be tough.' His senses told him that they were at least as strong as he was. Even with Bathory’s Vampiric Sword and Reinforced Physique, he wasn’t sure that he’d win over them. 'Maybe they are after me.' Yeon-woo clasped his dagger.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">He wondered why experts like them were still in Section B. It wasn’t likely that they had blindly stumbled upon the dungeon, and it made more sense to him that they were looking for revenge. It was possible that they were players from Arangdan hoping to avenge the players he had injured when he had helped Yul. Although he didn’t know why such powerful men would be lackeys in Arangdan, Yeon-woo couldn’t let them have their way, so he kept his presence hidden.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the two players turned the corner and showed their faces, Yeon-woo swung his dagger, aiming for the closest one’s head. It was a baby-faced boy with disheveled hair and sleepy eyes.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Swish!</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy noticed the attack, and his eyes widened. He instinctively tried to move away, but it seemed like his actions were too late.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">"Doyle!" Just then, the young man walking next to him swung his sword as he pulled the boy to his side.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Clang!</span><span style="font-weight: 400">&nbsp;Yeon-woo’s dagger was blocked midway through its arc. It seemed to bounce off, but he realized that it had snapped in half. The young man’s sword was made of a higher-quality metal. Yeon-woo realized that his ambush had failed, and he jumped far away from the two players. He took out two more daggers.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Doyle, the boy who had just been attacked, collapsed on the floor, gasping for air with a pale face.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Kahn</span><span style="font-weight: 400">, the other young man, flipped out and screamed at Yeon-woo. "What the hell are you doing?!"<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeon-woo squinted at them. "Are you from Arangdan?"<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">"What do you mean by ‘Arangdan’?"<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeon-woo realized the two had nothing to do with Arangdan. If they were here to attack, they wouldn’t be standing around talking to him. Besides, the reflexes that saved Doyle and blocked his dagger were those of an expert. Of course, it was possible that they were putting on an act to make him relax his guard, but an expert like this didn’t need to lie. "Then why were you following me?"<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kahn was a little surprised to discover that Yeon-woo had noticed what they were doing, but he frowned right away. “That doesn’t mean you should attack people without asking why.”<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if you were being stalked by a stranger with unknown intentions? Wouldn’t you assume that they were up to no good, too?"<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">What he said made perfect sense, and Kahn was struck dumb by his reasoning. ‘The fuck? Why is he so good at speaking?’ He had believed that Yeon-woo would be the terse and silent type because of his eerie white mask. But he couldn’t just chicken out.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, Doyle got over his shock and stood up. Even though he had been caught off guard, he had also sustained a shock at Yeon-woo’s savage eyes, whose ferocity was even more intense than in the waiting room. For a second, Kahn glared at Yeon-woo, but soon he sighed. Even though they were the ones who had been ambushed, they were responsible for the problem in the first place. He owed Yeon-woo an apology for that. Plus, he couldn’t make a bad impression of himself when he was here to recruit him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: 400">Thud!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Kahn stuck his sword into the ground and said, "I'm sorry. I didn’t think it through." Doyle also bowed his head.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeon-woo's eyes glittered. He thought players in general were self-centered and narcissistic, not to mention full of pride. Most of them wouldn’t admit any errors even if they were caught red-handed, but these two were innocently conceding their mistakes. Yeon-woo realized they didn't have any bad intentions, and he relaxed. As he put his daggers back, he said, "OK. State your business."<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Kahn smiled mischievously and shouted with great confidence, “You should join my crew!" It was a short declaration without any reasoning or logic. Doyle turned his head away in shame.<br></span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left"><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeon-woo wrinkled his brow. ‘Who the hell is this moron?’</span></p>
