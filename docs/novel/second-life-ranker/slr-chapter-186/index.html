It was better to compile rewards and get them in one go at a later time. Just as he was about to activate the portal, his communication ring suddenly rang. It was the Night Watch from the Outer District of the Tower. ‘I wonder what’s going on?’</span></p>

He had been too complacent because he thought Brahm would stay on the twenty-third floor for a while. The portal opened, and Yeon-woo was swallowed up by light.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>

The records in the Hall of Fame hadn’t changed in a while, and even the Martial King hadn’t been able to take first place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Even though it was a tie, it still meant that Yeon-woo had achieved the same score as Allforone. Because of this, the Hoarder began to gain fame among the high rankers and large clans. Some of them began to wonder why he’d never revealed his name ever since he started the Tutorial. Although most people didn’t give it too much thought, the question of the Hoarder’s identity became a matter of interest to some. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[A new record has been set in the 21st floor’s Hall of Fame. Would you like to check?]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo had gone to the twenty-first floor this morning, and after sending him away, Henova had set his notifications to alert him if the rankings changed. However, he didn’t think he’d hear anything for at least a few days—maybe even a few years.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He was confused when the message popped up, and worried that something had gone wrong, he quickly flicked the window open, already forgetting about the stranger who’d entered the smithy. At the top of the rankings was an unrevealed name. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Tied in first place?” Was that even possible? And not only that, it was a tie with Allforone. Henova couldn’t help smiling warmly after he got over his surprise. It had been worth making those artifacts for Yeon-woo. At the very least, Yeon-woo hadn’t let his reputation down. “Hm. He still has a brain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Henova smiled and put his hammer down. He grabbed his pipe and put it in his mouth. As he inhaled, he thought that if he were a player, he would have also gone to the twenty-first floor to see a face that he missed. Although it was only a shadow, he thought it would be nice to visit him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Since Yeon-woo had gone to the twenty-first floor armed with Henova’s artifact, it almost felt as though Henova had gone himself. He savored the thought of seeing the face that Yeon-woo had likely seen. What kind of expression did the shadow have? Was it laughing or expressionless like the other shadows? In fact, what kind of expression did that shadow’s true self have when he cleared the twenty-first floor? He’d probably been smiling like a fool. Did he use the Dragon Slayer that Henova made or lightning?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The old memories began to resurface. Before, it hurt him too much to think of them, but now it felt as though he could begin opening them again one by one. ‘Mm, wasn’t there a customer here? And I heard that someone from the One-horned tribe was coming to visit.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Henova turned to look at the door, but there wasn’t anyone there.&nbsp;</span></p>

When he had made his investigations, he’d heard that Henova’s skills had become rusty after Arthia’s fall, but he could see for himself that the rumors were false. Perhaps they’d only spread because Henova had lost his motivation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Henova seemed to have found his fire again, even though his disciple Bahal was dead. Even though they’d cut ties, a former disciple still had some significance. ‘Something’s definitely up.’ Jang Wei had been planning on messing Henova up, and he’d been prepared to even kidnap and torture him. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But before he could make a move, the door had suddenly opened to reveal a guy with a horn, likely from the One-horned tribe. He was carrying some strange contraptions. Jang Wei didn’t want to cause a commotion in front of a member of the One-horned tribe and decided to get his hands on Henova some other time. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the One-horned tribe member seemed to find him suspicious and was following Jang Wei discreetly. However, he wasn’t discreet enough, and Jang Wei spotted him. He took some turns in the alleys of the Outer District.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I don’t know why that guy from the One-horned tribe is following me.” Jang Wei looked down the dark alleyway and deliberately spoke in a loud voice. Someone silently appeared. He had a pleasant face, but it could look intimidating if he wanted. It was Yanu, one of the potential successors to the Psychic Medium.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d come all the way to the smithy because of a deal that Henova had with the One-horned tribe. “I don’t have as much power as Miss Edora, but I can sense that you’re dangerous. Who are you?” Yanu said something that Jang Wei couldn’t understand and clenched his fist. He didn’t even bother hiding his murderous intent. Although he was always smiling in front of Yeon-woo and the siblings, he was famous among the warriors for his skills. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yanu had gotten a clear impression that Jang Wei was planning to harm Henova and he wanted to know what was going on. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jang Wei clucked his tongue. Even the Summer Queen didn’t want to be involved with the One-horned tribe, much less him. Although he wouldn’t mind talking, the guy’s murderous intent was so strong that there was nothing he could do.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Besides, he wasn’t really very good at talking, and since the easier option presented himself, why not take it? In fact, the reason Jang Wei avoided the tribe was not because he was scared of them but because they could become very annoying. However, he had already stopped caring about the One-horned tribe potentially getting revenge, and so he pulled out an arrow from his back.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The silver lining was that he now had another person to interrogate. Although Yanu didn’t have anything to do with Arthia, who knew what information he could provide? Jang Wei moved towards Yanu. His Sun-Shooting Bow was ready for action.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">***</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe. This is fucked up…” Blood poured from Yanu’s mouth. He tried to get up, but he kept falling back because of the arrow in his chest.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jang Wei looked down at Yanu coldly. It hadn’t been an even match from the start. It was obvious what the results of a fight between a high ranker and a semi-ranker would be. Still, Jang Wei had been privately shocked at how difficult it had been to deal with Yanu. The One-horned tribe lived up to their reputation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“From this point forward, I want you to answer all my questions,” Jang Wei said as he pushed down the arrow in Yanu’s shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yanu smiled despite the pain. “Why should I?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’ll spare your life if you answer me.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe. You think I’ll fall for that?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I thought it was worth a try.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“That was amusing to watch.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jang Wei clucked his tongue. The guy was powerless to fight back now, but his eyes were still sharp. He recognized that expression—those who had them wouldn’t ever give in, no matter how much you tortured them. “Oh well. I’m not really fond of this method but…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hehe. What? Are you giving up?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You wish.” Jang Wei smirked and put a pair of fingers in his mouth while using his other hand to push Yanu down.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&lt;Summon – Demonic Creatures Call&gt;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Purple smoke started to creep up, and a blue snake with nine heads appeared. The Demonic Snake was one of the many monsters he had caught back when he was still a hero. “Eat.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Demonic Snake slid towards Yanu, who didn’t take his eyes off it. The snake entered through Yanu’s mouth and started to eat his brain. Images began to pop up in Jang Wei’s head.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The snake had the ability to absorb some of the memories of what it ate, and Jang Wei relied on this method to pry information out of those who were too reluctant and stubborn. Although there wasn’t any sound, he discovered many things, such as why the One-horned tribe dropped out of the war and why the Martial King’s children crossed over to Red Dragon. At the center of it all was the Hoarder, Cain.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">After Jang Wei finished seeing all the images, he thought for a while. “So he didn’t appear because he was scouted. He had a reason, it seems. He never planned on joining the Cheonghwado from the beginning but he wasn’t really on Red Dragon’s side either, hm?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jang Wei felt a strange vibe from Cain. He’d acted like he didn’t really care about participating in Red Dragon. Although he was a mercenary with the One-horned tribe, he seemed to prioritize participating in the war over anything else.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was interesting. A lot of things didn’t make sense, but they seemed important. Everything revolved around Cain, and even though Jang Wei had dismissed him at first, it seemed like he had a lot of secrets after all.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Cain.” Jang Wei mumbled the unfamiliar name several times. He didn’t like the name for some reason, but he was also intrigued. He kept wondering why Cain wanted to participate in the war. Eventually, the snake crawled out of the corpse, which it had completely sucked dry.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Jang Wei extended his arm and the snake wrapped around it like a bracelet. He began to move towards the Tower. He’d heard that Cain was heading to the twenty-third floor.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I hope something fun happens.” Jang Wei raised a corner of his lips, feeling a sense of anticipation for the first time ever since he entered the Tower.</span></p>
