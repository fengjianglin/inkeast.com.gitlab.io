 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bureau was no stranger to incidents involving players, but the uproar today was unprecedented because of the player causing trouble on the fifty-first floor: the Shadow King. Because his name was blurred out, even the Guardians called him Cain, and he had recently been marked as an SSS-ranked troublemaker by the Bureau.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">He’d lived up to his reputation and blown up the entire fifty-first floor. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hm.” For the entire meeting, Klus rubbed his temples as his headache grew. ‘This is why I made a fuss and refused to be director…damn it!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Zodiacs, the eleven high Guardians—formerly twelve—shouted at each other during their meeting as they discussed what to do with Yeon-woo. Each Zodiac was assertive, and their personalities so different that they rarely got together like this. However, the severity of the situation demanded an urgent meeting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the joy of gathering for the first time in thirty-odd years was not in evidence among them. In one corner, some growled as they gripped each other’s collars, some bastard was yawning in another corner, one was falling asleep somewhere else, and one was crying. Klus had no idea how to keep them in check.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Fuck, should I just…” Klus hesitated for a moment. It didn’t matter if the conference stretched out for an entire year. They wouldn’t be able to get anything done. Klus’ code name was Yin. He was a tiger. When he’d been a player, he crushed anything he disliked without a second thought, but now that he was older and in the director position, he was a lot more patient. But if they kept this up, even Buddha wouldn’t be able to stay calm.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">A sharp look flashed in his eyes, and he was about to tighten his grip on the table when Yvlke suddenly clapped his hands together.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clap!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The chaos stopped.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Ohyohyo. Since we’ve already expressed our opinions, how about we listen to the director’s?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The High Guardians coughed and turned their heads. No one dared to look at Yvlke in the eye.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Claude couldn’t help scoffing. Even though they were all roughnecks, they walked on eggshells around Yvlke.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yvlke understood why; he and the dragon, Diablo, had the upper hand when it came to strength. However, Yvlke also had an aura that overwhelmed those around him, as though there were an invisible barrier around him that made him unapproachable. He could make you shrink if you stood next to him. As such, people always treated him with respect. He didn’t have friends, but he didn’t have enemies either.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">That was the reason Yvlke was the first person to serve four consecutive terms as the Bureau’s director. If he hadn’t said he wanted to rest this time, he would have easily served a fifth. He had also stayed in a High Guardian position longer than anyone else.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">No one knew how a goblin, the lowest of the lowly species, managed to climb to such a prominent position, but Klus didn’t mind, as he respected the strong and the wise. ‘The only catch is that it’s hard to tell what he’s thinking.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The High Guardians usually took care of the Bureau’s blacklisted players. Yvlke was in charge of the player at the top of the list, the Shadow King. Nevertheless, Yvlke never imposed any significant constraints on the Shadow King. This was the only exception, although he clearly had his reasons. However, since he always efficiently took care of all his assignments, there wasn’t anything to scold him about.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">In fact, Klus was grateful that Yvlke settled everyone down. He nodded, and Yvlke smiled understandingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“First, our probation of the Shadow King.”Klus slowly spoke up as the eyes of all the High Guardians shot to him. Because he input magic power in his words and didn’t allow anyone else to act up anymore, he could feel the atmosphere tremble. “I think we should do the same thing we did to the Martial King a long time ago; does anyone have any objections?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>

Handcuffs were clasped tight around his wrists. They all watched Yeon-woo carefully in case he suddenly tried to attack them, but Yeon-woo didn’t have any interest in them at all. Instead, he looked around in a relaxed manner as they walked and examined the handcuffs that were sealing his magic power away.</span></p>

What was more, he was especially satisfied with the new ultimate technique he created.</span></p>

Yeon-woo clenched his fists as soon as he saw the words. It was a skill that could never be shared or taught, so it was like his trademark.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Allforone’s Shukuchi and Thousand Li Eyes, the Martial King’s Martial Extremes, and the Summer Queen’s Blue Summer were all legendary skills. Of course, he still had a long way to go to reach their level, but it was an amazing feat in itself to have the same base. It meant the Tower’s system acknowledged him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Additionally, legendary skills could be called something else: powers and divine authorities. They were the strengths that symbolized the holiness of the transcendent gods and demons. Once Yeon-woo completed exuviation and gained transcendence, this skill would naturally become his own power and divine authority and help him establish his position.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was an incredible accomplishment. He had become that much closer to exuviation. The level of his soul had probably increased too. However, it wasn’t just the type of skill that excited him. He was now assured that this skill would work against the other transcendents he’d face in the future. If he refined it well, it would be enough to stand against Allforone as well. ‘Of course, I have to mess up Master’s face before that.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As he organized his thoughts, he stopped when the Guardian in front of him paused. “This is it.” The Guardian looked at him ferociously with a vicious air that could compare to many of the Nine Kings. Even if Yeon-woo fought with his full strength, he couldn’t guarantee a victory. ‘I heard he’s a mid-level Guardian. Amazing.’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Bureau doesn’t usually involve itself with specific events. Their purpose is to watch over each floor and trial to ensure that everything runs smoothly, and they guide the players and carry out what the system can’t manage. They’re like the spirits of the Tower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maybe that was why some players think of the Guardians as NPCs protected by the system. In my view, they’re idiots. Being blessed by the Tower and becoming a spirit of the Tower—if they thought about it just a little more deeply, they would see the implications.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Not much was known about the identities of the Guardians. Most of them used nicknames or code names. However, Jeong-woo had managed to discover most of their identities. In fact, once you became a high ranker, you frequently crossed paths with Guardians, so a lot of them caught on to who they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">High rankers who suddenly disappeared a long time ago—those who are believed dead or off the grid, or those with desperate wishes or goals but never had the ability to reach the top and died without peace. Or those who’ve become slaves bound to the system because they were filled with lingering feelings and anguish they couldn’t abandon.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They’re pitiful beings who silently watch over the following waves of players, reminded of their own past as they clean up after them. That’s what the Guardians are.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were once renowned for their brilliant abilities and talent but everything stopped there. They climbed the Tower to reach the top. But due to clashes with other rankers, lack of forces, talent limits, a shortage of skills, Allforone’s discouragement, and other walls, they were forced to put their swords down.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">But because they couldn’t let go of the goal of the Tower, they became bound to it and trapped in their pasts. They could never reveal themselves or spread their names. They were fated to remain as shadows.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The one who brought Yeon-woo here was one of them. The man who had once been known as the King of Mythical Creatures and had even been a challenging opponent for Allforone. Now, he was a nameless, mid-level Guardian.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they know, those who claimed to be his descendants would fall over from shock. However, Hanabi continued in an indifferent tone, as if he didn’t care about his situation. “You’ve been sentenced with a suspension. A new person will lead you inside, so don’t think about causing more trouble. Take this time to reflect.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hanabi pointed to a pitch-black path without a single ray of light. A cell and tasks that had to be completed waited for Yeon-woo at the end, and he would stay there until his sentence was complete. That was what being sentenced with a suspension meant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With his magic power and senses all sealed by the handcuffs, he would feel choked with frustration. The system that had been assisting him would be blocked, which would make him feel like he’d lost all his power. There was no worse punishment for players who had vigorous physical abilities.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the reason why players sentenced to a suspension had a hard time taking it after a few days and struggled to get out. However, they would only be stopped by Guardians called “bridgeheads”—skilled people like Hanabi.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo glanced at Hanabi and entered the prison without saying much. Hanabi looked surprised, as though he’d been expecting Yeon-woo to resist. However, Yeon-woo ignored him. He actually wanted to enter this prison. He’d done his best to get the Guardians’ attention only so that he could get into contact with her: the Vampiric Lord.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">She was the being who’d terrified everyone in the Tower with all her familiars, only to disappear without a trace, the true owner of Bathory’s Vampiric Sword that Yeon-woo had used well.</span></p>
