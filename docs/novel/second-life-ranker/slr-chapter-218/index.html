However, Hanryeong pounced on him in an instant with a hunting knife, its point rushing straight to his head. It was impossible to stop it. Yeon-woo quickly activated another power.&nbsp;</span></p>

However, Hanryeong quickly swung the saber that was next to him, not willing to give up his small advantage.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Bang!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Once again, tornados rushed out of his sword, breaking down the wall of souls.</span></p>

Hanryeong had been at an expert level before he died, and he’d since gained new knowledge studying the Monkey King’s legacy, and he was now almost an arhat. The only thing holding him back was his body. His skills were already there. There was no question that Yeon-woo, who was only a master, would lose to him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yeon-woo had a weapon that made up for his skills: fire. With his almost-limitless magic power and the Philosopher’s Stone, there was a terrifying strength in every attack he made.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The Magic Bayonet spewed out red flames. As the Aura mixed with Holy Fire blew Hanryeong back, Yeon-woo used Blink to follow him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hanryeong sensed Yeon-woo’s presence and quickly swung his scimitar. However, a new wall of souls stopped the scimitar in mid-attack, and the Magic Bayonet slashed Hanryeong’s side.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Flash!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;The Magic Bayonet glowed with an intense light as though it would explode.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was Wave of Fire, raging more destructively than ever and soaring tens of meters into the sky.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom! Boom! Boom!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;Hanryeong disappeared, and Shanon and Rebecca suppressed the fire and swung their swords at him. Yeon-woo used Blink once again to move.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, as soon as he reappeared, arrows flew towards him as though they had been waiting. Rebecca had read his movements.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Clink!</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;As Yeon-woo deflected the arrows, Shanon appeared again to slash down with Sword Breaker. A path of vibrant red flames shot towards Yeon-woo.</span></p>

Blink was useless right now, and there was only one thing he could do. ‘I have to meet it directly.’ When he finished, another power revealed itself.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Wicked Devil]</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The anger that had been quietly resting inside his heart suddenly rose to his head, almost turning him into a beast. Yeon-woo didn’t hold back the violence and instead used it to explode. “Roar!” Yeon-woo howled like a beast and Holy Fire expanded his body several times, burning with black flames that consumed everything ahead of him.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Shanon and Rebecca were swept away in an instant, and the hill behind the training area collapsed. The mountain shook, and everything around them turned to ruins. Inside a dense dust cloud, Yeon-woo emitted a deadly aura as black flames continued to blaze around him. He looked like a lord from hell.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The dust whirled and sparks crackled over it. It appeared as though a horde of beasts had rampaged through the surroundings. As he looked at Yeon-woo at the center of it all, Shanon slowly stood up, cursing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">「</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">I’ll be damned.</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">」</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">&nbsp;He cracked his bones. Although he was a spirit made of shadows now, he still hadn’t been able to forget his human identity, and so the same emotions still affected him. He was stressed right now, and the sword in his hand was still shaking. If he hadn’t protected himself with it, he would have been sent back into the shadow again and struggled to make another body.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shanon was impressed beyond words at his sword, which didn’t even have a single scratch. Henova had earned his reputation for a good reason. At the same time, Shanon wanted to shake his head at his ridiculous master. Just looking at Yeon-woo made him break out into a sweat, and the Wicked Devil made shivers go up and down his back.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Seeing Yeon-woo with such powers reminded him of the Eighty-One Oculus, Red Dragon’s elite. Like them, Yeon-woo had the powerful energy of a ruler wrapped around him.</span></p>

No, he decided, Yeon-woo was growing even faster than Heaven Wing ever did. Most people facing Yeon-woo would give up at this point, but Shanon’s motivation only rose. &nbsp;</span></p>

When he was still alive, he thought that he’d be thrilled at becoming a ranker and would be ready to shake up the Tower.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, after experiencing a new type of battlefield with Yeon-woo and meeting countless skilled people, Shanon’s world had been crushed and replaced with a new, larger one that had a wider sky. Seeing the vastness of that sky made Shanon consider his previous accomplishments useless. He wasn’t good enough yet. Yeon-woo, who had been at the same level as he was just a year ago, had a goal that was so lofty that Shanon just wanted to be next to him when he achieved it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Yeon-woo grew too fast, so he had to work endlessly to catch up. Thanks to that, he was able to reach the expert level after using the Seventy-Two Bian and the Monkey King’s legacy as a foundation. But Shanon believed he still had a long way to go. Yeon-woo had grown again, and he had to catch up once more.</span></p>

Not just that, Shanon wanted to defeat Yeon-woo at least once. After losing to Yeon-woo and becoming his servant, he was filled with the desire to defeat Yeon-woo at least this once. The black energy around Shanon grew clear and started to multiply. His connection with Yeon-woo strengthened, and the remnants of the Devil Cores in the Philosopher’s Stone flowed inside of him.&nbsp;</span></p>

Sword Breaker also exuded demonic energy. Was it because of the influence of the Philosopher’s Stone or Shanon’s strong will? Yeon-woo didn’t know for sure, but Shanon had grown more powerful than ever, surprising even Rebecca and Hanryeong.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Hanryeong’s pride was scratched to see Shanon rise in level while he was still a Death Knight despite having been a high ranker when he was alive. Rebecca felt the same. &nbsp;Shanon was pressing down her holiness, and even though they were allies, she almost felt as though she were in danger. Shanon was powerful enough to make the two of them tense.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, Shanon didn’t blink an eye. Ordinarily, he wouldn’t have lost this opportunity to show off a little, but he was too focused on Yeon-woo, wondering if his newfound power was enough to defeat him. &nbsp;</span></p>

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Between all the fire and the clashing blades, the four of them had fought as though they really wanted to kill each other. The training area was devastated, and the Head Elder sighed as he looked at the cracks on the burnt ground and the flattened hill.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“How is it?

 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo smiled bitterly. He’d thought he had been keeping up with training well, but it seemed like he was mistaken. However, he felt a lot better after fighting, and all his stress and worries had disappeared. “I’m regretting it.” He wasn’t satisfied with everything.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You’re regretting it?” Brahm looked at Yeon-woo like he was crazy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo nodded with a serious expression. “Yes. I know that those three won’t stop there.” Although Yeon-woo had become stronger, he hadn’t been able to catch up to Hanryeong’s swordsmanship. That was how powerful the Saber God was. He hadn’t been the second strongest in the Cheonghwado for nothing.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Rebecca had also been one of the strongest players in the Tower since Cernunnos was one of the greatest gods. It was only that she’d lost too much in her death. Shanon had already surpassed the abilities he’d had when he was still alive, but he still had to get used to his new skills.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Knowing that they would only grow stronger, Yeon-woo was filled with the thoughts of not slacking off. Brahm made a face like he was sick of Yeon-woo then grinned. He was beginning to see how Yeon-woo had become so strong. “You need to continue to push me too.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“You need to find your holiness again.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Haha, thanks for saying that. But don’t you have to overcome that first?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brahm had given up returning to the past for a while now, and he just chuckled. Yeon-woo had to get a greater holiness than the one Brahm had possessed before Brahm could even think about regaining the lost holiness.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, ever since the Tower was established, no player had received holiness. There were only rumors that Allforone had it. However, Yeon-woo looked at Brahm with calm eyes. Brahm’s eyes widened. “Y-you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo just laughed and got to his feet. “Since we’ve confirmed the function of the stone, we have to move on to the next step.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Brahm didn’t ask Yeon-woo anything else and just nodded. It would take a long time before Yeon-woo was in a position to get his holiness, and there was something else Brahm had to do right now. He had to go on a witch hunt and save his daughter.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Although Brahm only had an artificial body, it felt as though his heart were beating faster.&nbsp;</span><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: italic; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Boom.
