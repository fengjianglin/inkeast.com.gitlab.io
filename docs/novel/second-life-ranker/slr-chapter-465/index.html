Demon Beauty Castle, Illusion Knightage, Iron Throne, and Children of the Forest were known to have the greatest strength among Arthia’s affiliated organizations. They were also acknowledged for their loyalty to the Shadow King and their willingness to serve on the front lines during battle. They had grown famous as the Four Black Wings.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Yeon-woo disappeared for his personal reasons, these four forces had already begin faithfully carrying out the order to clear all remnants of the Blood Land, the Elohim, and the Devil Army and seize control of the other clans below the fiftieth floor.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Thanks to this, the lower floors and the areas outside the Tower were now firmly established as Arthia’s territory. Insurgents who refused to recognize and succumb to Arthia’s authority fled to the upper floors. The rest accepted life within the new order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Due to this development, the fifty-second floor had become the new battleground between Arthia’s forces and those who opposed them. Arthia was currently in the process of rearranging their forces to crush through this barrier, preparing to strike and rapidly advance up the floors.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">At the same time, the elite members of Arthia were concentrating on advancing up the Tower, which they had been postponing. At some point, they would have to confront and defeat White Dragon on the seventy-sixth floor. With these plans in the works, Doyle was charged with overseeing these matters on behalf of Yeon-woo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hyung, may I ask why you are so obsessed with domination? It seems like you are aiming for a system that’s even more secure than the one of the Eight Clans.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Before Yeon-woo had gone to the fifty-first floor, Doyle had been prodded by his curiosity to ask why Yeon-woo was so motivated to dominate the other clans and reconstruct a new order. At the moment, everyone only saw him as one thing: a tyrant.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Once, Yeon-woo was seen as just another elite player born with qualities valued by the Tower. However, as he advanced through the floors and escaped the clutches of death over and over, he seemed to become more vengeful. He seemed to be obsessed with swallowing the entire Tower, as though it were the compensation he was owed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It seemed like he was trying to become the next challenger to go toe to toe with Allforone, just like the Summer Queen in the past.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, from what Doyle knew of Yeon-woo, he didn’t really have a great deal of hunger for power or honor. He took revenge on those who were involved in the unjust death of his younger brother, punishing those who turned a blind eye to his brother’s plight. This was why Doyle thought Yeon-woo would feel satisfied after revitalizing the legends of Heaven Wing and Arthia. However, the plans that Yeon-woo had put into motion were very different from what Doyle expected.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Doyle.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yeah?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“It occurred to me one day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“As long as this Tower exists, the warfare will never end. Even after I complete my revenge, the biggest enemy will still remain.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Who would that…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“The Tower.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Doyle was speechless.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I plan to tear down the Tower someday. To do that, I need to gather more faith.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Doyle did not know what kind of picture Yeon-woo was drawing. He could only guess that Yeon-woo had a plan that stretched far into the future and was much wider in scope than Doyle could imagine. Yeon-woo’s followers also knew, deep down, that whatever Yeon-woo was planning would not hurt them.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Even if it is harmful, if it is the will of a god, then I, as an Apostle to a god myself, must only observe and carry out his will.’ Apostles were those who acted on behalf of their god’s will. They were the ones who led believers at the forefront so that the god’s words could be preached to the world.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Arthia would soon become Yeon-woo’s faithful congregation, and Doyle would be the liaison between them and their god. Thus, he could never have doubts or question the will of his god. For the first time in his life, Doyle had chosen for himself, so he served with all his heart.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Furthermore, this moment in time was extraordinary.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Five days from now, as soon as the restoration of the fifty-first floor is complete, we will build a basecamp there. Since it will be an outpost for conquest, each clan, including the Black Wings, must send their elites and rankers to man the basecamp. I trust that the Children of the Forest will make sure that there is no disruption in supplies,” Doyle said, conveying Yeon-woo’s orders.</span></p>

The never-ending work was tiring, but he knew that he’d grow even busier during the lead up to the actual conquest. Doyle wanted to close his eyes for just a bit. Behind him, the phantasm of the Summer Queen glanced over his shoulder before turning around and disappearing. Silence fell on Laputa.</span></p>

Sudo was the leader of the group who’d challenged Yeon-woo.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What?” Chemical asked.</span></p>

Those eyes belonged to a killer who had slaughtered hundreds of players without batting an eyelid. They were eyes that would make anyone feel a cold tingle down their spine. Anyone who defied that gaze would get struck down, their heads chopped off or else turned into a smear of red added to the Blood-Tear Stones. Sudo also felt an icy coldness running down his spine.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘However, I’m more scared of him than the captain,’ Sudo thought as he recalled Yeon-woo’s unyielding, blazing eyes. His fear of Chemical disappeared. If Chemical was a ferocious beast, Yeon-woo was more…like a ghost. A ghost that moved silently but devoured its victims completely and mercilessly. Yeon-woo possessed something intangible that affected everyone’s very core.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo reminded him of the Martial King, another elite player who’d entered the Tower several decades ago and shocked the established order.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chemical, who was the strongest amongst the prisoners in the cave, had suffered the worst beating from the Martial King. In the end, Chemical had to submit to the domination of both teacher and student. It was understandable that he would be in such a foul mood. However, as he looked into Chemical’s unpredictable eyes, Sudo hesitated to speak, even though he felt like he needed to convey the opinions of his subordinates. He gave the halfling Mary a side glance, but Mary continued whistling away as if she neither saw nor cared to acknowledge Sudo’s glance.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Damn messenger kid!’ Sudo muttered under his breath, vowing to kick her ass if he had the chance.</span></p>

Before that happens, shouldn’t we put him in his place in front of everyone?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Hmm.” Chemical’s wild madness seemed to subside for a moment. He contemplated for a while, then stated, “You do know what it means to use the Blood-Tear Stones, don’t you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Yes, I know.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“No. You don’t know,” Chemical said in a low voice.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Sir, I know,” Sudo responded confidently. He had already started speaking his mind, so his voice took on more strength. Adamantine, which could increase magic power to a monstrous extent, was made from Blood-Tear Stones, which in turn were only found in the Cave of Yaaneck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was partly the reason why many prisoners decided not to leave despite finishing their sentence. As long as one met the daily quota, one could keep any extra minerals. If they managed to collect a large amount, they would have a huge advantage upon their return to the Tower since they had enough materials to create top-level artifacts. It was for this reason that Sudo, Mary, and Chemical were told by their superiors to stake out the Cave of Yaaneck.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They were ordered to do two things: collect as many Blood-Tear Stones as possible and find the dormant Blood Essence hidden somewhere inside the cave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, even if the Central Bureau turned a blind eye to their personal collections of Blood-Tear Stones, they would never allow someone to take the Blood Essence. So, over the past few decades, the group moved secretly to add brothers one by one and search for the Blood Essence. By now, they had a good idea of its location: the heart of the cave. Due to the cave’s uncharted depths, even the Central Bureau did not know what dangers lurked there. The only thing they had left to do was to search for a way into the heart of the cave. However, a disciple of Martial King appeared all of a sudden. Was this really a coincidence?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">They did not think any information leaked about their activities, but the Central Bureau might have noticed something. Whatever the reason was, the appearance of the disciple had thrown a big wrench into their plans. The heavier surveillance from Tarneck and the other Bridgeheads meant that their movements were restricted.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Moreover, the brothers whom they’d recruited weren’t united with similar ideals but only cared about getting a share of the spoils once they found the Blood-Tear Stones and Blood Essence.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If their Chemical lost his authority, it was highly probable that their hierarchies and alliances would fall apart. Some were already extremely agitated, and in order to keep the brothers together and focus on the search one more, they had no choice but to subdue this unexpected variable as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Fortunately, there was a way using the Blood-Tear Stones. The upper management already figured out how Blood-Tear Stones could be used to circumvent the system limitation on their powers, and they could regain their skills as rankers. The cave was filled with so manyBlood-Tear Stones, that it was almost impossible not to stumble over one.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">If they went all out, the Central Bureau would definitely discover their plot. However, if they controlled their use of the Blood-Tear Stones, they would be able to avoid the Central Bureau’s surveillance. In fact, they had even tested out this several times.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Still, if they wanted to challenge Yeon-woo, they would have to take on this much risk, at the very least.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘This might even become a rebellion,’ Sudo thought.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Are you all of the same mind?” Chemical asked as he looked at the other brothers. Since he knew what Sudo knew, he understood Sudo’s intent and meaning. Everyone nodded with firm expressions. “Alright. Let me consider it. I will give you an answer within the day.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for considering our opinions.”</span></p>

Leave Mary and take the others away.” Sudo glanced at the halfling girl. Chemical always conferred with the halfling when it came to making important decisions regarding the brotherhood’s movements. Chemical probably relied on the unique competence that halflings possessed. The lesser races tended to develop traits in order to survive.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">When only Chemical and the halfling Mary remained, Chemical suddenly went down on his knees, pounding his head on the ground. Bam! Blood splattered as his forehead tore open. His sudden actions did not match the image and prestige associated with the Executioner of Hot Sands. His wild and fierce eyes softened into those of an innocent sheep. If someone who knew Chemical or if the brothers saw this scene, they would have been in turmoil.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">As if she were used to this behavior, Mary sat cross-legged on a rock nearby. She no longer looked busy and deferential to the brothers, and instead, the dignity and body language of a leader were apparent in her actions.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“I’m very sorry.”</span></p>

Things can’t go smoothly all the time. It wasn’t your mistake. Who would have guessed that the goddamn Martial King’s disciple would appear? Even upper management didn’t expect this.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Chemical commanded the movements of the Brotherhood in the Cave of Yaaneck, however, it was halfling Mary who had been tasked to monitor and evaluate them. He knew that her reputation had once reached the stars and that she was an ancient being. Chemical could not even guess her true identity. The only thing he was certain of was that if she wanted it to happen, many—if not all—of the prisoners and guards would perish in this place.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“What should I do?”</span></p>

All of the plans they had prepared became useless thanks to Martial King’s raging destruction, something that he did whenever he was bored. His attempt to relieve his boredom had led to a tremendous amount of damage, including the destruction of all the Blood Essence that they had found.</span></p>

She shook her head and continued, “It’s obvious that he’s circumvented the limitations of the Tower’s system just as my teacher has done. We won’t be able to survive by just from using the Blood-Tear Stones to increase our magic power. We need to regain the protection of the Tower’s system at all costs.”</span></p>
