 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo had been wondering why Phante and Edora hadn’t arrived yet, and now, all of a sudden, a One-horned tribe member had appeared. Yeon-woo noticed that the man was holding something that looked like a letter. 'He must be a messenger.' Perhaps the letter was for him. "Would you mind letting him through, please?" Yeon-woo said towards the sky.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phoenix wasn’t allowing any strangers to enter her territory in order to keep her children safe, but she said,&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As you wish.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">』</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">&nbsp;She ordered the beasts blocking the man’s way to stand aside and let him pass as Yeon-woo calmly watched.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo led the visitor to a pond far away from the Phoenix’s nest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Hehe. It’s so nice to meet you! My name is Yanu.” The man had lost the sharp demeanor he’d shown while confronting the beasts and now looked at Yeon-woo with a silly smile on his face.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘There’s a blade behind that smile.’ However, Yeon-woo could tell he was no pushover, and his aura indicated he was around Phante’s level. ‘But his smile doesn’t seem fake at all.’ Yeon-woo examined Yanu with his Draconic Eyes and didn’t see any hostility in him.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘But why?’ He couldn’t understand why a stranger would be so friendly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Just as Yeon-woo inspected Yanu, Yanu also examined Yeon-woo from head to toe with shimmering eyes.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Why are you staring at me like that?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Oh! I'm sorry if that bothered you. I guess I was too pleased to meet you, I didn’t realize I was being rude." Yanu scratched his cheek with a finger as if he were really sorry.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"No, I’m not bothered. I just don't understand why you seem so comfortable around me.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Hehehe, oh, that’s right. You don’t know. You’ve never heard about me, but I have heard a lot of stories about you, Cain. I was just too excited to finally meet you." His words surprised Yeon-woo. He clearly wasn’t talking about the stories about the Hoarder’s accomplishments. "About me? From who?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Oh, you have no idea how famous you are in our tribe. Oh, wait. I don’t think I’m allowed to speak about this. Hehe. Please don’t tell anyone I said this. You'll find out later anyway."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo had a strange feeling about this, but he shrugged it off, assuming that Phante and Edora must have told Yanu about him. "Is that letter you’re carrying for me?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Yup. As you probably know, this is from Phante-nim and Edora-nim.” Yanu used honorifics to refer to the siblings. “They asked me to deliver this letter safely to you and wanted to apologize for disappearing without notice. The details are inside the letter." Yanu handed the letter over. Its envelope was sealed with wax.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo removed the seal and took the letter out. However, as soon as he unfolded it, his eyes were met by lines full of characters he did not recognize. The letter hadn’t been written in the common language of the Tower but in the language of the One-horned tribe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Befuddled, Yeon-woo was about to ask Yanu to read the letter out for him, but before Yeon-woo could even open his mouth, the characters suddenly started glowing with a bright light. They broke loose from the paper and floated into the air one by one.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A voice suddenly began speaking in his head.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hi Oraboni, this is Edora. First of all, I am sorry that we had to leave without…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey! What are you doing? Eh? Is that a letter? Puhaha! Who sends letters these days when you can just—</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I know! Just shut up and get out!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jeez, look at your temper. You know, that’s not gonna help.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I said get out! Can't you see I’m writing a letter?!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">OK, I’ll go. By the way, you know our conversation has already been recorded in the letter, right?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s it!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The letter contained a mixture of Phante and Edora’s voices. Yeon-woo burst into laughter. 'Typical siblings.' The sound of the two siblings quarreling faded as though they’d moved somewhere farther, then Edora’s voice returned.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">That useless idiot! He never helps. Ahem! Anyway, Oraboni, the reason why we had to send you this letter…</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hey, can I say something too?&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">GET OUT!!!</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">The voices of the letter sounded like the thoughts the Phoenix transmitted to him using her telepathic skill. Perhaps it was a similar method.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After her final shout, Edora managed to finish her explanation, and Yeon-woo confirmed why they hadn’t shown up on the eleventh floor. Most of his theories were correct. She said that the One-horned tribe was facing an urgent situation, and since she and Phante were royalty, they had been summoned back to the tribe. However, she kept the details confidential, which Yeon-woo understood.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">No matter how close they had become, he was still an outsider to the tribe. He only felt a little sad they had parted ways without a proper farewell. 'Me, sad?' A strange feeling welled up inside Yeon-woo’s heart.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Edora said that the two of them would follow him as soon as they were done with their business, so he should continue to climb without worrying about them. &nbsp;Finally, the letter ended with:&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Take care.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo folded the letter and looked at Yanu, who was still smiling at him. "How are Phante and Edora doing?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“Oh, they are doing fine. By fine, I mean great. Especially Phante-nim. Ugh, I swear, no one can put up with his temper!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Nothing’s changed.’ Yeon-woo nodded with a chuckle. "That's good."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yanu gave Yeon-woo a strange look.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What's wrong?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I thought you’d be more curious."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"About?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Why Phante-nim and Edora-nim couldn't come here."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"And are you going to tell me if I ask?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">After a few seconds of pondering, Yanu put his silly smile back on his face and answered, "Hehe, nope.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"That's why I didn't ask. Besides, I’ll find out eventually."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yanu nodded a few times, looking satisfied with Yeon-woo’s reply. "Hmm…you know, I heard you were a strange man, and I think it’s true.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"What did you hear about me?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Hehe. I can’t tell you that either. I don’t want to die young.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘They sent a weirdo as a messenger.’ Yeon-woo thought as he clucked his tongue, then he realized that Yanu was probably thinking the same thing. ‘I guess we’re both weirdos.' Yeon-woo laughed.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">* &nbsp; * &nbsp; *</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Oh, wow! So this is what a Legendary Beast’s territory looks like," Yanu said as he explored the forest that belonged to the Phoenix. Yeon-woo thought it would be rude to send him away right after receiving the letter, so he asked the Phoenix for permission to let Yanu look around her territory, not including her nest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">And Yanu was like a dog—not in the vulgar sense, but simply that he was like an animal that eagerly sniffed every corner of a place with great curiosity. He explored every nook and cranny and even found places Yeon-woo didn’t know existed. ‘I didn’t realize her territory was this big.'</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">As expected, the Phoenix was annoyed.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Send that human away as soon as you two are done wandering around. I have never seen such an unbridled human. I am starting to worry that my children will see him and copy his behavior. I thought the members of the One-horned tribe were composed and well-behaved, why is he so different?</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo could almost imagine the Phoenix shaking her head from side to side, and so he stopped Yanu from proceeding to another location and asked, "Haven’t you passed through the eleventh floor already?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yanu chuckled as he scratched the back of his head. "I did, a very long time ago. But I never came to places like this when I was here. You probably don’t know that most players don’t get to enter the territory of a Legendary Beast. Even in our tribe, only our king and perhaps a few of the elders, have come to this place.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"I see."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"In fact, when I first found the mark saying that you would be waiting here, I almost didn’t believe it. I mean, it’s a Phoenix, you know? They are so powerful and magnificent! They’re just great!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo thought he had a point. Even rankers didn’t want to fight with Legendary Beasts, and it would take a lot of guts for ordinary players like Yanu to even enter their territory.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hmm…Perhaps the human is not as bad as I thought. Tell him he can stay for as long as he likes.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo covered his laughter with his sleeve. It seemed like a couple of compliments was all it took for the Phoenix to change her mind. After he told Yanu about the Phoenix’s invitation, Yanu became even more excited and exploration grew wilder. Yeon-woo followed behind him like a parent running after a child in an amusement park, making sure he didn’t go into the Phoenix’s nest.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As he walked after Yanu, Yeon-woo’s thoughts began to drift. He was relieved that Phante and Edora were fine. Although he hadn’t been that worried, it was still good to get confirmation. However, now he was beginning to worry about his beast egg. 'Now that I know for sure that they are dealing with something in their tribe, it’s clear that they won’t be showing up here anytime soon.’ He needed Edora’s help with the Black Bracelet and the Mythical Beast’s egg. Although he wasn’t in a hurry about the bracelet, he needed to settle the situation with the egg so that he could clear the trial. If he couldn’t get Edora’s help, he had to find another alternative as soon as possible.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘What should I do?' As Yeon-woo agonized over his problem, Yanu suddenly stopped running around and stared at him with curious eyes. Noticing his stare, Yeon-woo surfaced from his deep thoughts. "What is it?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Uhm, I just thought you looked like you needed help. Is there anything I can do to help you?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Why would you do that?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"It’s something our princess would want me to do."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">‘Princess? Oh, he’s referring to Edora.' Yeon-woo suddenly remembered Phante’s and Edora’s status in the tribe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">“She said, ‘I know he won’t be needing our help because he’s such a perfect man, but if you see him struggling with anything, try to help him, if you can.’ Didn’t she mention it in the letter?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was only then that Yeon-woo recalled the last part of the letter.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">He looks silly with his bushy hair and smiling face, but he knows a thing or two about the Tower. If you need any help, you can ask him for advice.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">He hadn’t thought much of it, but it seemed like Yanu was serious. Yeon-woo debated trusting Yanu for a short while. He would have rejected his offer immediately if he hadn’t been sent by Phante and Edora.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Wait, you don't seem to trust me. I don’t know if she mentioned this in the letter, but I’m a Psychic Medium candidate!”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">At that moment, Yeon-woo's eyes glittered. ‘He’s a Psychic Medium?' He knew about their role in the One-Horned tribe.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">The One-horned tribe’s history dates as far back as the history of the Tower itself. It has always been the strongest tribe in the Tower. Several factors have helped them keep their position, such as their innate talent for martial arts and their policy of neutrality. But the most important thing is none other than the existence of the Psychic Medium.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: italic;">A Psychic Medium is also known as a Prophet. It is a person who can communicate with the god that the One-horned tribe serves. Although not much is known about Psychic Mediums, it is said the tribe’s god gives the Psychic Medium prophecies that have helped guide the tribe throughout their entire history.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo was surprised at how easily Yanu disclosed his identity. He had heard that the One-horned tribe usually hid the identity of their Psychic Medium in order to protect them from being harmed by other clans.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">As if Yanu understood what Yeon-woo was thinking, he quickly waved his hand. "Don’t worry, Psychic Mediums are not as great as people imagine. Besides, I’m not a real Psychic Medium, but just one of the many potential successors. Besides, there’s already a confirmed successor for the next Psychic Medium. But I assure you, I’m only second to that person, so you can trust me! Yeah?" Yanu's eyes shone brightly.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Phoenix also added her opinion.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">『</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I also suggest you ask the human for his opinion. Despite their reputation, the Psychic Mediums are more like scholars that study the records allowed to them.</span><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">』</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo grew curious at the Phoenix’s description, but he decided to set that aside for now and confide his troubles to Yanu, explaining to him in detail what was going on. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yanu listened with excited eyes, which grew rounder as the Yeon-woo’s story progressed, and he even gasped out loud several times, especially when Yeon-woo said he created a second Flame of Life and when he said the egg was now about three meters tall.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">When Yeon-woo said that he was considering getting the other Legendary Beasts’ energy, Yanu’s jaw almost touched the floor. It was a long time before he shook his head and managed to pull his thoughts together. "Wow! Even though I’ve heard some stories about you, I never expected you’d be this great!"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yanu looked at Yeon-woo as though he were facing a legendary creature, then began asking questions. "Hmm, so, let me get this straight. You need Edora-nim’s Insight skill right now, is that correct?"</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Yes."</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Oh, that's an easy problem to solve." Yanu exhaled with relief and said with his usual smile, “Just return to the tribe with me. That’s the simplest option.” Yanu spoke as though it were something easy to accomplish.</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">This time, it was Yeon-woo’s turn to be surprised. "Didn't you say there is some important business going on in your tribe? Also, how can I leave this floor if I haven't cleared the trial?”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">"Yes, it’s quite important, but I think it’ll be OK, hehehe. After all, some of the elders want to see you in person. And about your second question, well, you’ll see.”</span></p>
 <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-weight: 400; text-decoration: none; font-style: normal;">Yeon-woo didn’t understand what Yanu was talking about and kept asking several questions. However, all Yanu did was repeat “You’ll see” while scratching his cheek with a finger. Although Yeon-woo didn’t understand the situation, he was sure of one thing: he was allowed to visit the One-horned tribe. ‘The One-horned tribe was one of the first participants in the Tower, right? &nbsp;They must know a lot of secrets about it.’ Yeon-woo's eyes shone brightly.</span></p>
