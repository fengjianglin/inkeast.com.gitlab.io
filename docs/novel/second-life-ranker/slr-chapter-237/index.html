As she did, a storm of magic power began to swirl and cut down all the players in front of her. Although Aether’s precious subordinates had received elite educations and were renowned for their skills, the Summer Queen brushed them aside like mayflies. It took only one second to get rid of them; any longer would be a waste of time.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">It was the same for Aether. ‘I-I have to run…!’</span></p>

However, the Summer Queen didn’t bother to chase after him. She could, but it would be pointless. She dismissed him from her mind and turned to Tom, who knelt, slamming his head to the ground. His forehead began to bleed. “I apologize!”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Summer Queen growled, flashing her fangs. “Why must I come to this lowly place myself? I never imagined you would have such a hard time!”</span></p>

However, before it ends, you should fight with the willingness to die at any moment.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Thank you for the chance, Mother!” Tom hammered his head onto the ground over and over. He could hear his skull cracking, but he didn’t have time to worry about it. If the Summer Queen was here, it meant that she was angry.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Nine Dragon Sons’ reputations came from the amount of Dragon’s Blood they received, and the Summer Queen could adjust this amount according to what she wanted. She could even take back the blood. If she did that to him, he wouldn’t be one of her soldiers anymore, and with his powers gone, he wouldn’t even be in the Eighty-One Oculus. He would instantly fall from a prince to a pauper right away.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The back of his head was hot. He could feel the mocking gazes of his brothers, who already thought that he was no longer one of their rivals. Tom didn’t even want to think about it. He had to somehow appease the Summer Queen in the short time they had.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the Summer Queen didn’t even look at Tom. Her eyes were fixed on the canyons, which sent dust clouds floating to the sky. The Philosopher’s Stone would be there. ‘No matter what. No matter what…!’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The Summer Queen gritted her teeth and activated the magic that she had been holding back. A white light burst around her, and when it faded away, there was a large dragon in her place. She looked different from when she’d appeared in the war with the Cheonghwado. Her scales had turned black, and her fiery eyes were dull. Even her wings looked ragged.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">With a broken Dragon Heart and Devil Poison inside her body, the Summer Queen was using the very last of her magic power and risking her life. If she failed, death would be the result. The Summer Queen felt a fearful urgency now that the Devil Poison had already penetrated into her marrow. As the last dragon, the last of the Draconic Species, she couldn’t die in vain in a place like this. Never!</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">“Kraaaaaa!” The Summer Queen cried at the sky. As she spread her wings, she activated all kinds of magic at the same time, and her large body trembled. Bang! She bashed her tail and took off, flying towards Brocken Castle. She was squeezing her spiritual power from her very soul in order to forcibly activate magic power. It was a dangerous process that might separate her soul from her body, but she didn’t have the leisure to worry about that.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">The powers that the Devil Poison had buried rose one by one, and Dragon Fear emanated from &nbsp;her, filling the Outer Space. At that moment, the Endless World of Night ceased being the territory of the witches and became the Summer Queen’s territory instead.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">* * *</span></p>

He wasn’t going to refuse them, but because he had connections to a few of the top five artisans, he didn’t have any particular interest in the artifacts that the Red Dragon owned.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Maybe if it was an artifact that gods or heroes used, he would be more interested, but there was no way that Red Dragon would have put anything like that in Intrenian. There were likely just a few A-class weapons or jewels inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">However, the other reward was something else. Dragon’s Blood wasn’t something that you could find anymore.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Red Dragon Species’ Blood Serum]</span><br><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Category: Elixir]</span><br><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Rank: S+]</span><br><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">[Description: The last dragon, the Summer Queen Ismenios, refined her blood to make this serum.

Everyone knew how powerful the Nine Dragon Sons were, and since they received their power from blood transfusions, this reward was something people would risk their lives for. &nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Is she trying to make a new dragon soldier?’ It was possible. The Summer Queen wanted Walpurgisnacht dealt with quickly. If someone not only annihilated them, but also brought her the secret of the Philosopher’s Stone, it was likely she wouldn’t just stop at making them into a dragon soldier.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘Unfortunately for her, the Blood Serum is in my hands now.’ Yeon-woo wondered what to do with the Blood Serum. He was tempted to drink it down right there and then. However, he already had Dragon’s Blood running through his veins, and so it wouldn’t really make much of a difference. Also, since the ancient dragon Kalatus wasn’t a Red Dragon like the Summer Queen, there was a chance that he wouldn’t even be able to absorb the blood.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">There was probably a better way to use the serum, but it was such a sudden reward that he couldn’t think of anything at the moment. ‘Or…’</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">Yeon-woo looked at Vigrid in his hand. Vigrid trembled at Yeon-woo’s gaze, as though it enjoyed it. Vigrid’s curse was on the verge of being lifted, but Yeon-woo couldn’t manage to release the last seal. The process of the curse removal had stopped at ninety percent. Holiness wouldn’t help anymore. What if he borrowed the strength of the Draconic species, who were equal to the gods?</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 1); background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap">‘I’ll have to look into it.’ Yeon-woo reminded himself to discuss it further with Brahm and opened Intrenian to store the Blood Serum. Just as he was about to turn back, his back suddenly prickled from a hair-raising aura.</span></p>

The Draconic Factors inside his cells trembled as they tried to shake off the Dragon Fear.

It was part of the reason why he tried to gain the Demonic Factors.</span></p>

What could she do with her broken Dragon Heart and the Devil Poison inside her body? Yeon-woo was still in good condition, and he hadn’t even awakened his powers or the Dragon Body yet. Boo had grown after swallowing the Philosopher’s Stone, and he could call out Shanon, Hanryeong, Rebecca, and Brahm, as well.&nbsp;</span></p>

If he used his full power, he might have a chance. Perhaps it was wishful thinking—after all, there was nothing more dangerous than an infuriated, desperate beast. Also, the Summer Queen wasn’t weak at the moment. She was exactly as strong as she had been during the war.&nbsp;</span></p>
