 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 243: Just for today</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">To a great many people, so much was entailed by the summer holidays when they graduated from senior high school. Regardless of age, this seemed to be the boundary line for parents regarding whether one had grown up, as well as when they were finally willing to let go a little, loosening the rope that they held.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Previously, you were in a cage.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Afterwards, you began to possess those wide plains on which to roam.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Boys would light up a cigarette on their graduation night, ignoring all else. The short skirts of the girls would dazzle everyone’s eyes. There were even those who would bring their boyfriends or girlfriends whom they had hidden for a long time home for their parents to look at that summer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yuewei had virtually spent these entire summer holidays impatiently twiddling her thumbs as she counted down the days.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At the occasional class gathering, her tablemate who had accepted a confession after graduation and embarked on a new relationship would always joke, “Who asked you to like that Xu Tingsheng? Look, you’ve ended up scaring off all those boys who wanted to confess to you after graduation.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Of course Wu Yuewei knew that the person whom she liked was so outstanding in the eyes of others, outstanding to the extent that he seemed suddenly insurmountable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still, she who had always been pure had actually never minded any of this, never considering things from this angle. It was the same even if she heard some negative things being said about her...she clearly knew that he hadn't been this way yet when she had begun liking him.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Therefore, Wu Yuewei just liked Xu Tingsheng regardless of how he was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those three long months had really passed by far too slowly. It was with &nbsp;great difficulty that Wu Yuewei managed to wait it out till they were soon to meet at Yanzhou. She secretly travelled to Yanzhou a day before schedule.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had thought that she would make use of this additional day to take a look at Xu Tingsheng’s university and where he lived and worked.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had thought that it would be best if he was willing to lead her on a tour of his campus, the school fields, the library and classrooms, then sit down to eat together in the canteen. She would ask him, “Right, isn’t it time you changed the bedsheets in your dorm room?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The location of Hucheng’s office could be found online. She had noted it down long ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">From Libei to Jiannan and then to Yanzhou, the bus was jolting along the uneven roads.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">However, while Wu Yuewei carried her heavy luggage and continually switched buses, she did not feel herself to be suffering at all as she was nearly bursting with happiness and anticipation.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Arriving before the riverside residence, she asked a university student she saw downstairs who worked part-time in Hucheng if Xu Tingsheng lived there.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">That person told her that he usually stayed on the second floor.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I’ve found it,” Wu Yuewei carefully adjusted her clothes and dabbed at her sweat, telling herself, “Don’t be nervous.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Still feeling rather nervous, she raised her hand and knocked on the door.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yuewei did not see Xu Tingsheng. Instead, it was a beautiful girl who opened the door for her. There were another two of them sitting in the living room, eating tidbits as they watched television. Wu Yuewei recognised one of them as Apple, Xu Tingsheng’s classmate in twelfth grade who had later become an artiste.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yuewei knew that she too liked Xu Tingsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She was currently in his house.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“So, they’re already living together now? What about the other two girls then?” Holding on to her final vestiges of hope, Wu Yuewei asked in a small voice, “Sorry, does Xu Tingsheng live here?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The girl standing at the doorway replied, “Yes, he does. You’re…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At this point, Wu Yuewei suddenly found that she felt very much like running away. She hastily interjected ‘thank you’ before really seeming like she was running away as she turned and left.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She had been coaxing herself all this time, saying that he wouldn’t change, that it wasn’t important…yet all this suddenly seemed to work no longer.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">…...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng could not get through to Wu Yuewei’s phone. He could only accelerate his car to its maximum speed.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first thing he tried in his search for Wu Yuewei was looking for her along the streets leading to the bus station from the academy city.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">It was best if he could find her like this. If he couldn’t, this would entail that she had most likely gotten on a public bus. Xu Tingsheng intended to drive around for a bit first. If he still couldn't find her, he would go straight to the station to intercept her.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The academy city was located in the suburbs of the city, with only a single path leading from it to the city center.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After driving for more than twenty minutes, Xu Tingsheng found Wu Yuewei walking along a road, dragging a suitcase behind her. He hurriedly found a junction and made a U-turn before following her at a distance that was neither close nor far away.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yuewei’s slender back profile stood out so keenly as she carried a backpack stuffed full of belongings on her back while dragging along a large suitcase with her right hand, her left hand... wiping off her tears every once in a while.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng dialled her number. She stopped walking, took out her phone and looked at it, just looking at it as she refused to pick up his call.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng saw her stop atop a bridge and rest her suitcase against its banister before removing her backpack and resting it against her kneecap...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">She unzipped the bag, seemingly in the midst of searching for something inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yuewei retrieved an intricately, meticulously wrapped box from her backpack. She looked at it for a long time, hesitated for a long time. Finally, she raised her hand, intending to throw the box out…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">A hand reached over, grabbing her hand and the box along with it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Is this a present for me? I remember you saying that I'd get a present when you arrive,” Xu Tingsheng said, “You're not willing to give it to me now? How have I offended you?”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yuewei turned to look at Xu Tingsheng, clenching her teeth as she started to struggle. While she uttered not a sound, she struggled with all her might. This stubborn side of Wu Yuewei’s was something she had never displayed in front of Xu Tingsheng before.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng could only hug her from behind, trapping even her arms as well.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“You're actually stronger than you look.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was what a panting Xu Tingsheng said when Wu Yuewei finally ceased to struggle, smiling as he released his grip. Then, he opened the box which he had just snatched. There was a watch inside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng took off his watch and put on his present.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yuewei said, “Don't wear that. It's very cheap.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng smiled, “I'm wearing it.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Wu Yuewei had worked at Libei’s Happy Shoppers branch for two months over the summer holidays to earn the money to buy that watch. This was something that his sister, Xu Qiuyi, had already told him about previously.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The watch that Xu Tingsheng had been wearing was basically equivalent to what Hucheng earned in an hour. Meanwhile, this one was worth two month's of Wu Yuewei's hard work. Therefore, this watch was really more valuable.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He dumped first the suitcase, next the backpack and finally the person herself in his car.</span></p>
