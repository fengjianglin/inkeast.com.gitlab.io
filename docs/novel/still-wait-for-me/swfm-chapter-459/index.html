 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Chapter 459: What no one knew (2)</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">The recovery period afterwards was blissful and heartwarming. Fang Yunyao let nothing slip. She made herself look happy, filled with hope and certain of their relationship. She wished to leave Fu Cheng with only the happiest memories of their romance.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">The time eventually came for her to be discharged. This also meant that the destined parting was nigh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Upon leaving the hospital, Fang Yunyao made a trip back to Libei and Libei Senior High along with Fu Cheng. That was the place which had bestowed her what she most cherished, yet had also brought her the most harm.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">It was time to say farewell to the fairy tale that had begun there.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Having stared death in the face, in the face of that imminent parting, it seemed that there was really nothing to be afraid of. She decided to be wilful for once, telling everyone that yes, Fang Yunyao had fallen in love with her student, that boy called Fu Cheng...who cared about Mr and Mrs Fu, who cared about whatever gossip flying around.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">She had never been this brave before.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">That day, Fang Yunyao walked gracefully through the entire Libei Senior High with her arm latched onto that of her student, Fu Cheng. That day, the two of them traversed the campus together hand in hand, also traversing the rumours, traversing the years.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Afterwards, in Yanzhou.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fu Cheng moved Fang Yunyao’s belongings from the hospital as well as Libei upstairs to that hotel room they had booked. Fang Yunyao poured him a cup of water. Being alone together in this sort of place, looking at the big bed before them, they were both overcome by nervousness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fu Cheng downed the water in one gulp before getting up a little awkwardly and saying, “I’ll go book another room.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao tidied up the blanket, saying nothing.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fu Cheng stole a few glances at her face, finally venturing very hesitantly, “Ms Fang.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Hmm?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Can I, can I sleep on the floor tonight? I won’t do anything, I’m just afraid that you might be afraid alone, and...I want to remain by your side. There’s a rug here, really, a rug.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao did not look at him as she focused on tidying up the blanket…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fu Cheng just looked at the beautiful her from the side, waiting…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">She bit her lip before nodding lightly as she said, “Ok.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">That day, they ate dinner together and then watched a movie. Fang Yunyao had her arm linked in Fu Cheng’s as they walked, conversing happily. They were like any other happy couple on the street.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">She bought a set of couple pyjamas at the pyjama store.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao took a bath first.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">When Fu Cheng finished bathing and exited the bathroom, there they were, wearing the same style of pyjamas in the room yet both saying nothing. Even the flow of time in the room seemed to have slowed as all that remained was the barely audible sound of breathing.&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fu Cheng opened the wardrobe and found a spare rug which he promptly spread out across the floor.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao turned off the lights.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">The silence of the darkness and the sound of two people breathing persisted for ten minutes, or maybe more.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Come up here and sleep,” Fang Yunyao said.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Her tone of voice was just like when she would say during lessons: Student Fu, you answer this question. Fu Cheng could not help but laugh.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Ms Fang said, “No laughing.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Lying on the same bed, covered by the same blanket, Fu Cheng was shivering slightly, nervous.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao’s tinkling laughter resounded by his ear, as if feeling a sense of accomplishment at his panic. She was indeed feeling much less out of her element than him, even though she too had zero experience in this.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">This could be because she had already made up her mind long beforehand to give him the utmost that was within her capabilities, to grant him whatever fleeting happiness she could.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Fu Cheng…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Hmm?”</span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“I’ll never fall in love with anyone else.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Yes, me too.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“You’re still young. In the future…” Fang Yunyao trailed off.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">She was actually thinking: After I’ve left, you’ll meet someone else. You’re still young, you definitely will. You should love her well.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“I won’t. I’ve never liked anyone else at my age, and this won’t change however much time goes by…” Fu Cheng hastily defended himself in great earnestness, till he felt the person beside him suddenly approach.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao did not continue discussing this topic. She had actually only said those words to tell Fu Cheng that he could have her.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Still, that guy was an idiot.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">A kiss was underway amidst the darkness, the two parties both inexperienced.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fu Cheng’s hands involuntarily sought to investigate places.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">He hastily tried to withdraw them…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao pressed down that slightly trembling hand that was already beneath her clothes, consoling in a low tone, “It’s fine.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">The sound of breathing grew heavier and heavier.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Fu Cheng…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Yes?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Do you like it?” She asked despite her shyness.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Yeah,” Fu Cheng dared not say that it felt great.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“In that case, go on...I’m willing,” She whispered into his ear.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">At this moment, Fu Cheng was wholly certain that this woman beside him was his bride-to-be. And so...he did not stop…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Ms Fang…” Fu Cheng was breathing heavily.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Hey...you...still with the Ms Fang…” Fang Yunyao was the same, though her voice was also filled with a vexed embarrassment.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“I want to turn on the lights.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“No.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“I want to look at you.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao hesitated for a moment. She thought: Alright, so you can remember me by it.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Hold on a second,” Fang Yunyao groped for a pillow and covered her eyes before saying, “Done.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">The lights clicked on. A slight glow permeated her eyelids…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Slowly and cautiously, Fu Cheng lifted the blanket.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“I’ll give you my everything.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">……</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Another day passed.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">The morning of the third day came…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">They were like the happiest, most blessed couple that day, trekking, strolling through a park, going to the seaside…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">That night, Fang Yunyao cracked a rare joke, “Where’s your rug? Why aren’t you sleeping on the floor now?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Looking at her, Fu Cheng smiled.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“What, what’s with that?”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“You’re going to be my wife anyway.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“...And you still always, always call me Ms Fang.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Ms Fang.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Despite two days having been the original plan, Fang Yunyao had deliberately tried to avoid thinking about it. She had already stayed for an extra day. In truth, how she wished that these days could continue forever. How she wished that she would never have to leave…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">In the end, she still made Fu Cheng go back to his university.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Not daring to look at him, she deliberately spoke to him through the bathroom door, “Fu Cheng, you’ve got to properly attend lessons from today onwards. I’ll feel guilty, otherwise. Also, you’ve got to learn how to take care of yourself from today onwards. I’ll worry, otherwise...”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Enveloped in a bubble of bliss, Fu Cheng sensed nothing unusual at all. He knew not that the person speaking to him through that door was leaning back against it with her head upraised, the tears gushing uncontrollably down her face.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“I’ll listen to you then. I’ll go to school and come back in the evening.”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">After Fu Cheng had left, Fang Yunyao numbly packed up her belongings in that empty room. That couple pyjamas of his, she brought along with her too.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">The train was on the move.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Fang Yunyao sent him a final text:</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">Goodbye, my little boy. To me, this risk of a lifetime has thus come to an end. The story is already beautiful enough. Promise me not to look for me. Your Ms Fang. Your Fang Yunyao.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">And she took out her phone card and flung it out of the window, into the neighbouring winds…</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">“Thereon severing the past,</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">To allow a proper tomorrow…”</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">……</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span>&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">She ultimately never revealed why it was that she had to leave.</span></p>
 <p style="margin-right: 0cm; margin-left: 0cm"><span style="color: black">That day, a boy who could not understand why he had suddenly been abandoned wept sorrowfully, wondering unceasingly, “Why?”</span></p>
