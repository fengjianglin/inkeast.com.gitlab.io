 <p><span style>Chapter 269: Fang Yuqing’s assault</span></p>
 <p><span style></span></p>
 <p>Around 7pm, Xu Tingsheng felt hungry.</p>
 <p><span style>He couldn’t return to the riverside residence for the time being. At the very least, Xu Tingsheng couldn’t very well appear again before Lu Zhixin today. Huang Yaming and Tan Yao had driven off to have fun with some medical faculty chicks. They simply wouldn’t even bother inviting him for such matters now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>His remaining roommates were all busying themselves with matters pertaining to members of the opposite sex.</span></p>
 <p><span style>If it was the canteens, there should only be leftovers and cold dregs remaining by now.</span></p>
 <p><span style>The loner Xu Tingsheng wanted to find someone to eat dinner with. In the end, he could only think of Fang Yuqing who was currently just as much as a loner as he was. So he called him.</span></p>
 <p><span style>After hearing him out, Fang Yuqing said, “I’m driving right now. I’m on the way to Suzhou. I bought two dumplings from the service centre just earlier and I’m biting on them right now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taken aback, Xu Tingsheng asked, “And what play are you staging?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Yuqing roared into the phone, “And wasn’t it you who frightened me? My head’s been filled completely with red ever since this afternoon...Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing’s wedding invitation. Whenever I closed my eyes, I would see her wearing a wedding gown and getting wed to someone else. In the end, I couldn’t stand it and just drove out here.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Where are you now?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I just got on the highway a while ago.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Despite thinking this to be great, Xu Tingsheng could not resist teasing Fang Yuqing as he held back his rising laughter, asking, “To ask her if she will invite you to her wedding?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“To tell her that I will definitely marry her before she turns 25,” Fang Yuqing said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Can’t you just call her and tell her that?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You what?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I lost my mind just now and withdrew all my money to buy a ring.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>A ring. He had embarked on a quest of a thousand miles with a single-minded determination to propose? Xu Tingsheng was shocked by the sudden burning passion of the usually lackadaisical Fang Yuqing as he was unable to speak for a time. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Discovering after some time that no response was forthcoming, Fang Yuqing continued, “Hey, say something, will you…to be honest, I'm panicking a little right now...I keep thinking about turning back! What do I do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can't just turn back so easily on a highway, right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, it's fortunate for that.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Scared of getting rejected?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm really kinda. You don't know this, but Yuqing has a soft exterior but a tough disposition. When she refused to stay in Yanzhou, she’d actually already mentally prepared herself for breaking up with me. I've got no confidence of succeeding at all now.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Don’t think about that first, “Xu Tingsheng said, “Won't it be night by the time you get there? Do you know where she lives?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Yeah, I’ve been then before…” Fang Yuqing said, “When her parents both weren't at home once.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You'll have to do it in front of her parents this time then. After all, it's their daughter you want to marry. You can't just propose to her never even having met her parents before.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Why is it that the more you say, the more I want to turn back…”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Turn back and wait to receive her wedding invitation?” Xu Tingsheng breezily replied.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Immediately he heard that characteristic ‘vrroom’ of acceleration from Fang Yuqing’s decrepit Volkswagon. He was going all out. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“I'm hanging up then! Drive carefully, and call me if anything crops up,” He hung up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Therefore, Xu Tingsheng was still ultimately forced to eat alone. Switching buses twice, he found that traditional seafood noodle store that was Xiang Ning’s favourite, ordered the noodles that Xiang Ning had previously ordered for him, and sat down. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Over a year ago, there had once been a period of time during which he had come here to buy takeaway for her everyday. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps because the Xu Tingsheng of back then had liked to chat with the boss a little when standing in front of the counter waiting for the takeaway to be packed, describing Little Xiang Ning as Big Xiang Ning and his previous life as his present life, the boss who ran a thriving business actually still remembered him. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When the store was slightly emptier, the boss made use of this time to come over and greet him, “It's been a long time since you last came.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Tingsheng smiled, “Yeah!”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Your girlfriend doesn't like my noodles anymore?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“She should still like them,” Xu Tingsheng replied, aware that the 22-year-old Xiang Ning had still loved eating these noodles.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Then…” The boss stopped mid-sentence,saying in the end, “Never mind.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Perhaps having seen too many people who had once come together with their partner coming alone before, he knew that he shouldn't be asking about this now. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Although Xu Tingsheng had always come alone back then, he had been able to tell that he came with happiness in his heart each time. He liked talking about that girl whom he had never brought over before. </span></p>
 <p><span style>After Xu Tingsheng had finished eating the noodles, the boss walked over, carrying a cup in one hand and a set of takeaway noodles in the other. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“The is strawberry wine personally brewed by my family. It's distilled from high-grade white wine; you're guaranteed to be dizzy with a single cup. These noodles are the same as what you just ordered. Choose one of the two; that'll be on the house.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Give her the noodles or drink that cup of wine, drunkenly returning home alone to sleep.</span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Tingsheng understood what he meant. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Seeing how he remained silent, the boss waited for a bit before putting down both the cup of wine and the noodles. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“You can only choose one. We're a small business,” The boss smiled as he offered.</span></p>
 <p><span style>…...</span></p>
 <p><span style>Staggering back to his dormitory, Xu Tingsheng found it already closed for the night. Unable to enter, he could only find a hostel to stay the night. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When Fang Yuqing’s call came in, he was already blearily about to drift off into sleep. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Xu Tingsheng gave him a random ‘hey’. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Yuqing asked, “What's with you? Your voice isn't right?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“I drank a little and ate two bowls of noodles, one of them by the roadside,” Xu Tingsheng said, “But enough about that already, let's talk about you first. I just love hearing stories about how fools throw everything aside and go all out before their stories then end in great tragedy.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Yuqing went ‘scram’ before saying, “I'm outside her home district now, but I don't dare to go over. What should I do?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Go find a provisions shop nearby, buy an Erguotou and bottoms up,” Xu Tingsheng said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Okay,” Fang Yuqing said.</span></p>
 <p><span style>……</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Yuqing downed two whole bottles of Erguotou, because he discovered that just one wasn't enough. Then, he called Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The first thing that Fang Yuqing said was, “Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing, don't you marry someone else.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Taken aback, Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing asked, “Are you drunk?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Yuqing said, “I'm already outside your home district right now. I, I've bought a ring.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing said, “Stop it, Yuqing. You're drunk.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Yuqing asked, “Don't believe me? I'll come and knock on your door in a bit then. Open the door for me if you dare. I wanna propose.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing was silent for a long time, low sobs audible on the other end of the phone before she said, “I've thought about it, Yuqing. I’ve thought about it. But remember two semesters ago, when we ran into your parents out on the streets and I met them for the first time? I never thought about it again afterwards. The reason I'm still together with you now, unafraid of what others may say behind my back, is that I wanted to accompany you for another two years.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Yuqing was crying as well, “I know, but don't you care about them. You will open the door in a while, won't you?”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing stopped emphasising ‘you're drunk’ as she coaxed Fang Yuqing as she would a kid, smiling even as she wiped off her tears, “Alright, alright, I'll open the door for you. Is there anyone beside you right now? Hurry up and go home.”</span></p>
 <p><span style>Fang Yuqing hung up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing called him again, but he did not hear it. </span></p>
 <p><span style>He knocked on the door of her home. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Then, at that very instant when the sound of the doorknob turning resounded, he knelt down on one knee, opened the box containing the ring and raised it up high. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The door opened.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“Wi, will you marry me?” The drunken Fang Yuqing was still feeling nervous, stuttering &nbsp;flusteredly as he dared not raise his head. </span></p>
 <p><span style>When some time had passed and he still could hear nothing, Fang Yuqing looked up. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Um…hi, auntie…” He said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>Next, a middle-aged man walked over as well. Just like his wife, Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing’s father was stunned silly by the scene before his eyes. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“My name is Fang Yuqing, and I want to marry your daughter, Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing,” Fang Yuqing said. </span></p>
 <p><span style>The sound of a door opening resounded before hurried footsteps could be heard. Soon, a pyjamas-clad Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing appeared behind her parents. As she stood there, she saw Fang Yuqing who was kneeling over by the doorway.</span></p>
 <p><span style>“You, you really came?” A blushing Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing asked. </span></p>
 <p><span style>“Heh,” A drunken Fang Yuqing laughed in a silly manner before looking up and saying to Yu</span><i><span style>q</span></i><span style>ing’s parents, “That's her, it's her I want to marry. Your daughter.”</span></p>
