 <p>Chapter 213: Thirty yet inexperienced</p>
 <p>The old man had talked about the spirit of life. Xu Tingsheng directed his gaze upwards. On a large wooden board was printed in both Italian and Chinese: An Artisan’s Spirit.</p>
 <p>It was unknown if this was the shop’s name or Mister Angelo’s personal motto.</p>
 <p>The woman turned and conveyed Xu Tingsheng’s words to Mister Angelo.</p>
 <p>The old man smiled and nodded towards Xu Tingsheng, extending a hand in a ‘please’ gesture.</p>
 <p>“Mister Angelo’s meaning is that if the three of you feel that there is no problem, I will now begin introducing to you the material, style and prices of the suits and also collect your physical data.”</p>
 <p>The woman finished speaking.</p>
 <p>Xu Tingsheng heard two gulps from behind him, the sound of people swallowing their saliva.</p>
 <p>The so-called collection of physical data should be doing the measurements. The three of them imagined it. Waistline, chestline and shoulder width, huh? There would be the feeling of hugging this way, the feeling of a hug from behind.</p>
 <p>Then the length of their legs and the hipline...that would also have to be measured, right? This...wah…</p>
 <p>Now, even Xu Tingsheng was feeling a little worried that he might not be able to bear it.</p>
 <p>The trio was wholly ignorant regarding the style and material of suits, including the matching of the shirt, belt, tie and leather shoes. They also didn’t intend to stubbornly feign experience here.</p>
 <p>Therefore, the three of them just extremely straightforwardly accepted all the proposals made to them by the woman.</p>
 <p>In truth, from how Huang Yaming and Tan Yao appeared nervous and eager to please, even if the woman were to propose that they wore four-inch high-heeled shoes, they would definitely also accept this without the slightest hesitation.</p>
 <p>They quickly finished the selection within a mere twenty minutes. The total price of the three complete suits was nearly 180000 yuan. This was even with the woman having meticulously planned it out for them as much as possible.</p>
 <p>Hearing the reported price, Xu Tingsheng rubbed his head.</p>
 <p>This seemed to be the first time ever since his rebirth that he was spending so ‘extravagantly’ on himself. From the looks of it, learning how to spend money was not that much easier than learning how to earn money, especially for a former destitute person like Xu Tingsheng whose heart would really ache beyond compare at this.</p>
 <p>When the time came to take their measurements, Xu Tingsheng was forced to go first. Huang Yaming and Tan Yao both secretly expressed that they needed a bit of a breather, trying their best to suppress the reactions in a certain part of their body.</p>
 <p>Yet, after Xu Tingsheng was done taking measurements and their turn came, those reactions still unavoidably appeared.</p>
 <p>“This is the greatest respect towards a beautiful woman by a man. It indicates recognition of her charm. Get it?”</p>
 <p>Tan Yao was the last one to take the measurements. During this time, Huang Yaming scooted over to Xu Tingsheng’s side and defended himself in a low tone.</p>
 <p>At the same time, he also told Xu Tingsheng reproachfully, “It’s just you who doesn’t know how to show her any respect at all.”</p>
 <p>Xu Tingsheng ignored him, carefully observing the woman’s expression.</p>
 <p>She should have discovered it. At first glance, she appeared very calm. Still, carefully observing a little longer, disgust and helplessness could be seen within her eyes. She felt mortified, but forcibly tolerated it, unceasingly adjusting her facial muscles so as to keep the emotions from showing on her face.</p>
 <p>“A very interesting woman,” Xu Tingsheng thought.</p>
 <p>A problem cropped in the final stage of the suit-ordering process that had been completely successful otherwise.</p>
 <p>When the woman conveyed the old man’s words that the earliest they could collect the suits would be two months later, Xu Tingsheng stifled a smile as he glanced at Huang Yaming who appeared incomparably despondent.</p>
 <p>The cocktail party would be four days later.</p>
 <p>“Are you in a rush?” The woman seemed to tell something from their expressions as she asked on her own accord.</p>
 <p>From the looks of it, she seemed to be hesitating about something, having something to say yet still ultimately not voicing it out.</p>
 <p>“Right, we’ll be needing it four days later, so…” Xu Tingsheng said apologetically, “Can I trouble you to explain things to Mister Angelo and see if the process can be sped up? We can consider adding on some money as appropriate.”</p>
 <p>The woman nodded before turning and conversing with the old man for a bit.</p>
 <p>“I’m really very sorry. Mister Angelo expresses an inability to complete it within that timeframe and hopes that you can understand this.”</p>
 <p>The woman conveyed the old man’s words, next helping to explain, “They’re generally unwilling to hurriedly manufacture a product, because so long as a flaw or deficiency appears, the first to be unable to accept this would be they themselves. Elite Italian artisans are extremely adamant in this area. Also, with Mister Angelo’s age…”</p>
 <p>“I understand. It should be us who’re sorry. Coming over to order suits for the first time, we didn’t understand the specific procedures, thus having taken up your time. Please understand this, and help me to express my apologies to Mister Angelo as well,” Xu Tingsheng apologised.</p>
 <p>“It’s fine,” The woman answered.</p>
 <p>“Well, we’ll be taking our leave then.”</p>
 <p>Xu Tingsheng led along Huang Yaming, his face full of pain and regret, as well as Tan Yao as he bowed deeply in apology to the old man before leaving the workshop.</p>
 <p>When taking the lift down, Huang Yaming and Tan Yao were still glancing back very reluctantly at frequent intervals. It was unknown whether the two of them were feeling regretful at the very first tailor-made suit of their lives or if they still wanted to look at that woman.</p>
 <p>“That woman’s really too flavourful,” Huang Yaming was feeling emotional throughout.</p>
 <p>“What about the suits?” Tan Yao asked.</p>
 <p>“We’ll just have to make do with some mass-produced ones for now,” Xu Tingsheng said.</p>
 <p>As they conversed, the trio arrived on the pavement downstairs. The sound of high-heeled shoes clattering on the ground resounded from behind them. Huang Yaming dragged Xu Tingsheng to a halt. He had some sort of premonition, or perhaps it was just anticipation.</p>
 <p>Soon after.</p>
 <p>“Three...sirs, please wait a moment?”</p>
 <p>The woman’s voice resounded amidst the noises of the cars speeding along the road. While it wasn’t loud, it could be distinctly heard. This is because every time you are anticipating, waiting for a voice, that voice is just always able to penetrate through the noisiest environment, seeking out your ears.</p>
 <p>Xu Tingsheng turned, feeling rather puzzled.</p>
 <p>Huang Yaming enthusiastically snatched a reply, “Hi, you’re...talking to us?”</p>
 <p>The woman’s expression changed unceasingly, seeming like she was in a bit of a dilemma as she was still clenching her teeth after a while, “It’s like this. I’d like to ask-could you hand those three suits you ordered over to me to make? I’d be able to complete them on time. Please trust me; I studied in Italy before for six years. One of my teachers was a very good friend of Mister Angelo’s and also extremely skilled in the tailoring of suits.”</p>
 <p>Huang Yaming and Tan Yao both began nodding in a wholly unprincipled manner from the side.</p>
 <p>Xu Tingsheng remained silent, waiting.</p>
 <p>“A hundred and fifty thousand. No, a hundred and forty, I’d do it for a hundred and forty,” As Xu Tingsheng appeared unmoved, the woman lowered the price on her own initiative before then continuing, “Also, I have the materials. Coming here today, I had intended to sell some fabric that I brought back from Italy to Mister Angelo. It’s, it’s the types that I recommended to you earlier...still, I wasn’t lying to you. These are indeed suited to you.”</p>
 <p>Xu Tingsheng nodded, smiling, “I trust you. Still, I have a question. Four days, three whole suits. Those four from Mister Angelo’s wouldn’t have been able to complete them in time. What makes you think that you can?”</p>
 <p>“I can just not sleep. Then, my mother was once very famous in Shenghai City. With her skills, she can help me to cut the cloth and sew on the buttons. Also, there’s a senior expert from my family who can help out as well,” The woman seemed to see hope as she frantically explained.</p>
 <p>“Alright then,” Xu Tingsheng said.</p>
 <p>Originally having appeared very hard to persuade, Xu Tingsheng had suddenly acceded to her request so straightforwardly. The woman was unable to immediately come to terms with this as she looked blankly at him.</p>
 <p>This woman seemed to naturally possess a ‘delicate, pitiful look’. Just this blank look alone caused the hearts of these three guys who were more than ten years younger than her to twinge involuntarily.</p>
 <p>“Thank you,” She lowered her head after a while.</p>
 <p>“You’re welcome. You may not be too used to it, but it’s actually just business,” Xu Tingsheng said, “I’m Xu Tingsheng. Remember my handphone number, and call me when you’re done.”</p>
 <p>“Alright. My, my name is...Li Wan. My number is…” The woman took down Xu Tingsheng’s handphone number before reporting her own name and number, finally saying, “I’ll call you when I’m done then. Thank you.”</p>
 <p>Then, she was like a panicked hare wanting to flee as she hurriedly turned, preparing to leave.</p>
 <p>“Thirty yet inexperienced.”</p>
 <p>This was Xu Tingsheng’s current evaluation of Li Wan.</p>
