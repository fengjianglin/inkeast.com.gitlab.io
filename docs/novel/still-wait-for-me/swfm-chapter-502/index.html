 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Chapter 502: The old hand He Yutan</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><br></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As this was not an actual company meeting, the emcee Hu Chen adjusted the mood after the hot-bloodedness and high spirits at its commencement. He concisely summarised what Xingchen had done over the past year and what its target for the coming year was.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He did not speak much, not listing statistics or exaggerating anything as he simply expressed everything as they were.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xingchen had done pretty well in the first year since its establishment, powerfully rising to prominence. It was hoped that they could do better for the next year, for which there were basically two goals: Staunchly, unwaveringly standing strong and expanding their territory.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">As soon these two goals were mentioned, those of Xingchen amongst the audience were naturally led to think of the battle between Xingchen and Tencent which had still yet to reach a conclusion even now.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Faced with that destructive competition as both sides had virtually thrown out all semblance of civility, it had not been easy for Xingchen at all. Still, they had soldiered on…</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xingchen was tough and brave.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xingchen was also stifled, its future even seeming a bit bleak. After all, all the enterprises that had clashed head-on with Tencent or tried to challenge it before thus far had met bad ends.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Furious voices resounded amongst the audience as well as bits and pieces of discussion containing considerable unease.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Seeing this, Hu Chen gazed at Xu Tingsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng nodded and took over the microphone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“I know what you’re discussing, what you’re all worried about.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng cut to the chase and said to his employees and the distinguished guests in a heavy tone, “Regarding this problem, I would like to say three things to everyone here today. Firstly, an interesting piece of information. To date, Tencent has attempted to poach a total of seventeen of Xingchen’s programmers and management personnel, more than ten percent of our numbers. Even our esteemed Boss He is counted amongst them. I feel very happy about this, because it shows that you are very valuable, very desirable assets…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng intentionally eased the atmosphere a little.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Amidst the ensuing laughter, He Yutan appreciatively got up and cupped his hands smilingly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Sigh...who asked me to be second fiddle?! See, they just won’t try to poach Hu Chen. Why’s that? Because he’s the main. I also have no way of knowing if Little Ma would give up his seat for me if I really went over,” He Yutan jokingly feigned an aggrieved tone.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“Actually, the main reason I didn’t go is that I’m afraid Little Ma would bear a grudge, hating me for going around and criticising him and suing him. He might cheat me over and then take revenge...Boss Xu and Boss Hu, these black-hearted fellas, both left the task of offending others to this shameless old man.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“There’s no way around it now. These old bones of mine can only stay to sink or swim together with Xingchen’s vessel, all paths of retreat abandoned…”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While that earlier part could simply be thought of as a joke, this last sentence of Old He’s could actually be considered a proclamation of his stance, an expression of his determination.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While He Yutan who was in his fifties was not all that old, he was unquestionably an old man in terms of experience and seniority in the internet industry within the country.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">He was part of that first batch of people who had pioneered the internet markets in the nineties. In the many years of his career, he had been in many internet enterprises which had once been or were even now still greatly renowned. He knew many people and could get many things done as many people had to give him face.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some people within the industry slandered him in private, sometimes calling him Old Slickhead or even Old Scoundrel.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Yet, this Old Scoundrel had gone around and around and ultimately entered an unexpectedly effective partnership with Hu Chen who was more than ten years younger than him and had a relatively cultured air about him. He also seemed to have a pretty high opinion of Xu Tingsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">In contrast to how he would simply leave for other pastures at the slightest whim in the past, Old He had painstakingly invested his time and effort to the utmost ever since Xingchen had been established.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Asking for favours, cursing and cussing...Old Scoundrel had been leaping about doing just about anything for Xingchen. In choosing the 2005’s top ten newsworthy figures for internet enterprises, Xu Tingsheng and Hu Chen had not entered the media’s list. It was only Old He who had been selected as he represented Xingchen Technologies.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">On the category of reason for nomination, another old hand of the industry, albeit one who had already retired to the backlines, had personally penned: People often say that amongst us old fellas, regardless of result, it’s only Old He who’s never tried to take an enterprise to the peak before. As on old friend, I can tell that he is serious this time. Be more mindful, everyone. An old hand’s blade is still very sharp.”&nbsp;</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">And he was right, really. Only those truly within the industry and close to the pinnacle knew how irreplaceable and essential He Yutan’s accumulated experience, knowledge and connections were for the newly arisen Xingchen.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">At his words, the laughter at the scene escalated. Still, it was all positive and admiring. Any slightly deviant, angered or worried feelings from earlier had since begun to slowly revert.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the advantage of having an old hand by their side.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“All ended in failure,” Xu Tingsheng struck while the iron was hot, declaring these four words when the laughter had still yet to subside.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“They attempted to poach seventeen people. Of these seventeen attempts, all ended in failure,” Xu Tingsheng explained and emphasised.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Everyone burst into applause as cheers resounded. The guests who had been invited to witness the gathering realised with a start that while there had been a hint of chaos and disunity earlier, all that remained at this moment was that rousing vigour of battling against a common enemy.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After today, others might still try to poach those of Xingchen. Some might even succeed. After all, such a thing was really too common in the internet industry. Still, it was probable that no one would be able to bring themselves to even entertain the thought of possibly joining Tencent.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Xu Tingsheng nodded and indicated for them to be silent before he continued, “The second thing. Xingchen will be stronger. Weixin will not die. The domain of instant communication-it definitely will see our flag stamped within.”</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While his tone was not rousing, it was reliable and utterly sure, evoking confidence in others.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Those of Xingchen in the audience silently clenched their fists as they gazed at Xu Tingsheng.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was probably also the first time the invitees were witnessing Xu Tingsheng in his entirety, this young man who had soared to great heights over the past few years. They also felt rather emotional now, thinking to themselves that it was really ‘no wonder’...</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">“The third thing. Strong as strong may be, we’ll breathe and we’ll live. Don’t forget, tonight’s our celebration banquet. Please enjoy yourselves!” Xu Tingsheng concluded as he smiled brilliantly.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Then, he waved and returned to his seat.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">After the applause was a stretch of relaxed, smiling faces.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The proceedings continued.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">The first programme was a catwalk.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Old Jin had originally wanted this to take place after the employees had had some to drink and were rolling in high spirits. Still, Hu Chen and He Yutan had immediately rejected this proposal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">This was the annual gathering of a legitimate celebrity internet enterprise. It’s okay if you go in playing the rich guy. Still, it’ll be no minor matter if some dude acts inappropriately when drunk and causes a scandal.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">While there was still a distance between the performance up on stage and an underwear show, it was already not that far from it. As Old Jin was the one organising the annual gathering, Xu Tingsheng’s tolerance level was already very high at this point in time. He decided to just sit back and ‘enjoy’ it.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Beneath the beguiling music played by the DJ, there came the elegant poise and strutting.</span></p>
 <p dir="ltr"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-weight: 400; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; text-decoration: none; vertical-align: baseline">Some only had eyes for the faces and beautiful features.</span></p>
